00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,880
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,800
And today we've got a very interesting lesson for you all about building your vocabulary.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,880
So we're trying to describe personalities.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
You're going to learn tons of new words.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Exactly.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,840
And as you said, we're going to describe people's personalities.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,960
So not their physical attributes.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
We're going to concentrate on how they are personality wise and stuff like that.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
Their character.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
That's right.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,600
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue for the first time and we'll be back in a

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
moment to talk about some of these great words.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,080
Okay, class, settle down.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,480
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,560
I'm going to hand them out and if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
the class.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
I'll read mine.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,080
Okay, go ahead.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,840
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing and easygoing.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,880
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
That's not true.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, the test isn't 100% accurate.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
Is that all it says?

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
No.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,240
It also says that I'm open minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,840
and clumsy.

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,160
This is stupid.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,200
Okay.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,120
Anyone else want to read theirs?

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
I'll go.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,840
It says that I'm an extroverted, well balanced person.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,920
It says I am generous, outspoken and very diligent.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,300
This is so true.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,040
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent and daring.

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
This is totally me.

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,120
Whatever.

39
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,080
These tests are baloney.

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,680
All right, we're back.

41
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,140
So we're going to divide this up into language takeaway parts one and two.

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,040
So let's start with five key words now on language takeaway.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,320
Language takeaway.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,200
The first adjective that came up was adventurous and outgoing.

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,340
Outgoing, that's a good one.

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,400
Outgoing is a great one.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
So think of the word out.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
That means moving out, going out.

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,820
Outgoing means someone is very comfortable talking to strangers or talking to people

50
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,960
that they don't know very well.

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,560
For example, my brother is very outgoing.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,600
He loves meeting new people.

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,640
He loves starting conversations with strangers.

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,480
So the opposite would be shy.

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
That's the opposite.

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
Okay, so outgoing.

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,520
And then it also described this person as being a little superstitious.

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,320
Okay, superstitious is very interesting because it's hard to describe since everyone's superstitions

59
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,360
are different.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,000
In many cultures, there are different superstitions.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,880
So for example, in America, we say that walking under a ladder is bad luck.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,200
Or opening an umbrella inside is bad luck.

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,920
So if you believe that your actions will bring you bad luck, you're probably superstitious.

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
Okay, very good.

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,840
So if you are superstitious, you believe in superstitions.

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
That's right.

67
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
So Marco, are you superstitious?

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,200
Do you think that black cats bring bad luck?

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
No, not at all.

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
No.

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
That's very interesting.

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
All right.

73
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,120
And this is also an interesting word, a way to describe people who are very believing,

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
a person that is naive.

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,480
Okay, you said this already.

76
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,160
Naive means that someone generally believes most things that you tell them.

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,560
So if I told you, Marco, hey, did you know that it's supposed to rain frogs tomorrow?

78
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
No way.

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Really?

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Yeah, really.

81
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,020
If Marco believes me, he's naive.

82
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,000
That means that probably it's not going to rain frogs tomorrow, but he believes everything

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I say.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
So he's a little bit naive or inexperienced.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,120
So naive is not really a bad way of describing a person, is it?

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
No, but it can be.

87
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,980
So you want to be careful.

88
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,600
Some people, if you say that they're being naive, it's offensive.

89
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,880
So you have to be careful when you say this.

90
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay.

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,080
Moving on, we also had an interesting adjective that described another person, and it was

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
to be reckless.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,880
I can also be reckless.

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Reckless.

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Okay.

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,760
So someone who is reckless often does things without thinking, sometimes things that are

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
dangerous.

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,680
For example, Marco, I think that driving a car without wearing your seatbelt is very

99
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
reckless.

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Okay.

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,480
That means that you're not thinking about safety.

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Right.

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,520
So a person that is reckless is a kind of a synonym of being a little bit dangerous to

104
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
be around.

105
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
That's right.

106
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,960
So someone who does things without thinking about their consequences, their results.

107
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Okay.

108
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,320
And also along with reckless, the test said that this person was clumsy.

109
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, I love this word.

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,560
There was a very famous commercial when I was growing up in America on the television.

111
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,520
It was all about young students at high school who are clumsy, and so they should buy this

112
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,080
special folder for their schoolwork to help them because they're so clumsy.

113
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
And they're dropping their papers and their books.

114
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Exactly.

115
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,920
So someone who is clumsy often falls down or hits their head or trips or drops their

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
things.

117
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,400
If I drop something on the floor and break it, my mother might say, you're so clumsy.

118
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Clumsy fingers.

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
You should be more careful.

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Yeah.

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
So clumsy, is this insulting if you say, oh, you're so clumsy?

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,440
No, it's not so bad.

123
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,420
There are worse things to say.

124
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,280
But if someone often drops things, you can call them clumsy.

125
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Or you can also say, you're such a butterfingers.

126
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Butterfingers.

127
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,960
That means that your fingers are like butter.

128
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
They're very slippery.

129
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,200
You drop everything.

130
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Okay.

131
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,480
So clumsy and reckless, they are negative adjectives, right?

132
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,680
They're saying that you do things wrong.

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,880
So it's not really a good thing to be reckless or clumsy.

134
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
No, it's not really a good thing.

135
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,440
These are not positive characteristics.

136
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,880
Okay, good.

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,600
So we took a look at those five, which are very good about one of the people that took

138
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
the test.

139
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Let's move on now to more language and more adjectives on Language Takeaway part two.

140
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,720
Language Takeaway.

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,880
Alright, so in this part, we're going to take a look at positive attributes about a person,

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
right?

143
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,320
They're all good things about someone.

144
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
That's right.

145
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,520
And this first one is very good.

146
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Extroverted, extroverted.

147
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,320
A person that's extroverted.

148
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,120
So a synonym of this word is outgoing.

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,560
Okay, so it's pretty much the same thing.

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,320
That's right, because extra means going out, out.

151
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,360
So in this case, someone who is extroverted often meets new people, goes out and does

152
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,480
social things, goes to the movies, goes out with friends, meets strangers, talks to strangers.

153
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Again, it's like being outgoing.

154
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,240
Someone who's comfortable with new people.

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,160
And what about the opposite?

156
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,440
So we said that shy is the opposite of outgoing.

157
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,920
What would be the opposite for extroverted?

158
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Extroverted's opposite is introverted.

159
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,200
Intro means in, not out.

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,480
So that means someone who's very shy, who is uncomfortable with new people.

161
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Okay.

162
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,320
And well, apart from being extroverted, the test also said that this person is very diligent.

163
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,200
Ooh, diligent is a great word.

164
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,240
This is a word you want to hear from your teachers and your bosses.

165
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,280
Okay, if someone says, Marco, you're very diligent at work.

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
What does that mean?

167
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
It means you're very careful.

168
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,480
You always do things very thoroughly.

169
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,020
And also quickly, right?

170
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,080
When you tell them to do something, they do it immediately.

171
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
That's right.

172
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,600
So a diligent worker always does a good job and does it in a timely manner.

173
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Okay.

174
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,280
And moving on to our third adjective.

175
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,880
This one is kind of strange.

176
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,520
It kind of sounds like monogamy, but it's magnanimous.

177
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Magnanimous.

178
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
All right.

179
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Magnanimous.

180
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,800
This is a great word.

181
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,400
We hear this a lot in the newspaper or on TV about usually famous people.

182
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,780
He did something very magnanimous or it was a magnanimous gesture.

183
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,960
This describes a person who does things for the benefit of other people.

184
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,520
Who is thinking about the well-being and the health and the lives of others.

185
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
So it would be a person that likes to share or a person that's not selfish.

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Right.

187
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,480
So if you donate half of your salary this month to victims of an earthquake, I would

188
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,920
say, Marco, that's so magnanimous of you.

189
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,480
You're so magnanimous.

190
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Okay.

191
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Awesome.

192
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,720
And apart from being magnanimous, if a person is eloquent, I guess that's also a positive

193
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
attribute.

194
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Yeah.

195
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
This is another really good one.

196
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,160
Someone who is eloquent is a very good speaker.

197
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,080
This means that when they talk, they sound very, very good.

198
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,100
Someone who's eloquent uses big words, but is also very good at making other people listen.

199
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,420
So it's usually about speaking.

200
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,660
So you would say he's an eloquent speaker.

201
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
That's right.

202
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,700
So someone who is eloquent is fun or good or interesting to listen to.

203
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,920
And our last description for personalities and the way people are is a person that's

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
daring.

205
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
Well, this can be a good thing or a bad thing.

206
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,360
It depends on who you're talking about.

207
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,400
Because sometimes daring people are also reckless and this can be dangerous.

208
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,520
But sometimes someone who is daring can be doing good things.

209
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,360
Like a daring business person might take risks that other people don't take.

210
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay.

211
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,480
So a person that's daring dares to take risks, right?

212
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
You are very daring.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,960
You Marco are daring because recently you jumped out of an airplane.

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah.

215
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,040
You did some skydiving.

216
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,540
So that would be considered daring.

217
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
That's very daring.

218
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,360
I'm not daring like that because I would never jump out of an airplane.

219
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Right.

220
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Okay.

221
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,040
So we took a look at basically 10 key words here.

222
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,400
A lot of adjectives, but they're a great way to describe yourself.

223
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,240
Maybe if you're at a job interview, sometimes a typical question is, how would you describe

224
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,360
yourself using three adjectives?

225
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm extroverted, I'm diligent, and I'm open-minded.

226
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Yeah.

227
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
That's awesome.

228
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
See?

229
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
You sound really professional when you say things like this.

230
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Give me the job.

231
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Yeah.

232
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Exactly.

233
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,440
So and even if you took a look at some of the negative adjectives that we used, it's

234
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,160
also a typical job interview question is like, what are your biggest faults?

235
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,360
So you can say, well, maybe I am superstitious and naive.

236
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,840
You wouldn't want to say that in a job interview.

237
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,400
But I mean, I don't know, maybe.

238
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,640
Because you have to say something, right?

239
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
You do.

240
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,240
But I would say, sometimes I'm a bit too daring or sometimes I take things personally.

241
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,960
So we can talk about that another time.

242
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,480
But I think for now, it'd be good if we listened to today's dialogue one more time and really

243
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,360
got a good sense of how to use these words.

244
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay, class, settle down.

245
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,040
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

246
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,760
I am going to hand them out.

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,920
And if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

248
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
I'll read mine.

249
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,620
Okay, go ahead.

250
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,380
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing, and easygoing.

251
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,400
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

252
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
That's not true.

253
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,800
Well, the test isn't 100% accurate.

254
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Is that all it says?

255
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
No.

256
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,760
It also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless

257
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,380
and clumsy.

258
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,680
This is stupid.

259
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,640
Okay, anyone else want to read theirs?

260
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I'll go.

261
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,360
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

262
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,440
It says I am generous, outspoken, and very diligent.

263
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
This is so true.

264
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,560
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent, and daring.

265
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,520
This is totally me.

266
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,640
Whatever.

267
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,560
These tests are baloney.

268
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,920
Alright, we're back.

269
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,200
So now going into descriptions.

270
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,020
What are three adjectives that you would use to describe someone that you hate the most?

271
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:33,640
So going back to describing people, how would you describe one of the main things that really

272
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,160
irritate you about someone?

273
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Maybe if they are clumsy, it really bothers you that people are clumsy or reckless maybe.

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
I see what you're saying.

275
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,200
Well, I really like extroverted, hardworking people, but in English we have a word to describe

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,540
someone who is too extroverted, too hardworking.

277
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,360
We call this person a type A personality.

278
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,880
Type A. Type A.

279
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,720
The letter A. And this means someone who works very, very hard, who is very, very serious,

280
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,200
but who's always anxious, always needs to get things done.

281
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,880
And so these people can be very hard to work with because they're controlling and they're

282
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,040
never calm.

283
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
So they're not easygoing.

284
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,080
No, they're not easygoing.

285
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,500
They always want to do what they want to do.

286
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,560
They're usually not very good listeners.

287
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,120
And so this type A personality is something that I would say I'm not a big fan of at work

288
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,560
or even when we're going out because with friends, it's hard to be around someone who

289
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,320
always has to control you.

290
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,560
This is very interesting.

291
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,720
And I'm sure our listeners have a lot of different ways to describe things that irritate them,

292
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,040
maybe about people or maybe attributes that they really admire about someone.

293
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
That's right.

294
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,520
And I want to give everybody a little bit of homework today.

295
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:55,160
Go home or if you're at home, look up a word in the dictionary that describes yourself.

296
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Yeah.

297
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,080
An adjective to describe yourself.

298
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,360
I think this is a really good homework assignment because you'll be improving your vocabulary

299
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,520
and then put it on our website, EnglishPod.com.

300
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,000
Let us know more about you.

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay.

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll see everyone there.

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Bye everyone.
