00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,180
My name is Katrin and we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you guys today.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,740
This one is all about a crime scene.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,740
That's right.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,360
So we are going to be at a crime scene.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,720
We are with the police officers and we're going to take a look at some very, very interesting

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,920
and specific vocab to like police and a crime and all that.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
That's right.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,920
So if you are a fan of the TV show CSI or you like some of these investigation police

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,400
work TV shows, this is a lesson for you.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
That's right.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:49,880
So why don't we go and listen to the dialogue for the first time.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,680
All right, Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
What are we looking at here?

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,200
Detective McGee, I'm glad to see you.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,400
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,880
It's a break in, but nothing seems to have been stolen.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,160
We received a call from the Bear family at around 1030 this morning.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,320
They'd gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,880
Apparently Mama Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
They were waiting for it to cool down.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,380
Okay then, let's start examining the evidence.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,040
Have the forensics team been in yet?

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Yes sir.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,400
We found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,360
Hmm.

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,760
Aha!

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,360
What's this?

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
A strand of golden hair.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,800
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,440
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair and very few men have long golden hair.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,880
So our criminal could be a woman.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,080
A woman?

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
Was she working alone?

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,720
Did she have an accomplice?

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
An accomplice?

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
No.

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
No, McGraw.

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,000
She was definitely working alone.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
See here, there are footprints in the porridge.

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,860
Here on the floor, small footprints.

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,840
This tells me that our suspect is small and could possibly be a child.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,560
A child?

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,140
Surely not, sir.

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,360
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
The evidence doesn't lie.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,920
Now let's reconstruct the crime.

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,240
The suspect came in, sat in each chair breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,400
Next, the porridge.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,080
She obviously tried to eat it and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor,

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
making this mess.

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Hmm.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Interesting.

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,440
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
Well, there was no one down here.

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,320
Maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Hey, what's with all the noise?

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,320
I'm trying to sleep up here.

63
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
There she is.

64
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Get her.

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,360
Alright, we're back.

66
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
So a lot of interesting phrases there.

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,440
They are obviously investigating a break-in.

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,820
Okay a break-in, yeah.

69
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,400
So someone broke into this family's house.

70
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,360
So they have to investigate the evidence and some of the things that were left behind.

71
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,520
So now why don't we take a look on Language Takeaway, some of the specific words they

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,200
used.

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
Language Takeaway.

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Alright the first word that we have is forensics, the forensics team.

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Forensics team.

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,320
So a forensics team is a team at a police department or police station that studies

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
the things that are left behind after a crime.

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Alright so that team goes and collects the evidence.

79
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,520
So you could look at hair or fingerprints or footprints, things like that.

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,640
A forensics team is kind of like a team that puts together puzzle pieces trying to figure

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,840
out what the story was.

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,400
So as you said, the TV show CSI, the whole show revolves around, follows a group of forensic

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,000
scientists who go to crime scenes and look at blood and different pieces of evidence

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,240
that are left behind.

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Very cool.

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,840
So one piece of evidence that a forensics team might look at is a fingerprint.

87
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,600
That's right, a fingerprint or in the dialogue we found fingerprints, the plural form.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,480
Okay so for example, if you go to a police station because the police think that you

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,840
have committed a crime, the police will take your fingerprints.

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,120
That means they'll put your finger, that means they'll put your fingers into ink and they

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
will make you push your fingers onto a piece of paper to see what your fingers look like.

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
That's right.

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,000
So our fingerprints have a unique pattern.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Everyone has different fingerprints.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
There are no two fingerprints alike in the world, right?

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
Right, so it's kind of like a form of identification.

97
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Very good.

98
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
That's right, so that is your fingerprint.

99
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
So moving on, we talked about fingerprints and the scientists who are investigating the

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,520
crime scene and they are talking about a very important piece of trace evidence.

101
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,240
Okay well let's look first at the second word there.

102
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,840
We've got the word evidence.

103
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:24,040
So evidence is something that is usually physical like a piece of clothing or hair that can

104
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,120
be used against someone when we're trying to prove that they have committed a crime.

105
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Right, so for example a weapon or fingerprints, all that is evidence.

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,520
Okay so Marco, what's the difference between evidence and trace evidence?

107
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Well as you notice you have the specific word there, trace.

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,640
And to trace means to follow or to connect, right?

109
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,600
So what you're doing here is you're taking this evidence to follow or connect the person

110
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,640
that committed the crime.

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,600
So for example, fingerprints lets you know who committed the crime.

112
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Okay, or maybe if you have blood you can find out who did this crime.

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Right.

114
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,720
But what about like a broken window?

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,080
Well that's just evidence.

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,040
It just lets you know how the crime was committed, maybe how they got into the house.

117
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
But not who did it.

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
But not who did it.

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,520
Okay, so trace evidence helps you connect the crime to the person who committed the

120
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
crime.

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,280
And well moving on, we found that very important piece of trace evidence which was a piece

122
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,560
of or a strand of golden hair and the police officer said, well this tells me that the

123
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,380
suspect has long golden hair.

124
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,080
So a suspect.

125
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,120
Okay this word, it looks exactly the same as the word to suspect.

126
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,120
But be careful because we say these two words in different ways.

127
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,880
So to suspect, that's a verb.

128
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
That's right.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,220
So I suspect Marco did it.

130
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,120
So that means I think or I imagine.

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,320
Right, whereas a suspect, a noun, a suspect is a person.

132
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,480
So the person who we think or the person who the police think committed a crime.

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Okay.

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,720
So for example, we're talking about some trace evidence like long blonde hair.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,840
That means the suspect is probably a woman and is probably blonde.

136
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Very good.

137
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,040
And it's interesting that you use the verb to suspect and a suspect all because you're

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
not sure yet.

139
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,560
So this person may have committed the crime or may not.

140
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
That's right.

141
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
So we have to wait until the trial.

142
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,800
We have to wait until we prove this person is guilty before we can say that they actually

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
committed the crime.

144
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Very good.

145
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay.

146
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,480
And well, you have a suspect and usually you also have somebody who is an accomplice to

147
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,080
the crime or to the suspect.

148
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Okay.

149
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,960
So a suspect, as we said, is a person.

150
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
It's a noun.

151
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,520
So is an accomplice.

152
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,600
So accomplice is a suspect's helper.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Right.

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,680
So basically if you're robbing a bank and I wait outside in the car, right, while you're

155
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
robbing the bank, then I am an accomplice.

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
That's right.

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,240
And under most laws, you could be sentenced to jail.

158
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Right.

159
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,000
So the accomplice usually doesn't commit the crime, right?

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,040
You robbed the bank, but I just waited outside in the car to drive you out.

161
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
So I didn't rob the bank.

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Right.

163
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,520
But sometimes accomplices do also have guns and shoot people or knives.

164
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,760
So an accomplice is basically just the helper of the criminal, but they can get in trouble

165
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
too.

166
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Right.

167
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,440
So basically it's a person that helps out and knows about the crime, but didn't tell

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,680
the police about it.

169
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Exactly.

170
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,240
That's a really important aspect.

171
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Okay.

172
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,000
So a lot of interesting words there all related to crimes.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,480
Why don't we move on now to a couple of different phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency

174
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,120
Builder.

175
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Fluency Builder.

176
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Okay.

177
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
I like this.

178
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,800
This first phrase, it's a phrase you might hear a lot actually in police shows.

179
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Give it to me straight.

180
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Give it to me straight.

181
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Actually, also you can use it when you're just talking to someone and they're like hesitant,

182
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
right?

183
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Like, I don't know how to tell you this, but...

184
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm not so sure.

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,600
I don't think you're going to like what I have to say.

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,000
So I can just say, okay, come on, just give it to me straight.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't like your shirt.

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No, I'm just kidding.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a nice shirt.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,240
But what you're basically asking for is the person to say, be honest with me.

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Be direct.

193
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,480
Be direct.

194
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,640
Straight can mean both of those things, honest or straightforward or quick.

195
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,800
You don't want someone to go around and around and say lots of different things.

196
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,360
So I guess, yeah, that does make sense.

197
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,400
Give it to me straight maybe comes from straightforward.

198
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,240
So to be straightforward is to not hesitate to just say something directly and honestly.

199
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Exactly.

200
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay.

201
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
So moving on to our next phrase, McGraw is talking about the bulls and he said, well,

202
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,000
they are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
As we speak.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,360
So this is actually a phrase that refers to time.

206
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,320
So in this instance, what he's basically saying is right now.

207
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,420
They're being analyzed right now or in this moment.

208
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,960
So it's a way of indicating that something is happening at this very moment.

209
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Exactly.

210
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,120
So I could say, did you know that the president is giving a speech as we speak?

211
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Okay.

212
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,840
So that means the president is talking right now.

213
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Exactly.

214
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
As we speak.

215
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Okay.

216
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Very good phrase.

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,920
Now, moving on to our third phrase, Detective McGee was talking about reconstructing the

218
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
crime.

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
He said, let's reconstruct the crime.

220
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Okay.

221
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,880
So I don't know if any of you watch these crime TV shows like Dexter or CSI.

222
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,760
This is my favorite part because they tell you exactly what they believe happened.

223
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,300
So to reconstruct means to build again or to recreate, to create again.

224
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,920
So basically they start at the beginning and they pretend to follow what happened during

225
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,320
the crime.

226
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,440
So that's basically the verb to reconstruct, to rebuild, recreate.

227
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
Okay.

228
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,920
Reconstruct the crime.

229
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Very good.

230
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,440
And what about our last phrase?

231
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay.

232
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
So our last phrase is again, a very typical police phrase.

233
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,440
We hear this a lot when there's been a crime or on TV when they're talking about the scene

234
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
of the crime, that means the place where the crime happened.

235
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,640
And the police say we need to clear the scene or did the officers clear the scene?

236
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,840
So to clear means to empty out.

237
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Right.

238
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,800
But they're not talking about emptying out the evidence or removing everything from the

239
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
house.

240
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,120
They're just saying to remove people, right?

241
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Right.

242
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Or obstructions.

243
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Exactly.

244
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
So a police officer would want to make all the people go away.

245
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Well, because you don't want people stepping on the evidence or maybe putting their fingerprints

246
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
all over the place.

247
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Right.

248
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,120
So it's very important that the officers, the police officers clear the scene so that

249
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
they can start their investigation.

250
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Right.

251
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Very good.

252
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
A lot of interesting phrases there.

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think we should go back.

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,720
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll come back and talk a little

255
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
bit more this.

256
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,720
And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this really interesting topic.

257
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,120
All right, Officer McGraw, give it to me straight.

258
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
What are we looking at here?

259
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Detective McGee, glad to see you.

260
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,800
We could sure use your expertise on this one.

261
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,240
It's a break in, but nothing seems to have been stolen.

262
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,560
We received a call from the Bear family at around 1030 this morning.

263
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,720
They'd gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess.

264
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,320
Broken chairs and porridge all over the place.

265
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,240
Apparently Mama Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see.

266
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,000
They were waiting for it to cool down.

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,780
Okay, then let's start examining the evidence.

268
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,440
Have the forensics team been in yet?

269
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes, sir.

270
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,080
They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as

271
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
we speak.

272
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,440
Hopefully they will be able to identify the burglar soon.

273
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,800
Hmm.

274
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Aha!

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What's this?

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,920
A strand of golden hair.

277
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,200
This is a very important piece of trace evidence, McGraw.

278
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,840
It tells me the suspect has long golden hair, and very few men have long golden hair.

279
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,280
So our criminal could be a woman.

280
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,480
A woman?

281
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,920
Was she working alone?

282
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,120
Did she have an accomplice?

283
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
An accomplice?

284
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
No.

285
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
No, McGraw.

286
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
She was definitely working alone.

287
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,640
See, here there are footprints in the porridge.

288
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,240
Here on the floor, small footprints.

289
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
This tells me that our suspect is small, and could possibly be a child.

290
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,080
A child?

291
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Surely not, sir.

292
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,760
We must follow the clues, McGraw.

293
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,200
The evidence doesn't lie.

294
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,320
Now let's reconstruct the crime.

295
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,600
The suspect came in, sat in each chair breaking the smallest one into little pieces.

296
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,680
Next, the porridge, she obviously tried to eat it, and because it was so hot she dropped

297
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,160
it on the floor, making this mess.

298
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,000
Hmm, interesting.

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
These footprints seem to lead upstairs.

300
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,760
McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?

301
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,160
Well, there was no one down here.

302
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Maybe we forgot to check upstairs.

303
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Hey, what's with all the noise?

304
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm trying to sleep up here.

305
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
There she is!

306
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:32,840
Get her!

307
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,440
So you mentioned a couple of different shows, such as Dexter and CSI.

308
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,960
Do you watch any of these shows?

309
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I do.

310
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,520
I'm a big fan of Dexter.

311
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,680
And Dexter, as you know, works at a police station in Miami.

312
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,480
His character is in forensics.

313
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,720
He analyzes blood.

314
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,680
Right, he's like a blood expert.

315
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,600
But it's interesting because he is actually, he commits crimes himself.

316
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,200
So he uses his knowledge to help him to not get caught.

317
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,840
Right, so he's both a criminal and he's a police officer.

318
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
But he's kind of like a superhero criminal, right?

319
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,640
Because he doesn't kill for fun or pleasure.

320
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,680
He just takes out people who kind of deserve it, right?

321
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes, but he does kind of do it for pleasure because he's obsessed.

322
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,740
He can't not kill.

323
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,720
So instead of killing good people, he decides he will only ever kill bad people.

324
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
It's a really good show.

325
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,260
I've watched a couple of episodes and it's very, very good.

326
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,800
The same as CSI.

327
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
There are a couple of different versions.

328
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,280
There's CSI Miami, New York, and Las Vegas.

329
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
But my favorite is Las Vegas.

330
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
It's very, very good.

331
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,120
And also Law & Order.

332
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,080
I've watched a couple of episodes of Law & Order.

333
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
It's pretty good.

334
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,760
Yeah, they often talk about forensics because they have both parts.

335
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,080
They have the police part and the law part with the lawyers who have to use the evidence

336
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
in court.

337
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,160
Very interesting.

338
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,660
And there's also, well, forensic scientists, they take a look at the evidence.

339
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,840
But I think also they examine the body back at the morgue, right?

340
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
That's right.

341
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,120
They look at the body to find out what happened to the body.

342
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,040
This is all a part of reconstructing the crime.

343
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,520
So this person is also sometimes called a coroner, right?

344
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, the person who analyzes the body.

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,320
It's pretty scary though if you think about it, having to analyze a body.

346
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
I think you have to be very experienced.

347
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
It's a very interesting...

348
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,480
I don't even know how somebody becomes a forensic scientist, for example.

349
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Do you study this in school?

350
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh, you can go to school for it.

351
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Yeah, they have lots of forensic programs.

352
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,560
I think I saw on Discovery Channel, they have a reality TV show about forensic students

353
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,840
and they're actually taken to real crime scenes and then they get eliminated one by one.

354
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,160
I'll have to look it up.

355
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,800
Well, I'm curious to know, have you ever heard of this before, forensic science or forensic

356
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
anthropology?

357
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,560
There are lots of people who study this and who do this as a job.

358
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,340
And if you're not interested in that, maybe you could tell us about what kind of crime

359
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,760
drama TV shows you like, because we certainly love them here.

360
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
All right, we'll see everyone there.

362
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Bye.
