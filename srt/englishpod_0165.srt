00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Hello, English learners and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,920
And my name is Catherine and today we're talking about money, but this time we're talking about

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,920
borrowing money.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Right.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,140
So, we're asking for money.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,360
We're going to the bank and we are asking for a loan.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,840
But before we go, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,360
Okay, so a loan is some money that you get from the bank.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,000
So we're talking about requesting a loan today.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Alright, so you request for a loan or you ask for a loan.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Exactly.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
So to request is to ask.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,320
Okay, very good.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,120
And that's the word that we have for vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:52,440
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,520
Hello sir, may I help you?

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,880
Yes, I would like some information for requesting a loan.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Very well.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,140
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,160
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,640
I see.

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,440
So let me get this straight.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,760
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,120
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,780
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,520
to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,680
portion of the annual interest rate.

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,600
This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment.

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,960
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,440
I have a terrible credit score.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,840
That is a very serious problem, you see.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,640
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,840
information, such as your credit score, in order to approve your loan.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
You know what?

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,720
I don't really need the money.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Thanks anyways.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,120
All right, we're back.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,280
So now why don't we take a look at some of the key words that we'll find in Language

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,560
Takeaway.

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,160
All right, so on Language Takeaway today, we have a couple of different words.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
Why don't we start off with the loan policies?

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,040
Okay, so a policy is like a rule.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,960
For example, a government can have policies, but in this case, a loan policy is the rules

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,680
regarding the loan that you have.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,640
Right, so maybe the loan policies could include what's the maximum length of your loan, or

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,520
maybe what's the annual interest rate, et cetera.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,680
How much you have to pay each month, like that.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Exactly.

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,560
So a policy is the rules related to the loan that you've taken out.

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,520
And we have some very, very important words following this, and they go together.

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,080
So the first word is to borrow.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,480
Okay, so you probably know this word already, to borrow.

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880
So can I borrow your pen?

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Can I borrow some money?

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,640
Sure, let me give you my pen.

59
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Let me give you my money.

60
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Okay.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
But wait, giving is different, because giving means I don't have to get it back.

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Right.

63
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,040
So if you want to give it to someone temporarily, then you lend them your pen, or you lend them

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
some money.

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Great.

66
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,400
So to borrow is to take something from someone, knowing that you will have to give it back

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
later.

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Right.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,360
And to lend is to give it to someone, right?

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,160
So can you lend me your pen?

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
That means can you give it to me, please?

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Right.

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,400
And this is a common mistake with language learners, especially English learners, that

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,560
they make the mistake of using borrow instead of lend.

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,600
So can you borrow me some money?

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Right.

77
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
So can you lend me some money?

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,640
Sure, but I expect you to pay me back later.

79
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, very good.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,400
And if I pay you back later, I'll include an interest rate.

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Will you really?

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
No, not really.

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
No, not really.

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,260
Mostly it's banks that ask for an interest rate.

85
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,040
So in this case, an interest rate means the amount of money that a bank will charge you

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,440
in addition to the money that you owe them.

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Exactly.

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,920
So it's called an interest rate and it's a rate because it's a percentage.

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
So it's like 5%.

90
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Exactly.

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,520
5, 10%.

92
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,880
That is an interest rate.

93
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,120
And now moving on, if you have a loan and you have to pay each month, be careful to

94
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,720
not default on your payments.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
Okay, default.

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,140
In the banking world, this means to not be able to pay your loan.

97
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:44,280
So that means that if I owe $1,000 to you, Bank of Marco, and I don't have the money,

98
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,960
I can't pay for it, then I default.

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
So to be late or to not make the payment.

100
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,280
It's a verb, to default.

101
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Very good.

102
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,440
And Will, the person asking for the loan has a small problem.

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,800
His credit score is not very good.

104
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay, I think he calls it terrible.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
And one of the ways that you get a terrible credit score is by defaulting on a loan.

106
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,000
But it also means that maybe you borrow money or you have credit cards and you can't pay

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
off your bills.

108
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,160
And so a credit score is very important in America and it's like a report card for your

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
finances.

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Right.

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,640
So for example, if your credit score is a report card and you have an A credit score,

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,360
that means that the banks won't have a problem with lending you money.

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
Or if you want to buy a new car, it'll be okay.

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,900
But if you don't pay your bills on time or you default on your loans, then maybe you'll

115
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,600
have a C or a D and then people will not really lend you money in the future.

116
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
They won't trust you.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Exactly.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,280
All right, so that's credit score.

119
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,120
That's all the words we have for Fluency Builder.

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,240
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,680
Hello, sir.

122
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,160
May I help you?

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,560
Yes, I would like some information for requesting a loan.

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Very well.

125
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,800
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
I see.

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
So let me get this straight.

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,440
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,460
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have

132
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,200
to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small

133
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,340
portion of the annual interest rate.

134
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,240
This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment.

135
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,440
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

136
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,080
I have a terrible credit score.

137
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,500
That is a very serious problem, you see.

138
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,320
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant

139
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,520
information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
You know what?

141
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I don't really need the money.

142
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Thanks anyways.

143
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Alright, we're back.

144
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:13,520
So now, why don't we take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
Let me get this straight.

146
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
We're going to do Fluency Builder?

147
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
That's right.

148
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Wait, I don't.

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Wait.

150
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
So, okay.

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
So this is our first phrase.

152
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,560
Let me get this straight, and this is a fixed phrase that means we always say it the same

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
way.

154
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Wait, let me get this straight.

155
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
We always say it the same way?

156
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,200
Right, so you're asking for a confirmation or you're repeating what that person said

157
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,240
just to be sure that it's correct.

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Exactly.

159
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,840
So, maybe you don't understand something or maybe you think you might have misunderstood.

160
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,440
You say, hey, so let me get this straight, and you repeat what the person just said.

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
It's a way for you to, like you say, get confirmation on what you've heard.

162
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Very good.

163
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
Let me get this straight.

164
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,880
And now, moving on, we have the phrase, pay it back.

165
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,440
You have to pay it back.

166
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,960
Okay, and so in this case, we have the verb to pay, but we also have the word back.

167
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,600
So pay it back means to repay.

168
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,800
So if we take out a loan, we obviously have to pay it back to the bank.

169
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Right, so you have to pay the loan back.

170
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,400
Okay, so just remember that these words often go together, to pay it back.

171
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
I'll pay you back, I promise.

172
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,160
Right, can you lend me a dollar?

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

174
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
Nah, don't worry about it.

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,240
Alright, and the bank started off saying, we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest

176
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
rate in the country.

177
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Yeah, right.

178
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
Alright, so we pride ourselves.

179
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,440
What does it mean if I pride myself in something?

180
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,360
The word pride means to be really happy about something that has to do with yourself.

181
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,760
So something that you're proud of is something that you want to tell a lot of other people

182
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
about.

183
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,920
For example, a father may say, my son just got straight A's and he's an excellent soccer

184
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,000
player and so he's proud of his son.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,760
But to pride oneself means to be really happy with the way that you do something.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,520
Right, so for example, if I've never smoked, right?

187
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,440
So I can say, I pride myself in being a non-smoker.

188
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Or I could say, I pride myself in always saving lots of money for my paycheck.

189
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Very good.

190
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
So it means I try to do this because I know it's a good thing.

191
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,240
But you feel very good about this and you feel that people should be proud of you as

192
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
well.

193
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,920
So we could ask our students here, what do you pride yourselves in as a challenge?

194
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,560
As a challenge for the website.

195
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:39,480
Alright, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,560
Hello sir, may I help you?

197
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Yes.

198
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
Would you like some information for requesting a loan?

199
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Very well.

200
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,200
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,200
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

202
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,680
I see.

203
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,480
So let me get this straight.

204
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,800
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

205
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,160
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

206
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,800
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have

207
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,560
to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small

208
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,700
portion of the annual interest rate.

209
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,600
This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment.

210
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,000
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,440
I have a terrible credit score.

212
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,840
That is a very serious problem, you see.

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,600
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant

214
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,840
information, such as your credit score, in order to approve your loan.

215
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
You know what?

216
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,720
I don't really need the money.

217
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Thanks anyways.

218
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,520
Alright, very good.

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,640
So as you say, saving is important.

220
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,160
And well, sometimes, do you think you need a loan?

221
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,040
I think sometimes people need loans because they want to go into business, for example.

222
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,360
So people who want to go into small businesses or open their own companies need startup capital.

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,280
This is a really great example of when people don't have the money lying around and will

224
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,680
go to find a bank that will give them a loan.

225
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,440
So yeah, I think it's really important, especially for the economy of a country, for business

226
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,080
loans or small business loans to be available because sometimes it's very difficult to find

227
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,760
a bank that will actually lend a person money to start a business.

228
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Usually they won't have a problem with lending them money to buy a new car, but to start

229
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,280
up a business, it's completely the opposite.

230
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
It is.

231
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,280
And one of the really popular trends in foreign investment right now is called micro-lending,

232
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,360
so micro-loans.

233
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:54,240
And that means that if I want to help people in a very poor country, I can lend $100 for

234
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,240
someone to buy a sewing machine or for someone to buy a small computer, $500 for a small

235
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,360
computer, and that is a micro-loan.

236
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,080
It's a very, very small loan for one thing, and that can help them towards their goal

237
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,520
of being a business person.

238
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Right.

239
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
And you're not really getting money out of it, though.

240
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
You're not charging like 100% interest rate.

241
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
You're not.

242
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,040
You're charging like 1 or 2% interest, very low interest, and you're giving people a chance

243
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,320
to pay the money back because it's such a small amount.

244
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Wow, that's really good.

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
A really positive thing.

246
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Very good.
