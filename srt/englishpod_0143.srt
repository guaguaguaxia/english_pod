00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,020
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,640
And today we're going to be visiting one of my favorite places, I must say.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
Really?

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,160
So you're a big meat eater?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
I am.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,360
I have to have meat every day, so that's why I usually go to the butcher.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
All right.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,320
So vegetarians be warned, today's dialogue is all about eating meat and where to go to

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
get meat.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,440
So as Marco said, that place is called the butcher's.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,240
So we're going to be visiting the butcher and we're going to learn all the different

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,520
types of meat you can find there.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Great.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,080
So we don't have anything to preview, but before we get started, just like to mention

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,040
that you're going to hear a lot of different kinds of words and we'll be back in a minute

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,440
to talk about what they mean.

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:57,680
Hi, what can I get for you?

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,360
I'd like half pound of ground beef, please.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,920
Good choice.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,200
Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,840
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,400
No, no, no chicken breasts at the moment.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,960
But we have some nice chicken thighs.

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,480
No, that won't do.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,080
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,960
Sorry, is there anything else?

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Is this salami and bologna you have here?

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,720
Yes, it's very fine meat.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,960
Made it myself.

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Sounds good.

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Okay, that's it.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Wait, we have T-bone, rib eye and sirloin steaks.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,200
They are very fresh.

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,120
Just came from the slaughterhouse.

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,480
No, that's okay.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,240
Really, I think that's all for today.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Okay, that'll be $34.50.

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,200
All right, we're back.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,120
So this butcher was kind of creepy in the beginning.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
Very creepy in the beginning.

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,080
I think that's usually the conception that you have of butchers because they always have

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,240
a knife and they're always covered in blood, but it's not human blood.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Right, like the movie Sweeney Todd.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Did you see that?

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Yeah, like Sweeney Todd.

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,240
The butcher of Fleet Street.

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,000
But we actually took a look at a lot of different types of meat that the woman was ordering.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,600
So why don't we take a look at these now in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Language Takeaway.

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,680
Okay, so the first is a classic cut.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,560
This is something that we had at my house about once a week growing up.

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,120
It's called a pork chop.

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,440
Pork chop.

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,000
So a pork chop comes from the animal, the pork or pig.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,360
Yeah, we actually don't say pork to mean the animal.

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,960
Pork just means the kind of meat that comes from a pig.

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,520
So big difference there when we're talking about food, we say pork.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Oh, wow.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
And what about a pork chop?

62
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,160
So what exactly is that?

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,040
Chop is usually just on the bone and oftentimes it's fried or baked, I guess, but it's just

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,520
a piece of pork on the bone and a chop, you just imagine a knife chopping something.

65
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,880
All right, so a pork chop, very good.

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,440
And after pork chops, we were ordering some ground beef.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,040
All right, so ground beef is another important one.

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,280
Ground beef is beef that's been chopped up and pushed through a machine that kind of

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,400
pushes it out in very, very small bits and pieces.

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
There's no bones.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,240
So ground comes from the verb to grind.

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,800
So to grind up meat, to make it very, very small pieces.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,760
Right, so if you want to make a spaghetti bolognese, the kind of beef you use is ground

74
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,320
beef or even hamburgers.

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh, yeah, exactly.

76
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,420
So ground beef, you ground up beef.

77
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,600
What other things would you grind?

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,280
You could grind your teeth.

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
Some people do that when they're sleeping, they grind their teeth.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
You can grind, you have pepper grinders.

81
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,760
You know, peppers sometimes come in balls and you have to grind them to make them smaller

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
and broken down.

83
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Very good.

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,440
So that's ground beef and from the verb to grind.

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Now we are buying some boneless chicken breasts.

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,440
All right, so boneless, as you have guessed, means without bones.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,280
And chicken breasts are usually just a really nice, juicy, kind of tender cut of meat from

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,720
the chicken, from the underside of the chicken where obviously, yeah, they have it.

89
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,240
It's not a wing, it's not a leg, it's just a chicken breast.

90
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
All right, so boneless chicken breast.

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
Now usually it is boneless, right, when you buy it at the supermarket.

92
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,360
Next up, we've got some classic deli counter favorites.

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
These are our cold cuts.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,240
All right, so cold cuts.

96
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,280
Now this means that they are cold?

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, well, yeah, they're cold.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,560
But I think cold cuts, the most important thing to remember here is that they're mostly

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,900
like kinds of salami or cured meats.

100
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,680
So these are salt cured or they're dried meats.

101
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,760
And you usually have them on sandwiches, so like a salami sandwich.

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,040
So like cured meat, you mean that meat hasn't been cooked?

103
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,560
Oh, no, it's not been cooked, but it's treated in a way that allows it to last for a very

104
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
long time.

105
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,200
So they look like long, long tubes of meat.

106
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
They look very dry.

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,440
They look very dry, like beef jerky, for example.

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
All right, so cured meat.

109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,160
Now, for example, we have salami and bologna.

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Bologna.

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,440
Now, it's interesting because bologna is actually spelled B-O-L-O-G-N-A.

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,080
So you would say bologna or something like that.

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,440
Well, I think it comes from the Italian bologna.

114
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,280
But it's definitely a change that happened in the English language when it came over

115
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
from Italy.

116
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
But bologna is a kind of meat that's got a very funny looking name.

117
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
Yeah, see, you're more sophisticated than I am.

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
That's why you know this difference.

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I just speak Italian.

120
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,680
All right, so you have salami, bologna, and...

121
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Pastrami.

122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Pastrami.

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
What about ham?

124
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Is that considered a cold cut?

125
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,560
You can have ham in the cold cut section because ham sometimes comes in tubes that you slice.

126
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
But ham is also just a normal kind of pork.

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
But ham is cured, you know.

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Like a smoked ham.

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Exactly.

130
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,880
Or smoked turkey, one of my favorites.

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Very good.

132
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,760
And, well, now moving on from the cold cuts, we're going to concentrate on steaks.

133
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,200
Ooh, steaks.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,240
So there are a thousand kinds of steaks in this world and every city seems to have its

135
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
own kind.

136
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,520
But here we're only looking at three, the first of which is the T-bone.

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,840
All right, the T-bone steak, I think, is one of the most popular ones.

138
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Definitely.

139
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,640
It's a steak that's pretty big, right?

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,200
Yeah, well, yeah, it can be.

141
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,480
And it has a bone inside that looks like a T.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,300
All right, so you're saying, Marco, that the T-bone is named after the shape and the look

143
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,300
of this steak.

144
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,160
Yeah, T-bone steak.

145
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
All right.

146
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,920
And as well as our next one is also a rib eye.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay, so the rib eye, I think, actually has a piece of the rib in it.

148
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,840
So the rib is the bone and there's a circle, which is kind of a, it's, it's a, the piece

149
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,600
of meat is sliced off the rib and the circle is actually part of that rib.

150
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,560
So there's a little bit of bone in it.

151
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,920
But it's not as bony as the T-bone.

152
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Right.

153
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,400
So it does have one small bone that kind of looks like an eye because you can see through

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,560
it.

155
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,920
And our next steak has no bone and is the most tender and the best steak you can have,

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
sirloin steak.

157
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,080
So I think the, the sirloin is definitely the most expensive if you're in a restaurant.

158
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,320
Definitely the most tender, I think, of all those.

159
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
It's delicious.

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,840
And usually you can have like a big sirloin steak, like a half a kilo, like a 400 gram

161
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
sirloin steak.

162
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,600
I had a friend who ate a full kilo.

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Really?

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Sirloin steak.

165
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Wow.

166
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Is there a competition or?

167
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,520
No, there's a kind of steak called la bistecca alla fiorentina in Italy.

168
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,800
It's the Florentine beef steak and it is, it can be about a kilo of meat.

169
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Wow.

170
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Yeah.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
I bet you can't even move after that.

172
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,240
No, you're, no, you fall asleep with your head in your soup on the table.

173
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
All right.

174
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,960
So that's all the meat related words that we have for you today.

175
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,920
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder where we're going to take a look at some of

176
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,040
the phrases in this dialogue.

177
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,700
Fluency Builder.

178
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,520
We're going to look at the phrases if you know what I mean.

179
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,000
If you know what I mean.

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
Now I love this phrase, if you know what I mean.

181
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I do know what you mean.

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Well, it's weird.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,760
I like it too.

184
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,960
So you can use it for sarcasm.

185
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Yeah.

186
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Right.

187
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,720
Or you can use it to kind of insinuate something.

188
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Right.

189
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Exactly.

190
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Yeah.

191
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
So here's what you're saying.

192
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,900
You're saying there's a double meaning in what I want to say.

193
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,800
So there's two things I could say and I'm not going to say it outright, but you know,

194
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,600
this thing that we can't really say.

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,200
So for example, we can say she likes to go out if you know what I mean.

196
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
All right.

197
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,240
So you're insinuating that not only does she like to go out, but maybe, maybe she goes

198
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,600
out a lot, a lot, or maybe she gets drunk or something like that.

199
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Yeah.

200
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
So it's kind of like a double meaning, but you're trying to be subtle.

201
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah.

202
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,640
But it's not so subtle because you're actually saying like, this is not what I mean.

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Or she's eating for two if you know what I mean.

204
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
There we go.

205
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,680
So you're insinuating that, well, you're not really insinuating, you're telling me that.

206
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
She's pregnant.

207
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,960
Eating for two is a common idiom in English that means that a person, a woman has a, well,

208
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
is going to have a baby.

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,800
So here I'm saying, hey, do you know this idiom?

210
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
She's eating for two if you know what I mean.

211
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Right.

212
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Wink, wink, wink.

213
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Wink, wink.

214
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,240
So now why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use if you know what

215
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,720
I mean in different circumstances when you're trying to insinuate something.

216
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,760
Example one.

217
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,920
She's eating for two now, if you know what I mean.

218
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Example two.

219
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,520
Tim hit a home run today, if you know what I mean.

220
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,000
Example three.

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Jim and Laura are going their separate ways, if you know what I mean.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
All right.

223
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,480
We're back.

224
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,240
So now that that's clear, why don't we move on to our next phrase?

225
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
So this one is a counting phrase.

226
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,440
And for those of you who have heard the word dozen before, it might not be so new.

227
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,080
The phrase is half a dozen.

228
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,160
Half a dozen.

229
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,680
So that means half of 12.

230
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
12.

231
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,860
So a dozen is 12.

232
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,160
And it's, I'm not really sure when this started being used in English, but a dozen is 12 and

233
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,000
half a dozen is then six.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,640
Now there's another phrase or another saying that's very common, a dime a dozen.

235
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,360
He's a dime a dozen.

236
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,120
So that means you can get 12 of the same type of guys for 10 cents.

237
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Right.

238
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
So they're easy to find.

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
They're easy to find.

240
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Yeah.

241
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
The dime a dozen.

242
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
All right.

243
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Very good.

244
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
And moving on to our last one.

245
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,960
When they were talking, they said something about the meat being lean, extra lean.

246
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Okay.

247
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Lean, this does not mean lean on a door.

248
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,160
This is not like resting on something.

249
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,960
This is actually a kind of way to describe food.

250
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,600
And so food is lean if it's not got much fat, it's not fatty.

251
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Okay.

252
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,120
So if it's lean, it doesn't have much fat.

253
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Exactly.

254
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,680
So I prefer to eat lean meats.

255
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
So I often eat birds and poultry.

256
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,760
So chicken, I like it pretty lean.

257
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,120
And if it's got fat on it, I'll cut the fat off.

258
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Oh, okay.

259
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Like the skin.

260
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
The skin is fat, right?

261
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Yeah.

262
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
All right.

263
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
So you can have lean beef.

264
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,680
It doesn't have much fat around it.

265
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Yeah.

266
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,640
And actually on the packages at the supermarket, it often says the percentage of meat that

267
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
you have.

268
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,640
So it's 95% lean or 98% lean.

269
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,440
So that means you have 3% fat in there.

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Exactly.

271
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Or 2%.

272
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,840
My math skills are amazing.

273
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
All right.

274
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,240
So now that we've finished with all of these words on Fluency Builder, let's take a look

275
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:22,320
at our dialogue for the last time.

276
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:42,560
Hi, what can I get for you?

277
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:52,640
No, no, no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.

278
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,160
No that won't do.

279
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

280
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Okay.

281
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,640
Is there anything else?

282
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,200
Is this salami and bologna you have here?

283
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,680
Yes.

284
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,400
It's very fine meat.

285
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,640
Made it myself.

286
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Sounds good.

287
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Okay, that's it.

288
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,720
Great.

289
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,240
We have T-bone, rib eye, and sirloin steaks.

290
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,880
They are very fresh.

291
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,240
Just came from the slaughterhouse.

292
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
No, that's okay, really.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,680
I think that's all for today.

294
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,600
Okay, that'll be $34.50.

295
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,880
Alright, we're back.

296
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,860
So Catherine, are you a big beef or meat eater?

297
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
Definitely am.

298
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,180
It helps that my partner in crime is from Kansas City and they have the best, among

299
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,520
the best steaks in our entire country in Kansas City.

300
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Wow.

301
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,800
I actually miss, there was back in California, we had the $6 burger from Carl's Jr.

302
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,080
It was just basically beef, bacon, cheese, it was just like this huge burger full of

303
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,240
meat and obviously a lot of calories.

304
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,480
But it was delicious.

305
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,120
In Ecuador we are very used to having some meat product every day with our food.

306
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,640
Yeah, well it's the same in the Midwest actually from where we're from.

307
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,440
It's the same in the Midwest because people in the Midwest generally think that if you're

308
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
not eating meat then what are you eating?

309
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Bread?

310
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Right.

311
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Corn?

312
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Yeah.

313
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,360
So meat is considered a healthy part of the day and you definitely eat it with your meals.

314
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah, and I'm sure our vegetarian listeners might not appreciate this but it's just kind

315
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,000
of different diets.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,640
Some people eat, for example, rice every day.

317
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,960
So where in other countries you wouldn't really have rice every day.

318
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,240
Or for example, when I was in Chile, I had a lot of potatoes.

319
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Really?

320
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
A lot of potatoes.

321
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,800
Have you ever had an Argentine steak?

322
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
I hear they have the best beef in the world.

323
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,320
They are not only delicious but they are very inexpensive and it's amazing.

324
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,440
You can have a complete steak buffet for like, I don't know, I can't even remember but I

325
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,520
sat there for three hours and couldn't move and kept eating.

326
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,680
Is it true you can eat it with a spoon?

327
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
It's so soft?

328
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,480
Some of the meat is very, very tender.

329
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
Not if it's grilled, you can't really do that, but in other preparations it's almost like

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that.

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
With a nice butter sauce.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Mmm, herbs.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Making me hungry.

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
I know, you've made me hungry.

335
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,720
I think we're going to take off and have some burgers.

336
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,600
If you have any questions, any comments, please come to our website at EnglishPod.com and
