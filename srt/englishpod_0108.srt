00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,880
Welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,920
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,960
And today we're going to be bringing you bad news.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
That's right.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,880
Actually, what we're really going to be bringing you is language to talk about bad news.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Exactly.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,320
So maybe you have to give bad news to your boss, to your parents, I don't know, somebody,

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
and we're going to be teaching you how to do this in English.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,040
Well, obviously, it's always difficult to tell somebody bad news, but in your second

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,520
language, it's even harder.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,720
So we're going to try and help you today with some great phrases and vocabulary items.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,560
We're not going to preview anything today.

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,660
Let's go directly to our dialogue where we will be in a company and one of the employees

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,860
is going to be giving bad news to his boss.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:54,720
So let's listen.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,480
Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
us some good news.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,560
Well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
What?

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,760
Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,440
Well, sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, 50% in the past month alone.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,800
We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,320
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
of our staff.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,040
If we consider redundancies, it costs us a fortune because of the new regulations governing

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,560
compensation packages.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
It's a real mess.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,760
You're crying out loud.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,000
How fast are we losing money?

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,540
How can I put this?

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,920
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter 11 in less than three

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
months.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
What?

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,000
Jeez, how could this have happened?

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
So what's the bad news?

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,320
Oh, that's the really bad news.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,840
Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,120
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part, we're

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,720
going to have to shoulder this cost.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,600
Are you joking?

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Get the supplier on the line now.

45
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,980
We tried that, sir.

47
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,120
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
Oh, we're doomed.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,440
There's some really good news, though.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Really?

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
What?

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I got offered a new job.

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,040
All right, it sounds like a pretty tough time for this company, doesn't it?

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
But good news for the employee.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
He won't be jobless.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,240
Well, I guess he knows when to get out.

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,960
But why don't we take a look at some of the language now in Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,320
So in Language Takeaway today, we have five vocabulary items and, well, let's start with

59
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
the first one.

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:50,560
All right, so the boss, he's talking about the gory details of our disastrous first quarter.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
So let's look at the phrase gory details.

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
All right, so gory details.

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Gory details.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,360
This sounds kind of strange, gory details.

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
It seems very scary.

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,760
Well, the word gory comes from gore, like blood and guts, right?

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Exactly.

68
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,440
That's why it sounds a little bit scary to me.

69
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:15,480
So gory details mean all the little details of a negative or shocking or bad situation.

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,760
Okay, so the gory details of the meeting, so all the nasty negative stuff.

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,920
Or the gory detail, or you could say the newspaper reported all the gory details of the murder.

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay, very good.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
So gory details.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,120
So the employee was talking about how bad the company was doing and he mentioned this

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,840
word redundancies.

76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,680
Redundancies.

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,720
They are considering redundancies.

78
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,800
Okay, so redundancies, again, it's based on the word to be redundant.

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,040
All right, and that means?

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
To not be needed anymore.

81
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Okay, so redundancies are basically firing people.

82
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,000
It's well, laying people off, people that you don't need anymore.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
They are redundancies.

84
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,280
All right, so this is actually a British term, redundancies, to become redundant, because

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,640
in American English, you would just say layoffs.

86
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Yep.

87
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Okay, very good.

88
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
All right, so moving on.

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,120
They were talking about redundancies and maybe they should or shouldn't lay some people off,

90
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,360
but one of the problems were the regulations governing compensation packages.

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,640
Okay, so regulations governing compensation packages.

92
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,920
Regulations governing something.

93
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,840
So we have a noun governing noun.

94
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
What does that mean?

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,720
All right, so I think it would help us to understand this a little better if we listen

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,240
to some examples of this pattern, noun governing noun.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Example one.

98
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't agree with the regulations governing income taxes.

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,400
People shouldn't have to give away their hard-earned money.

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,080
Example two.

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
We need to protect the environment.

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,400
Therefore, there will be new policies governing corporate levels of pollution starting next

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,600
month.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,960
Example three.

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,680
The lack of regulations governing city transportation has led to many traffic accidents.

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay, great examples.

107
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,960
And well, before we move on, this compensation packages, I guess it's all the things that

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,760
the company gives you when they lay you off, right?

109
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Right, maybe a certain portion of your retirement benefits or...

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Like a month's pay, etc.

111
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, compensation packages.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,480
All right, so moving on to our next item on Language Takeaway, we have to shoulder the

113
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
cost.

114
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,080
To shoulder the cost.

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,280
All right, so if I shoulder something...

116
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,640
You have to carry it.

117
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
I carry it.

118
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Yeah, that's a good one.

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,640
So basically, it's the same as the shoulder, your body.

120
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,400
So you carry this cost or you carry this responsibility.

121
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,680
So you might also hear shoulder the burden.

122
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
To shoulder the burden.

123
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,800
So it just means to carry the responsibility.

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay, to share it.

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Yeah.

126
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,480
All right, interesting.

127
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,200
And we have one more word on Language Takeaway.

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,160
And the factory has gone under.

129
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
To go under.

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,400
All right, to go under.

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,200
When something goes under, a company goes under, it goes bankrupt.

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It goes bankrupt.

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,560
So it's not working anymore.

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
That's right.

135
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,320
All right, so to go under.

136
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Great vocabulary items here on Language Takeaway today.

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,640
It's time for us to move on to the next segment of our show where we're going to look at some

138
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
phrases.

139
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,040
So let's start now with Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,560
All right, so we've got some phrases that you can use when somebody is going to tell

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,840
you some bad news, but also some phrases you can use to deliver bad news.

143
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
All right, so let's start with our first phrase.

144
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,240
So the boss is getting ready to prepare for this bad news and he says, lay it on me.

145
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,720
He's like, okay, lay it on me.

146
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,080
Lay it on me.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,440
So if I say this, lay it on me, I'm just saying, tell me.

148
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Exactly.

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
So give me the bad news.

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,040
All right, so lay it on me.

151
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Very informal though.

152
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Yeah, you're right.

153
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
It is kind of informal.

154
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,080
But our next phrase, the boss is hearing about all this bad news and he says, for crying

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,560
out loud.

156
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,040
For crying out loud.

157
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,520
For crying out loud.

158
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,840
All right, so this is a very common phrase of frustration.

159
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,040
So why don't we listen to some examples to kind of understand how we use this phrase.

160
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,960
Example one.

161
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,440
For crying out loud, when I tell you to have the report done by Wednesday, that means I

162
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,360
expect it to be on my desk by the end of the day.

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,720
Example two.

164
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,080
We've got to figure out a new marketing strategy for crying out loud.

165
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,680
Example three.

166
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,760
For crying out loud, you just got your driving license and you already got in an accident.

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,260
So it kind of reminds me of, oh my God.

168
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,360
So you're frustrated, you're just saying this phrase as, oh my God, or something like this.

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,040
Yeah, it's like, oh, this is so annoying.

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Exactly.

171
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
For crying out loud.

172
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Yep.

173
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,680
All right, moving on to our third phrase.

174
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
How can I put this?

175
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
How can I put this?

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,480
So the boss asked him a direct question and he said, well, how can I put this?

177
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,920
So we use this phrase, we want to say something maybe a little bit more indirectly.

178
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,640
Right, so you're looking for words of how you can make it softer or more polite.

179
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Maybe the truth or what you're about to say is a little bit strong, so you want to soften

180
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
it up a bit.

181
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Yeah.

182
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,560
Okay, so you say, how can I put this?

183
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,120
But then you have to complement it with, let's just say that.

184
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Let's just say that.

185
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's just say that.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
So how do we use this phrase?

187
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,800
So for example, somebody asks me, well, what do you mean?

188
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,320
Why can't you come on vacation with us?

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,160
And I would say, how can I put this?

190
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,480
Let's just say that in nine months you will hear the pitter patter of little feet.

191
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
Okay, so your girlfriend's pregnant.

192
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Exactly.

193
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,720
So you're not saying, my girlfriend is pregnant.

194
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
You're giving like a metaphor.

195
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,040
A metaphor of what's going on, but you don't want to say it directly.

196
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Yeah.

197
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,760
So for example, I might say, let's just say that Michael isn't doing a great job.

198
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
All right.

199
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,720
So maybe there are very strong reasons or he's doing very, very poorly.

200
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Right.

201
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,160
But I'm just sort of not saying it exactly directly that he's doing bad.

202
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
Okay, very good.

203
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,760
So it's a phrase that you can actually use a lot and to be a little bit more polite or

204
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,640
a little bit more indirect when you're giving somebody some bad news.

205
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Exactly.

206
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,280
So we have two nice sort of complimenting phrases for delivering bad news and why don't

207
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:52,400
we hear them one more time in the dialogue.

208
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,200
Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give

209
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
us some good news.

210
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,680
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

211
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,280
Well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

212
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
What?

213
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,680
Don't tell me you only have bad news.

214
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,080
Well, sir, our sales have dropped.

215
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,160
No plunged 50% in the past month alone.

216
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,480
We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
of our staff.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,720
If we consider redundancies, it costs us a fortune because of the new regulations governing

220
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,240
compensation packages.

221
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
It's a real mess.

222
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,440
You're coming out loud.

223
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,680
How fast are we losing money?

224
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,240
How can I put this?

225
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,280
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter 11 in less than three

226
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
months.

227
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
What?

228
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,720
Jeez, how could this have happened?

229
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,040
So what's the bad news?

230
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, that's the really bad news.

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,520
Our suppliers suffered QC problems and well, half of our production is faulty.

232
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,800
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part, we're

233
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,400
going to have to shoulder this cost.

234
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,280
Are you joking?

235
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,120
Get the supplier on the line now.

236
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

237
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,680
We tried that, sir.

238
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,280
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

239
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,480
We're doomed.

240
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,040
There's some really good news though.

241
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Really?

242
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
What?

243
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I got offered a new job.

244
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,320
All right, great.

245
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,760
So this topic of filing for Chapter 11 is actually very recent, very common now because

246
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,880
recently one of the biggest companies filed for Chapter 11 in the US.

247
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Yeah, that's right.

248
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,720
But I often get confused by the phrase to file for Chapter 11 versus to file for Chapter

249
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
13.

250
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,880
All right, so in the United States, the bankruptcy law has different chapters or different sections,

251
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
right?

252
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,160
And Chapter 11 is basically for companies that run out of money, that go bankrupt, so

253
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,360
they have to declare themselves in bankruptcy and so they file for Chapter 11.

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,080
But what about Chapter 13?

255
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,800
Chapter 13 is for people.

256
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,520
So people who have large debts, maybe with the car company or the telephone company and

257
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,160
they can't pay, they file for Chapter 13.

258
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,120
They say, hey, I don't have money, I can't pay.

259
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,400
So I guess here it's kind of a metaphor again.

260
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,480
This phrase to file for Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 meaning bankruptcy.

261
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,760
And people will say personally that they're filing for Chapter 11.

262
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Exactly.

263
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,080
Right, so this is an interesting situation because if you file for bankruptcy in some

264
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,480
countries, you can go to jail.

265
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,560
I read recently about this happening in Dubai actually.

266
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Exactly.

267
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,280
So there is prison for debts.

268
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,040
In the US, you don't go to prison for debts.

269
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,640
But what about in your country's listeners?

270
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,440
What happens when you go into debt in your country?

271
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,640
Or what happens when a company goes into bankruptcy?

272
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
