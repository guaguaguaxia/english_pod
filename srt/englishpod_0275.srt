00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson about things that

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,960
you buy for your kitchen.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
That's right.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,320
Today we are going to buy a lot of machines and devices for our kitchen.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,220
So let's jump into the dialogue.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:28,280
Let's see what we are buying and we'll be back in a bit.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,240
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven't finished

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,400
getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
What are you getting?

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,720
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,880
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
Yeah, I know.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,320
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,800
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven,

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,040
dishwasher and trash compactor.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,440
That's a good idea.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,960
The kitchen will look amazing.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,560
All right, we're back.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,760
So now let's take a look at some of those strange machines on Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,520
Okay, so the kinds of machines you buy for your kitchen are called kitchen appliances.

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,720
Okay, so the word appliance, an appliance is basically a machine or device that is

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,400
used for the home, right?

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
That's right.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
So there are many different kinds of appliances.

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
You can usually plug these in.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,920
They usually need electricity to work.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,200
But the ones we're talking about today are special.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
They're for the kitchen.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,440
So that's why we call them kitchen appliances.

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
That's right.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Okay, very good.

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,520
So the kitchen appliances that we are looking at or we're trying to buy is, well, the first

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,400
one we have is a blender.

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,920
A blender.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,320
So a blender is a kitchen appliance that you use normally to make drinks.

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,400
So this is a glass jar that is, that's usually on the top of a little machine.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,480
Now when you put in, for example, some ice and some tea and some lemonade and you can

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
mix it up and you have this special mixed drink.

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,000
So it's called a blender.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,240
So as you mentioned, it's usually used to make some sort of juice or drink.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,000
But we also are getting a juicer which is specifically to make juices.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Now what is the difference between a blender and a juicer?

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,140
Well a blender is a machine that turns the things inside it around.

51
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,720
So it mixes them together.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,000
But a juicer is different because a juicer will actually take the juice from the fruit.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,280
So for example, if I have an orange and I cut the orange in half, I put that half on

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,760
the juicer and it turns around so that the juice will come down.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
Because otherwise I have to use my hands to squeeze it and that takes time.

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,960
So this is an electronic appliance that helps me get the juice from my fruits.

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
That's right.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Okay.

59
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,400
So we have a juicer to make juice, a blender to make different drinks and now to make coffee

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,560
we have a very simple machine, a coffee maker.

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,600
Okay so a coffee maker is just a simple machine that you put water and coffee into and it

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,160
will make the coffee for you.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Usually it's called a drip coffee maker because the coffee drip, drip, drip, drips down.

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,160
But there are many different kinds of coffee makers.

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Okay.

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,320
Now this next appliance can be a little bit confusing because now this one is called a

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,560
mixer.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,720
So what is the difference between a blender, a juicer and now we have a mixer?

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,800
Well there are different kinds of mixers actually but usually the kind of mixer that we are

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,440
referring to, that we're talking about is one that is electronic and it looks like it

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,920
has these two funny spoons on the end.

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,160
And when you turn the mixer on, you put it into a bowl and you mix the things in the

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
bowl.

74
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,880
So for example, if I want to make pancakes, I put some flour and some water and some eggs

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,120
into a bowl.

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,000
And I could stir it with my hand, with my spoon, but it's very tiring.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,720
So there's a mixer that's electronic to turn those ingredients around on its own.

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
That's right.

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
So it's quicker and obviously you don't get as tired.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Very good.

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,160
So I think we should take a break.

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
Let's go back to our dialogue.

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,880
Let's check out some more appliances and we'll be back to talk about the rest of them.

84
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:47,920
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven't finished

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,080
getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

86
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
What are you getting?

87
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,400
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,580
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

89
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,920
I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,440
Yeah, I know.

92
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,000
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,480
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,600
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven,

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,720
dishwasher and trash compactor.

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
That's a good idea.

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:31,000
The kitchen will look amazing.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, we're back.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Now, let's take a look at more kitchen appliances on Language Takeaway Part 2.

100
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
Language Takeaway.

101
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,760
Well, this first item, this first appliance is something that I know a lot of people all

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,500
over the world are familiar with.

103
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,800
It's called a rice cooker.

104
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,320
Now, a rice cooker, as the name says, it is used to cook rice but it does it in a very

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,600
simple and automatic way.

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
That's right.

107
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,240
You put the rice in the water in the rice cooker and you turn it on to, what, 20 minutes

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,040
and then later, 20 minutes later, it's already cooked.

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
It's done.

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Done.

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Easy.

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Right.

113
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,240
It's actually very convenient and very simple to make.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,080
Now, along with a rice cooker, sometimes we also get a steamer.

115
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Okay.

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,920
So a steamer is something that we normally use with vegetables or in Asia, a lot of times

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,680
we use it with dumplings, these little foods that are stuffed.

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,440
And so, a steamer is something that you use to cook a food but with the steam from hot

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
water.

120
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
That's right.

121
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,880
You don't put the food in the water, you don't fry the food, but you use the steam, that

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,680
hot air, to cook the food inside.

123
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
That's right.

124
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,480
So it's actually considered to be some of the, one of the healthiest ways of cooking

125
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,680
food because it's not as oily.

126
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
That's right.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Okay.

128
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Now, an interesting appliance that is actually not very popular in any other place except,

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
I think, North America, is a trash compactor.

130
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Okay.

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,440
So, trash means garbage.

132
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,240
It's the things that you want to throw away that you won't use anymore.

133
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,840
And a compactor is something that actually takes the trash and it makes it very small.

134
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Okay.

135
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Compact means small.

136
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
And so, a trash compactor is like a special garbage bin.

137
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,080
You put your garbage in it and you close it and you say, compact, and then it makes a

138
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
loud noise.

139
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,640
That's right.

140
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,240
And then when you pull it out, you open it up, the trash is very, very small.

141
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Very small.

142
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,040
So it's very easy to throw away.

143
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,040
So as we said, I've never actually seen this appliance in any other country except the

144
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
United States and Canada.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,240
I don't think I have either, but it's pretty popular in American homes because it helps

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,040
save space and it's very easy to throw things away that way.

147
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Yeah, that's right.

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,000
You can make a little bundle of trash and it's much easier than throwing a big bag of

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
trash away.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Exactly.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,820
And well, we're doing all this because we are kind of refurnishing the kitchen.

153
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,020
We are giving it new furniture.

154
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
That's right.

155
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,020
So we want to change the appearance.

156
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,360
And to do this, we will refurnish.

157
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,140
So to furnish something means to put furniture in it to make it look nice.

158
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,400
To refurnish means to change the furniture because we already have some, but we don't

159
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
like it.

160
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
That's right.

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
And so you can do this with your whole house.

162
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
That's right.

163
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,640
So maybe you throw away the old couch and the table and the kitchen cabinets and you

164
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
put a new one.

165
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,000
So you are refurnishing your home, refurnishing the kitchen.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's right.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
To refurnish.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
So a lot of great vocab here.

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,000
I think this is very useful for the kitchen, especially if sometimes you don't really know

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,980
what appliance you need to buy or what the instructions of a recipe say.

172
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:51,520
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

173
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,480
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven't finished

174
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,640
getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

175
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
What are you getting?

176
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,960
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

177
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,140
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

178
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

179
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,440
I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.

180
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, I know.

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,560
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

182
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,060
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

183
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven,

184
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,280
dishwasher and trash compactor.

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,700
That's a good idea.

186
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,000
The kitchen will look amazing.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,520
All right, we're back.

188
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,040
Now another appliance that I think is also not very popular in other countries, apart

189
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,400
from the trash compactor, we saw in the dialogue a dishwasher.

190
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,720
A dishwasher, that's right.

191
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,080
So this is something that you find in many American homes.

192
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,640
So why do you think trash compactors and dishwashers are not so popular in other places?

193
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm not sure.

194
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,800
It's possible it's because they're not very energy efficient.

195
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm not really sure.

196
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,240
I never had a trash compactor in my home in America, but we always had a dishwasher and

197
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,520
a dishwasher.

198
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,840
This was very, very nice to have because you don't have to wash the dishes by yourself.

199
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,280
You put them in the machine and the machine washes them.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,520
But you have to do some work before you put the dishes in the dishwasher, right?

201
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,560
You have to put them in the sink and water for a while and then you take them out and

202
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,120
then you put it in the dishwasher, right?

203
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,920
No, what we usually did is if there was food on the plate, we'd take the food and we'd

204
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,400
put it in the trash.

205
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,320
And if it's, you know, sometimes you leave the plate for like a day or two and it's very

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,240
dirty, you put some water on it because otherwise it will be hard and it will never come off.

207
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,080
But if it's recently used, you put all the plates, all of the cups, all of the knives

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,400
and forks into the dishwasher and it uses hot water and some soap and it will wash those

209
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
dishes in about 30 minutes.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,880
So how well does it wash?

211
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,840
It washes very, very well.

212
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,920
Some work better than others, but of course, if you have food that's two days old on a

213
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,960
plate, then it won't wash very well.

214
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,920
I think it also has to do with the type of instruments that people use around the world

215
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
to cook.

216
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,200
For example, big pots.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
I don't think you can put pots in the dishwasher, right?

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
No, you can't.

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,160
You could not put a wok in the dishwasher.

220
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,080
But I think it also has to do with the fact that dishwashers are very big.

221
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,600
And if you have a small apartment or like me, a very small kitchen, it's impossible

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
to make room for a dishwasher.

223
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,840
But it seems like a very convenient thing.

224
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,440
And of course, there are so many other kitchen appliances that, well, if we started to mention

225
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,240
all of them, we would run out of time.

226
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,640
But if you have any questions or any comments about this lesson or you have maybe some other

227
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,120
kitchen appliances, you can come to our website EnglishPod.com and leave those there.

228
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,440
We hope to see you at EnglishPod and until next time.

229
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Bye.

230
00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:04,380
Good.
