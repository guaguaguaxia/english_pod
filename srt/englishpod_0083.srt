00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,640
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,800
And today we're going to be getting money.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
That's right.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,040
We're going to have a lesson about the ATM.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,240
The ATM or?

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Automatic Teller Machine.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,400
Okay, that's what it stands for, ATM.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,160
So we're going to be looking at the language that you'll probably find in an ATM maybe

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,460
in the United States or in English speaking country.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,460
That's right.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,560
But before we begin, why don't we look at some vocabulary that we'll hear in the dialogue.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,220
Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:43,640
As we mentioned, the ATM or Automatic Teller Machine is a machine where you get your money,

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
right?

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Exactly.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,200
And also, well, some people are in different places, they may call it the bank machine.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
Yeah, or maybe the cash machine.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,280
Or just a money machine or something.

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
All right.

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
So ATM.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
ATM.

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,280
And now let's take a look at our next word.

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
Local Authorities.

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,080
The Local Authorities.

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,560
The Local Authorities.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,480
So what are the Local Authorities?

29
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,360
Well, basically, it's the police.

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
The police.

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,560
Why do you say local authorities?

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,680
Okay, well, authority is the person in charge, right?

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,960
The boss.

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,080
So the local authorities are basically the people who are the boss of this place.

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
In that area.

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Yeah.

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
So the police.

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
The local authorities.

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,020
So why don't we start now with our dialogue?

40
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,240
Why are we talking about local authorities and ATM machines?

41
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
I don't know.

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:46,080
We got to listen to find out.

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,560
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,800
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,040
Hello, welcome to Universal Bank.

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,920
Please insert your card into the slot.

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
I know where to put my card.

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,160
Please input your six digit PIN code followed by the pound key.

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Thank you.

51
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,840
Please select an option.

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Thank you.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,080
You have selected withdraw.

54
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected.

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
Just give me my money.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,060
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

57
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,060
Thank you.

58
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,060
You want to transfer.

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,840
10,000 US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,760
If this is correct, please press one.

61
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,520
No, no, stupid machine.

62
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
What are you doing?

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
No.

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Confirmed.

65
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,140
Thank you for using our bank.

66
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,960
Please remove your card from the slot.

67
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Goodbye.

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
No way.

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
What happened?

70
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Give me my money.

71
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Danger.

72
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Danger.

73
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,320
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
arrive.

75
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you for using our bank.

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Have a nice day.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So it's not his day today.

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,320
I think he was very unlucky and maybe he's going to be in trouble.

81
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
I know.

82
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
And he was on a date.

83
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,440
This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to a guy when he's on a date.

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
All right.

85
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Yeah.

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,880
So well, we saw some of the language that was related to an ATM, money and banking.

87
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,240
So why don't we take a look at that now in Language Takeaway.

88
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Language Takeaway.

89
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,120
All right.

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,840
So the guy had to insert his card into the slot.

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Okay.

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
So slot.

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Slot.

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
All right.

95
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Slot.

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
And that is an opening, right?

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
Or a type of hole maybe.

98
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah.

99
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
It's a hole that is usually long.

100
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,320
Long and it's like a rectangular hole.

101
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Yeah.

102
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,560
A slot is never a circle.

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Okay.

104
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,560
So for example, when you get mail, the mailman will put it into your mailbox through the

105
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
slot.

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
That's right.

107
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay.

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,760
And now that he put his card into the slot, he had to input a six digit pin code.

109
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,840
Want to just do both together?

110
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Digit and pin code?

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Yeah.

112
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Okay.

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
So a six digit pin code.

114
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
All right.

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,400
Now we have two words here that are new.

116
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Digit.

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
Digit is basically a number between zero and nine.

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Okay.

119
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,840
So any number between zero and nine is considered a digit.

120
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Yes.

121
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,720
So 100 is made up of three digits.

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Three digits.

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Okay.

124
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,080
And what about pin code?

125
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,240
A pin code is your secret number that you use to take money out.

126
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,960
Now why wouldn't we say password?

127
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,360
Password is usually letters.

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay.

129
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,840
And pin code is numbers.

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Exactly.

131
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
All right.

132
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,960
He had to input his six digit pin code and then after that, he had to press the pound

133
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,120
key.

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Pound key.

135
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Now this is strange.

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
A pound key.

137
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
What is that?

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,440
Well, you know on a phone, on the bottom right, there's a key or a button that looks like

139
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,720
a number sign.

140
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Number sign.

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
So kind of like two vertical lines and two horizontal lines.

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Yeah.

143
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
Two lines going up and down, two lines going across.

144
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay.

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
So that's called the pound key.

146
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
All right.

147
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
What about the other one?

148
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
It's called the star.

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
The star.

150
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Star key.

151
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
The star key.

152
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
So he's got the pin code after the pound key.

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,760
Now he's ready to withdraw money.

154
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,320
So we heard withdraw.

155
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Okay.

156
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
So withdraw is?

157
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Is a noun.

158
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,520
It's the action of taking money out.

159
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Okay.

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
A withdrawal.

161
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
A withdrawal.

162
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Okay.

163
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,840
And to withdraw.

164
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,740
To withdraw is just the verb.

165
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,080
To take out money, right?

166
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Exactly.

167
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
So we have the noun and the verb.

168
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,760
The only difference is an L at the end.

169
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes.

170
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,400
So withdraw noun and withdraw verb.

171
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
Okay.

172
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,640
And well, he wanted to withdraw money, but something happened with the ATM and it turned

173
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,000
out that he was going to transfer money.

174
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So transfer.

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Transfer.

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Transfer.

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,360
When you transfer money, you take it from one place and put it in another.

178
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Okay.

179
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,160
And usually in banking, when you transfer money, you don't really see it, right?

180
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Exactly.

181
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
It's all electronic.

182
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,280
So you just put it from one bank account to another, but you never actually see this money.

183
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Exactly.

184
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
So you transfer money.

185
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Transfer.

186
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,680
And now this one also has a verb and a noun, right?

187
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Right.

188
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
A transfer.

189
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
And to transfer.

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Same word.

191
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Yep.

192
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Easy.

193
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
All right.

194
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time.

195
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
It's going to be slowed down a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some

196
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:37,680
phrases.

197
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

198
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,760
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

199
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,040
Hello.

200
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
Welcome to Universal Bank.

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
Please insert your card into the slot.

202
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I know where to put my card.

203
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,100
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

204
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,480
Please input your six digit PIN code followed by the pound key.

205
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Thank you.

206
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Please select an option.

207
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
Thank you.

208
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,680
You have selected withdraw.

209
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,440
I know what I selected.

211
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,000
Just give me my money.

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

213
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Thank you.

214
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
You want to transfer.

215
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
$10,000.

216
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Two.

217
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,080
The World Wildlife Foundation.

218
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,160
If this is correct, please press one.

219
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
No, no.

220
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Stupid machine, what are you doing?

221
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
No.

222
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Confirmed.

223
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,800
Thank you for using our bank.

224
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
Please remove your card from the slot.

225
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Goodbye.

226
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
No way.

227
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
What happened?

228
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Give me my money.

229
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Danger.

230
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Danger.

231
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,840
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities

232
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
arrive.

233
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,680
Thank you for using our bank.

234
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Have a nice day.

235
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
No.

236
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:54,600
Okay, so that was a little easier to understand.

237
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,440
But Marco, there's some interesting phrases here, some instructions that you commonly

238
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
read or hear when you're using a bank machine.

239
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,120
So why don't we take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

240
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Fluency Builder.

241
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,200
Well, the bank machine told this guy to insert your card.

242
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Insert your card.

243
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Insert your card.

244
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,520
So this verb, to insert, to place inside.

245
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Exactly.

246
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
So what else can we insert?

247
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,280
Well, for example, commonly you insert a disc.

248
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah, in your computer.

249
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
In your computer, right?

250
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Yep.

251
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Or you insert a CD into your CD player.

252
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,160
Or DVD into your DVD player.

253
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Yep.

254
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
All right.

255
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,720
So to insert something, to put inside.

256
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Yes.

257
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,800
So he had to insert his card into the slot.

258
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,240
And then the bank machine asked him to select an option.

259
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
Select an option.

260
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Select an option.

261
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,120
Now this is a very common phrase that you will not only see in ATMs, but basically everywhere,

262
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
right?

263
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,920
On computers or the internet or many, many things where you're dealing with machines.

264
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,840
So it's an order that says, well, select one of these choices that you have.

265
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Make a choice.

266
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Make a choice.

267
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Yeah.

268
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Select an option.

269
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
All right.

270
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,720
So two simple phrases, but very useful and also very high frequency, right?

271
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Yeah.

272
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
And you know what?

273
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
When you use phrases like these two, it sounds quite professional, doesn't it?

274
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Yeah.

275
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
A little bit formal.

276
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Okay.

277
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,400
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and

278
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:40,480
talk a little bit more.

279
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,960
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

280
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

281
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Hello.

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,440
Welcome to Universal Bank.

283
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,160
Please insert your card into the slot.

284
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,100
I know where to put my card.

285
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,400
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

286
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,560
Please input your six digit PIN code followed by the pound key.

287
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Thank you.

288
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,240
Please select an option.

289
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Thank you.

290
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
You have selected withdraw.

291
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
I know what I selected.

293
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
Just give me my money.

294
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,440
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

295
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Thank you.

296
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,200
You want to transfer $10,000 to the World Wildlife Foundation.

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
If this is correct, please press one.

298
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
No, no.

299
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Stupid machine.

300
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
What are you doing?

301
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
No.

302
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Confirmed.

303
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Thank you for using our bank.

304
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Please remove your card from the slot.

305
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Goodbye.

306
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
No way.

307
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
What happened?

308
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Give me my money.

309
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Danger.

310
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Danger.

311
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,720
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
arrive.

313
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,360
Thank you for using our bank.

314
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Have a nice day.

315
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
No.

316
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,040
All right, Erica, so what about you?

317
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,720
Have you ever had any problems with the ATM?

318
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,800
I've had more problems than I can count.

319
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
What happened?

320
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,880
Well, I think in the last two years, I've probably lost about seven bank cards in an

321
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
ATM.

322
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Really?

323
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
You forget it in the slot?

324
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Yes.

325
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,400
I leave it in the slot and then walk away from the bank machine and no bank cards.

326
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,680
Well, I think now the ATMs, because this is a common problem, now they have like a little

327
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,040
alarm that when you take out your money and everything, it just starts beeping and beeping

328
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
until you take out your card.

329
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Yes.

330
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,160
And I like the bank machines that actually give you your card first and then give you

331
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
your money.

332
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,600
Because if they give me my money first, that's all I want, right?

333
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
So I run away with my money and leave my card in the bank machine.

334
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Right.

335
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I think that's a good idea.

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
I've never seen it before, though.

337
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,000
In Switzerland, they have them like that.

338
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
In Switzerland.

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
And I think it's the ATMs that you only have to swipe your card.

340
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Oh, yeah.

341
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,240
I've done that as well and also ruined a bank card with that.

342
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,880
I swiped it too many times, put in the wrong pin code and...

343
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
It blocks your card.

344
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Yeah.

345
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Terrible.

346
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Well, what about you guys?

347
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm sure everyone has some experience or some inconvenience with ATM machines.

348
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,760
So why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it?

349
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,040
You can also find lots more resources on our website to help you learn English.

350
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,520
So check it out.

351
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,440
And until next time, goodbye!
