00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,520
My name is Catherine and today we have a very technical, very advanced lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,160
This is all about one of my favorite subjects.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
That's right.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,240
We're going to talk about music, but specifically we're going to talk about the piano and learning

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
how to play the piano.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,160
So we're going to talk about very specific vocab related to this instrument.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Right.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
So piano and playing music, not listening to music.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Right.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,320
And there are a lot of interesting words and phrases here.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
Some of them actually come from foreign languages like Italian.

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
So listen up.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,640
We'll be back in a moment.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,200
And when we come back, we'll be talking about what these words and phrases mean.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,600
Hi Cody.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,320
How did practicing go this week?

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Well, I had several tests and an oral presentation this week, so I didn't get a chance to memorize

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,160
the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Great.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,240
Let's start with some scales and arpeggios first.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Good, good.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,440
This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the 16th

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
notes.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,240
Now let's take a look at this tricky section.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,680
Charlene, before I start, I was wondering if it was okay if I put a small crescendo

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,400
in here and then a decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Hmm, it might work.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
I'll have to hear it.

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:42,920
Show me what you've done.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Not bad.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
It was horrible.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,400
I played it much better at home.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,120
It's just nerves.

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,080
Just play the right hand for now.

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,840
One, two, three, four, five, six, ta, ti, triple e, ti.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,160
Good, good.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,960
Don't forget the accidentals.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,160
The key signature says that note should be a G sharp, but now it's a G natural.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,800
Now add the bass clef.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,760
You're going too fast.

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,160
Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.

44
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Is that better?

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Yes, much better.

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,720
What was that?

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Sorry.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,240
The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
That's okay.

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Keep going.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,600
You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds.

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Watch your dynamics.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
Keep your elbows lifted.

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,320
Remember to stroke the keys.

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,920
Don't pound.

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,600
That's better.

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,440
Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
from the pack just as much or as more so as your musicianship.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,400
All right, we're back.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,320
You probably noticed that there are a lot of ways to describe certain aspects of playing

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
the piano.

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
They talked about scales and all that stuff.

64
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,960
Why don't we take a deeper look at this vocab in Language Takeaway Part 1.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,200
Language Takeaway.

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,520
The first part of the lesson is the warm-up.

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,040
That's when we start to get our fingers moving and really stretch out.

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,600
This is an important part of any musician's routine because it's also a way to practice

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,800
some very basic, very fundamental things.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,520
The first of which is a scale.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Okay.

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,720
So actually, Cody started warming up with some scales.

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,080
So what exactly are scales?

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,560
Well, basically, there are different musical notes.

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,600
Some people know them as do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do.

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,920
Some people call them C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. But each of those and many others have

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
scales.

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
So that's eight notes together.

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Okay.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,720
So basically, when you're playing scales, you're just playing a sequence of these eight

81
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
notes.

82
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Right.

83
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Going up or down.

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Okay.

85
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
To warm up.

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
And what about an arpeggio?

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
I think this is Italian, right?

88
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Definitely.

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,480
Arpeggio is another kind of warm-up where you're not playing every single note.

90
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,320
You're playing some notes in a scale.

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
All right.

92
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,760
So, la, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
That's an arpeggio.

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Okay.

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Very good.

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,520
So, and as you said, these are usually for warm-ups, right?

97
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Yeah.

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,880
They're also very important because they come into play later when you're talking about

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
the key that a song or a piece of music is in.

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
So this helps you memorize the key that some music is in.

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Okay.

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Very good.

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,960
So I think related to this is the rhythm of the piece that you're playing.

104
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
That's right.

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
So rhythm is really important.

106
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,600
You can even say, you know, he's got rhythm or they have rhythm.

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
It's a way to describe the beat of a kind of music.

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,840
So sometimes it has to do with how fast or how slow something is.

109
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,240
Other times it has to do with the way that the notes work together.

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,320
For example, a steady beat would be one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

111
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
This is a complicated beat.

112
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,560
It goes ta, ti, tri, po, li, ta, ti, tri, po, li.

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,680
So this is a very difficult kind of rhythm.

114
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Okay.

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,120
So the rhythm is just kind of, it gives you how fast, how slow it is.

116
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,840
And I guess if you can take a look at notes and you can play it in many different rhythms,

117
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,920
but not necessarily they're going to sound correct.

118
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Right.

119
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,960
And actually it's interesting.

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,360
In English we also have a group of instruments that are called rhythm instruments.

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,640
So this would be like the drums.

122
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Okay.

123
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
So it gives the beat.

124
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Yes.

125
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Very good.

126
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,880
And well, moving on, I think some other Italian words popped up in here when they talked about

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
crescendo and decrescendo.

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Right.

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,440
So crescendo is when something becomes louder.

130
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,840
So I can make a crescendo.

131
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,800
But a decrescendo, de in Italian, just like in English means it's the opposite.

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
So it means it's getting really softer.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And what about pianissimo?

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
Pianissimo is basically an indication.

136
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,760
It also comes from Italian.

137
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,560
It's an indication that a player, a musician should play something very, very, very quietly.

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
It's almost like a whisper.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,800
So all these three words have to do with the volume of or how loud or not so loud you play

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
the instrument.

142
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
That's right.

143
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Okay.

144
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Very good.

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,840
And well, moving on now, we talk about accidentals.

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,200
Okay.

147
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
This is important.

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,920
Remember earlier we were talking about scales.

149
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Well, for example, the G scale has one sharp.

150
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,000
So that's an F sharp.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,760
So if I'm playing it on the piano, there are seven white keys and one black key.

152
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Okay.

153
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,520
So actually here they mentioned G sharp and then something like G natural.

154
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,240
All this, just like for everyone that's out there is complete Chinese to me.

155
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
I have no idea what this is all about.

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,200
So you have the accidentals and G sharp and you're describing something about sharpness

157
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
with accidentals.

158
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
That's right.

159
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,440
So basically if you look at a piano, you have white keys.

160
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,160
Those are natural.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,360
They don't have a sharp or a flat.

162
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,200
The sharps and flats are actually played on the black keys.

163
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,240
Usually it's a half step from a normal note.

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,960
So G, it's a half step.

165
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,200
We're talking about different keys.

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,360
So if something is in the key of G, all of you music people know what this is, key of

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,440
G, there's one accidental.

168
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
What's the accidental?

169
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,560
It's always F sharp.

170
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,960
And so an accidental means a sharp or a flat in that key.

171
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Okay.

172
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,320
So when we talk about sharps on the piano, they're basically the black keys.

173
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Yes.

174
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,040
Well, sharps and flats can both be black keys.

175
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Okay.

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Very good.

177
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,960
And well, apart from accidentals and G sharp, G natural, the teacher also talked about a

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,640
bass clef.

179
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Okay.

180
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,640
This is important for people who play lower instruments like the bass, you know, the upright

181
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,080
bass that big one or people who play the piano, obviously, this represents a way of writing

182
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,440
the lower notes.

183
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Okay.

184
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,240
So you see the lines, those five lines on paper and people write the notes.

185
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,720
Well, sometimes they're for higher instruments, you know, the flute or the trumpet.

186
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,440
But sometimes when they're for lower instruments, like the left hand of a piano or for the upright

187
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,440
bass, you have to write it in a special register, a special part of the sound kind of continuum.

188
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,960
And that's the treble.

189
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,080
That's the bass clef.

190
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Okay.

191
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,680
So basically, if anyone has ever seen piano notes, it tells you what to play with your

192
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,160
left hand and your right hand.

193
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,720
So I imagine the bass clef will be everything that's on your left hand because that sounds

194
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,520
like deeper, graver, right?

195
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Yeah, it's lower.

196
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,920
So it's lower on the scale instead of like up high up here where it's on the treble clef.

197
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
All right.

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,040
So, oh, so the opposite would be the treble clef.

199
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
That's right.

200
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
The treble clef is up higher.

201
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,080
It's most other instruments like the trumpet.

202
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
The bass clef is for lower instruments.

203
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,400
And that just means that the way that you read the music on the page is a little bit

204
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
different.

205
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,680
Okay, very good.

206
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,720
And well, we also got into things like tempo and the piece was described as andante.

207
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Andante.

208
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,840
This is a very Italian word.

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,240
Okay, so andante means that something is played slowly.

210
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Okay.

211
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,280
So apart from andante, if so, it's a style or a tempo.

212
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,480
I guess tempo is the speed of which is played, right?

213
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
That's right.

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
But you're right to say that it's also a style because in many symphonies, for example, there's

215
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,720
a movement, a part of the symphony that's called the andante.

216
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
And that's when everything starts to get slow and serious or pretty.

217
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,520
I've heard, I don't know, in piano, I've heard of something called staccato.

218
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,760
And I think this is also related to tempo, right?

219
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Staccato is the way that you play something.

220
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,280
So instead of having these long, pretty notes, you're playing them like this.

221
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
They're very, very sharp.

222
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Like a machine gun.

223
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,800
Okay, so but it's not related to the tempo.

224
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,400
It's kind of more just like the way that you press the keys.

225
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Exactly.

226
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
It's a style for playing.

227
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Okay.

228
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
All right.

229
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Well, the teacher also told the student to be careful where they lift the foot off the

230
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,080
pedal.

231
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,400
And the student said, I'm just so sorry.

232
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,120
The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

233
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,480
Okay, so an octave is really, really important in music.

234
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,600
Like we were talking about earlier with a scale, a scale is eight notes.

235
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:28,520
Well, the root, the place the word octave comes from is the number eight, like an octagon.

236
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,720
So octave means eight notes together, or like low C, high C, that's an octave.

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,200
So think about the piano, when you're putting your fingers on the keys, covering eight keys

238
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,680
means you have to stretch your thumb and your pinky out really, really far.

239
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,000
And so he's saying, sorry, it's hard for me to do this because the octave, that stretch

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,720
is really hard for my hand.

241
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Right.

242
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Okay.

243
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
So this is different from an eighth, right?

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Well, it depends.

245
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Are you talking about eighth note?

246
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I don't know.

247
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,760
Because I just came into the night because an octave is eight and an eighth note is different,

248
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
I imagine.

249
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Yeah.

250
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,840
Well, you heard in the dialogue, 16th note, eighth note.

251
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,360
That's actually talking about the length of a note, how long you hold it.

252
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Okay.

253
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,280
So basically you're saying it's the way you measure the music.

254
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,660
You can have four count or three count, but you divide that into pieces.

255
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,680
It's like a pie in math where you divide it into pieces.

256
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,080
So if it's a 16th note or an eighth note, that's the length based on the kind of music

257
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
you're playing.

258
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,920
So I imagine 16th note is shorter than eighth.

259
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Yes.

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Okay.

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
At least I got that one right.

262
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,760
And 32nd note is shorter than a 16th note.

263
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Wow.

264
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
You have all the way up to 32nd.

265
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
64th note is shorter.

266
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh, wow.

267
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Okay.

268
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
It gets very complicated, very mathy.

269
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
All right.

270
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,960
And towards the end, the teacher recommended for Cody to watch his dynamics.

271
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,720
What does she mean with watch your dynamics?

272
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,120
I used to get this all the time in music.

273
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,040
So you're concentrating on your music, you're playing, you're getting the notes and Cody

274
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,360
is stretching his hands.

275
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,560
The octaves are so far away and he forgets to play it loud or soft because on the page

276
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,300
it says like we heard earlier, decrescendo.

277
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,320
So get much, much softer.

278
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,680
So Cody completely forgot.

279
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
He's not listening.

280
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,240
He's not reading the page and seeing what it says about the volume of the music.

281
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,680
So basically the dynamics are like the instructions of how loud to play it or not so loud.

282
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Exactly.

283
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,120
So does it say pianissimo or the opposite?

284
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Does it say forte?

285
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
And it will actually say this on the notes.

286
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes.

287
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Forte, it'll say that.

288
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,080
F-O-R-T-E or sometimes just F.

289
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Oh, okay.

290
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,360
So P is piano.

291
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,280
That means like we said earlier, quiet.

292
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Pianissimo is P, P, P. It's very, very quiet.

293
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,560
F is forte, loud.

294
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Okay.

295
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,360
So I think, well, if anyone out there plays an instrument you can relate and you can maybe

296
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,680
know about these things that you may know it in your original language.

297
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,080
I know many people who play musical instruments and don't really know the technical words

298
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
in their original language.

299
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,440
I mean, things like Andante and pianissimo, things like this, I think are universal, right?

300
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,840
They're used in whatever language.

301
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Exactly.

302
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,960
Very, very widely used.

303
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,000
But things like the accidentals or bass clef or scales and stuff like that, I think it's

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,360
obviously different languages.

305
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,080
For example, you know Italian, like scales or accidentals, are they?

306
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
They're different.

307
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
They're different, right?

308
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
They're different.

309
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
All of the other words.

310
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,680
So the instructions on the page, because music is shared all over the world, the instructions

311
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,160
on the page are almost always in Italian, so piano, andante, or they're in German.

312
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Oh, really?

313
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Some music.

314
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,520
And everything else, scales, octaves, these are all in your native language.

315
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,720
And so they're very, very important to study if you want to play and I think very, very

316
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,440
useful if you want to study an instrument.

317
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Yeah, of course.

318
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
I think it's also a very good idea to just have a general knowledge about these things

319
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,160
because sometimes it's nice to know a little bit about it and maybe if a friend is talking

320
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,040
about music, you can maybe understand a little bit more about what it's like.

321
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,720
Or if you see music, a sheet of music, you can now more or less know what's going on

322
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,760
with all those drawings and little scribbles there.

323
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Absolutely.

324
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,000
And if you have any questions, of course, you're welcome to come to our website and

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,080
ask or share your experiences as Marco has just said.

326
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,200
So please come to EnglishPod.com.

327
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
We hope to see you there.

328
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
All right.

329
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
We'll see you guys next time.

330
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Bye.

331
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:39,960
Let's David!
