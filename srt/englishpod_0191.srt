00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,600
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about something that has always been very

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,400
confusing for me.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
For me as well.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,240
I don't understand very well what this is about.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,760
We're going to be talking about time zones and a little bit about daylight savings time.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Before we get started though, let's take a look at this phrase in today's vocabulary

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,000
preview.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,360
All right, so the phrase is daylight savings time.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,800
Okay, so we're trying to save daylight pretty much.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
That's right.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
So this is the time of year when we change our clocks.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,840
What does that mean?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
That means in the fall there's a special day and everyone has it on their calendar and

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
we change the clocks.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,840
We put them back one hour.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,400
So if it was eight o'clock now it's seven o'clock.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,800
Okay, so everything is earlier, starts earlier.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
And that's basically to take advantage of the daylight, right?

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,200
That's why it's called daylight savings time.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Exactly.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,960
And so that's for the winter and then when the winter's past we change the clocks again.

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,560
We have the spring daylight savings where we change our clocks ahead.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Okay.

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,360
So it sounds kind of complicated.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,760
Many countries don't have daylight savings time.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,000
They don't change their clocks at all.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
But we're going to be talking about this in a little bit more so why don't we listen to

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,920
our dialogue for the first time.

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
What?

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Why do we have to do that?

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,240
in the afternoon.

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,900
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the Earth.

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,680
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available we compensate by moving

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,320
our clocks forward one hour.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
I see.

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
That's convenient.

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,080
I never understood things like this such as GMT.

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,640
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,480
Here in California we're in Pacific Standard Time.

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,000
That is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Remember when we were in Beijing?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,160
Well, then we were in China Standard Time and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,000
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA because of the huge time difference.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,740
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived

51
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,040
in LA the same day at noon.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,880
It's like we went back in time.

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Alright we're back.

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,560
So that was a pretty clear explanation of why we do these things.

55
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,040
But maybe there are a couple of words that you didn't understand.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,480
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,080
Well, Marco, what you were hinting at before, this idea that we have shorter days in the

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,280
winter and longer days in the summer has to do with the rotation of the Earth.

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,200
So the rotation of the Earth is our first phrase.

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
So the Earth rotates.

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,760
What does that mean if it rotates?

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,480
Means to spin around.

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,440
But not just to spin around anywhere.

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,320
It means that if you draw a line through the middle of something, it never leaves that

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
line.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,920
It just kind of turns.

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,280
So it's spinning.

69
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,760
Like the wheels on a car.

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
They rotate.

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,380
That means they go around but they are fixed to the car.

72
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,760
So this is one of the reasons why we need to compensate our clocks because of the rotation

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
of the Earth.

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
And that's our next word, to compensate.

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,880
This is a verb, to compensate.

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,600
And it's often used with money but it can be used with time as well.

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,720
Time or sunlight.

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,760
So with money you'd say, I paid him a hundred dollars but I owed him a hundred fifty.

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,600
So I'm going to compensate him for the extra fifty.

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Means I'm going to fix it.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,360
So to compensate would be the verb and compensation would be the noun.

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,320
Now in this case we're talking about time.

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,040
So how can we compensate time?

84
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,720
Well that means that if we have lost an hour because we changed the clocks, we have to

85
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,880
compensate.

86
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,780
We have to try and gain that hour back.

87
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,880
And so that's why in the spring, after the days start to get longer and longer, we have

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,040
to compensate for that by changing the clocks again.

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
So we're compensating time.

90
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,440
Now related to daylight savings and this whole time thing is time zones.

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,280
We have time zones all over the Earth.

92
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,120
And you've probably noticed this if you've traveled.

93
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,640
You have to change your clocks or many times you see in hotels what time it is in London,

94
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,400
in Hong Kong, in Berlin, etc.

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,360
And this makes a lot of sense because like we said, the Earth is rotating and so if it's

96
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,600
daylight in Moscow and it's nighttime in New York, obviously it's not the same time.

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,560
So to compensate for this difference, we have different time zones.

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,280
And each time zone is pretty much an hour or so, you know, half an hour different from

99
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
the next one.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Right.

101
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
So most countries actually have different time zones throughout their country unless

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,160
they're small that they don't really need to compensate any change.

103
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,360
Or for example, China, just to unify everything, it's a big country but they have one time

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
zone.

105
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
It's China standard time.

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Exactly.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,280
But in the United States, we have four time zones.

108
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Right.

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Alright.

110
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
So that's time zone.

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
And the other thing related to time zone is time difference.

112
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,160
Okay, well think about math here.

113
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,000
Difference is a word that we use in math.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,920
And a time difference is the amount of time, that means how many hours there are between

115
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,520
one time zone and another time zone.

116
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,480
So for example, Beijing and New York City.

117
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,120
These are very, very far away from each other.

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,040
If it's day in New York, it's night in Beijing.

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,600
So that means if it's seven in the morning in Beijing, it's probably around seven at

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
night in New York.

121
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,880
So the time difference would be more or less 12 hours.

122
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Exactly.

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,840
But when it's daylight savings time, it's 13.

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
So be careful.

125
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Right.

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Okay.

127
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I think that's pretty clear.

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
I think we should go back and listen to our dialogue again.

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,520
And we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,200
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

131
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
What?

132
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Why do we have to do that?

133
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,520
Well, at the start of the spring, we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less

134
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,840
in the afternoon.

135
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,480
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth.

136
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,280
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
our clocks forward one hour.

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,920
I see.

139
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
That's convenient.

140
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,680
I never understood things like this, such as GMT.

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,240
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

142
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,520
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,060
Here in California, we're in Pacific Standard Time.

144
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,600
That is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Remember when we were in Beijing?

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

147
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,560
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA, because of the huge time difference.

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,320
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived

149
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,640
in LA the same day at noon.

150
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,160
It's like we went back in time.

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
All right, we're back.

152
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Now let's take a look at three key phrases in Fluency Builder.

153
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Fluency Builder.

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Let's go back to the beginning of this dialogue.

155
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,840
The person who's explaining all of these interesting things is saying that, well, in any case,

156
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,760
to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward

157
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,200
one hour.

158
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,840
This is an important phrase you could say to take better advantage of or to take advantage

159
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
of.

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Let's talk about this.

161
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,040
To take advantage of something.

162
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,400
So to take advantage of something is to use it efficiently, right?

163
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,880
Or to take better advantage.

164
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,120
So for example, if you drive to work every day and your neighbor drives to work every

165
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,640
day and you work at the same place, you could take better advantage of your car and the

166
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,200
cost by sharing the same car to work.

167
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,320
Exactly.

168
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,880
Or when people started to use computers, you could say, well, they were taking better advantage

169
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,040
of their time by speeding things up, by making things faster with the computers.

170
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Right.

171
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,760
Or many mothers say, take better advantage of your time and read something instead of

172
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,320
playing those video games.

173
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Exactly.

174
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,920
So it means, like you said, to be more efficient, to do useful or important things.

175
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
That's right.

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,600
And now when we talked about what daylight savings time means or GMT, what that stands

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
for.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
This is an interesting phrase.

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,400
It stands for.

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,680
Well, think about it as a picture.

181
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,720
So if something stands for something else, that means the original thing, it's not there

182
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
anymore.

183
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,440
And so in words and phrases like GMT, GMT doesn't mean anything by itself.

184
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,040
But the G stands for something, the M stands for something.

185
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
It's an acronym.

186
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay.

187
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,200
So this is an acronym that stands for, that represents three big long words.

188
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Okay.

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Greenwich, meantime.

190
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Right.

191
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,080
So we use this a lot when we are defining words or when we are defining an acronym like

192
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,800
GMT stands for Greenwich, meantime.

193
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,120
Or for example, USA stands for United States of America.

194
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Or we can even say someone's name stands for something.

195
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,520
So Marco, what is the M in your last name stand for?

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,400
So you're Marco M. What does the M stand for?

197
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Right.

198
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,760
And then I would say, well, it stands for Mejia.

199
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Your last name.

200
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Right.

201
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,080
And then we use this when you see things that you don't understand, maybe an acronym or

202
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
an abbreviation.

203
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,480
Like does Cathy stand for Catherine?

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes, Cathy stands for Catherine.

205
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
It's a short version of Catherine.

206
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Cool.

207
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
All right.

208
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,160
And well now talking a little bit more about time, you've maybe seen the movie Back to

209
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,440
the Future and this is what it's all about, to go back in time.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
To go back in time.

211
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,360
So we went back in time.

212
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,560
This is what the person says about the flight from Beijing to LA.

213
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,840
What's interesting is that to go back in time is kind of a fixed phrase.

214
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
We always say it like this.

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,080
So we could say, if you went back in time, where would you go?

216
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
What time?

217
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
What place?

218
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Right.

219
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,520
So to go back in time, you usually use it like this.

220
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,840
Now, what if I wanted to say to go into the future?

221
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Could you say, go forward in time?

222
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,080
You could go forward in time or you could go into the future.

223
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Right.

224
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Go into the future.

225
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,280
So remember, if you want to talk about going back in time, it's usually traveling to the

226
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
past.

227
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Exactly.

228
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
All right.

229
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
So that's all the phrases we have.

230
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:27,360
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time.

231
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,080
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

232
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
What?

233
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Why do we have to do that?

234
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,360
Well, at the start of the spring, we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less

235
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
in the afternoon.

236
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,320
This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth.

237
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,120
In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving

238
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,760
our clocks forward one hour.

239
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I see.

240
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
That's convenient.

241
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,520
I never understood things like this, such as GMT.

242
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,080
I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock.

243
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,360
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

244
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,900
Here in California, we're in Pacific Standard Time.

245
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,420
That is eight time zones west of Greenwich.

246
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Remember when we were in Beijing?

247
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,580
Well, then we were in China Standard Time and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich.

248
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,080
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA, because of the huge time difference.

249
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived

250
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,440
in LA the same day at noon.

251
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,640
It's like we went back in time.

252
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
All right, we're back.

253
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
Now, this is actually something that really does happen, right?

254
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
If you take off in an airplane from Beijing, you fly for a certain amount of hours and

255
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,480
you reach California and it's still the same time.

256
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,240
You reach it in the same day.

257
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
It's very strange.

258
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,560
The same thing happens to me when I go home.

259
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,400
I leave Shanghai and I arrive in Chicago and I arrive at the exact same time I left on

260
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
the same day.

261
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,640
It's like time never passed.

262
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,820
It's the longest day of your entire life, because it's not 24 hours.

263
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,300
The flight is 14 hours.

264
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,280
It's really 24, 38 hours long, right?

265
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,040
It's really intense and exhausting.

266
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,060
Then what happens is when you do the opposite.

267
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,800
You go from Chicago to Shanghai, then you go into the future pretty much, right?

268
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,160
Because you left on a Sunday, but you arrive on a Tuesday.

269
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,720
Or in my case, yeah, you leave on a Sunday and you'd arrive on a Monday and you lose

270
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,840
half a day of your life.

271
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,840
You're just sitting there and all of a sudden it goes past you.

272
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,520
So it all evens out in the end.

273
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,160
So when you go back or when you come, it all evens out.

274
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,560
You recover, you get those hours of your life back pretty much.

275
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
They're not gone forever.

276
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
All right.
