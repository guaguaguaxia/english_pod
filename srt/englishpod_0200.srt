00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,440
And my name is Katherine and we've got a special announcement to make today.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
That's right.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
This is lesson number 200.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
Woohoo!

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,440
Woohoo!

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
So good job EnglishPod.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,200
We have over 200 lessons already in our library so that's like enough for like six months

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,600
of continuous learning I think.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,980
But the lessons keep coming and they keep getting better so of course you should continue

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
to listen to us.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,360
We just thought we would mention that today is the special number 200.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Exactly.

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,040
And because it's a special number we're going to talk about a very laid back topic but very

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
interesting nonetheless.

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,800
We're talking about junk food.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,200
You might argue that it's actually too laid back and is the cause of many problems in

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,800
America and other places in the world.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,980
Junk food is unhealthy food.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,720
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about

22
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,720
what's going on.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm hungry.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Sure.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,440
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,480
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

29
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Pizza, fries, burgers and hot dogs.

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
You have to start eating better.

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,080
I have salads sometimes.

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,240
Yeah, right.

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,280
I'm serious.

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,960
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
It's really not healthy.

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
Fine.

39
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,040
I'll start drinking water and having home cooked meals that are low in fat.

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Are you happy now?

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,560
It's a start but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,080
Alright, we're back.

43
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,480
So let's take a look at some of the great words and phrases all about junk food now

44
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,360
in Language Takeaway.

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,400
Language Takeaway.

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
My favorite.

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
This stuff makes me hungry.

48
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
But it's not very good for you.

49
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
It's not.

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
It's terrible.

51
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,160
Actually, his favorite food was burger and fries.

52
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I had it for dinner last night.

53
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Really?

54
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
You had burger and fries?

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Yeah, maybe.

56
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,240
Well, it's not very healthy and there's a great way to describe this.

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
The word is unhealthy.

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
Alright, so yes, as you say, it's very unhealthy.

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,960
Well, yeah, because you get fat.

60
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
They're very high in calories.

61
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
So it's unhealthy.

62
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
So that means it's not good for you.

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
That's right.

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,780
So just a reminder, in English, when we hear the word unhealthy or unhappy, this means

65
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,400
not healthy, not happy.

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,840
Un is a prefix that means not.

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Okay, and talking about unhealthy food, in general, what are we talking about?

68
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,280
We're talking about fast food.

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,080
Okay, so this might require a story.

70
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,800
What is the meaning behind fast food as opposed to slow food?

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Because there is no slow food, right?

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,480
I think now they have it in like France or something like that.

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,360
They talk about slow food.

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,600
But anyways, fast food is food that is prepared very quickly.

75
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,320
So you go, you order, in two or three minutes, you have your entire order ready to go.

76
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,080
Okay, so maybe this is the food that I could get at McDonald's or Burger King where they

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,480
make it very, very quickly and I can go home or I can go to the office with my food ready.

78
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
Exactly.

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,880
So fast food, very popular among countries, very popular nowadays among busy people who

80
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,480
have no time to sit down at a restaurant or eat or sit down and have a proper lunch.

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
Fast food.

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,840
And one of the important drinks at a fast food restaurant is a carbonated drink.

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,160
So this carbonated, what does this mean?

84
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,880
This is actually the fancy word for soda or for fizzy drink.

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Fizzy, okay.

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,360
So something that's carbonated has bubbles.

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,640
Yeah, it has bubbles.

88
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,040
For example, a lot of Europeans drink carbonated water.

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,520
That means water with bubbles in it.

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
That's right.

91
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,440
So actually, the bubbles are caused because the drink has a high concentration of a certain

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
gas such as carbon.

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,240
So that's why it has all these bubbles and it's fizzy like Coca-Cola for example.

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,640
Right, Coca-Cola or Sprite, these are carbonated drinks.

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Very good.

96
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,160
So you have carbonated water and you have carbonated soda.

97
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,000
What is the thing that makes soda different?

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What is it that makes soda taste so good?

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,040
It's sweet and the ingredient that makes it sweet is called fructose syrup.

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,080
Fructose syrup is essentially sugar.

101
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,440
Yeah, and it comes from corn I believe, right?

102
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
That's right.

103
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,240
So you can also hear the name corn syrup and this is a sweet syrup that comes from corn

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,800
that makes drinks like Sprite and Coca-Cola taste so good.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,160
It's also very unhealthy for you.

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Yes, because it has a lot of calories.

107
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,960
So that is one of the main ingredients in soda.

108
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,200
Now you know you have fructose syrup.

109
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,560
Alright, so that's all we've got for Language Takeaway.

110
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
Let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,000
We'll be back in a second.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm hungry.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Sure.

115
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,160
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

116
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Pizza, fries, burgers and hot dogs.

119
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
You have to start eating better.

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,760
I have salad sometimes.

122
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Yeah, right.

123
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm serious.

124
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,460
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,360
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

126
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,720
It's really not healthy.

127
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Fine.

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,640
I'll start drinking water and having home-cooked meals that are low in fat.

129
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Are you happy now?

130
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,720
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,900
Alright, we're back.

132
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,800
So now we have a couple of great phrases that we heard along the dialogue.

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,080
So let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Fluency Builder.

135
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,960
Alright, so starting off.

136
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,200
This is a very interesting phrase because we saw it in the first sentence and it says,

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,680
let's go grab a bite to eat.

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,720
Let's grab a bite to eat.

139
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,240
So to grab is to hold something with your hand, okay, to do it quickly.

140
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
He grabbed my arm.

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,080
So to grab a bite to eat, a bite is a small taste.

142
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,980
We're going to have a quick meal.

143
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,960
So after work, you want to go grab a bite to eat?

144
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
That means let's go have something to eat quickly.

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,480
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

146
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,160
Let me just grab a bite to eat.

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,800
So bite is a little bit.

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,900
It's a small amount of food.

149
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,920
Now for our next phrase, it's very important because I've noticed that a lot of our English

150
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,000
learners make the mistake of using this phrase.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,720
It's how about.

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
How about.

153
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,000
So in today's dialogue, the phrase is, how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,080
So how about is used as a suggestion is, how do you feel or what do you think of going

155
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,560
home and preparing a couple of sandwiches?

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,000
So another way to say this is, why don't we go home and prepare some sandwiches?

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Exactly.

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,720
But commonly, English learners make the mistake of using how about as a way of saying how

159
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
was it or how is it.

160
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,520
So for example, how about your weekend?

161
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Wrong.

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay.

163
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,240
So how was your weekend?

164
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Exactly.

165
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,640
So how about is usually used when we make a suggestion.

166
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,000
How about we go see a movie on Saturday?

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Or how about we go to my parents' house for Christmas this year?

168
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,720
Or finally, how about you get another job so that we can have more money to spend on

169
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
going out to eat?

170
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Very good.

171
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,660
So how about, these are all suggestions.

172
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,080
Why don't you get another job?

173
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,300
Why don't we go to our parents' house for Christmas?

174
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,280
So you can't say, how about your weekend?

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,940
You say, how was your weekend?

176
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,380
So there's a big difference there.

177
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,380
Very good.

178
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,960
So make sure to stay away from that typical mistake using how about.

179
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Now moving on, we were talking about fast food and how it's bad for you and she said,

180
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
you know what?

181
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,000
You should also cut down on your sugar intake.

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,680
So to cut down, that's a phrasal verb.

183
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
That's right.

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Cut down.

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
So that means to decrease.

186
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm trying to cut down on the amount of soda that I drink.

187
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Or I'm trying to cut down on how much I spend on the weekends.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,320
So to cut down means to decrease or to lessen.

190
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Very good.

191
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,240
And for our last phrase, the whole thing that we're talking about and one of the favorite

192
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,880
meals for everyone, burger and fries.

193
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Okay.

194
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,660
So this is one of many combinations for meals.

195
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,920
You can have a burger and fries, which is a hamburger and French fries.

196
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,080
So oftentimes you'll say, hey, let's go grab a burger and fries.

197
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,440
Another combination, especially in England, is fish and chips.

198
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah.

199
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Fish and chips.

200
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,240
Fish would be a fried fish sandwich and chips would be French fries as well.

201
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
That's right.

202
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,000
So actually in England, they call French fries, they call them chips.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,680
So if you're confused by the word chips or potato chips and French fries, these are different

204
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,980
things in different places.

205
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,220
But if you're talking to an American, French fries is the way to go.

206
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,040
Or for a while, they were called freedom fries.

207
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
Well, we don't need to talk about that.

208
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,080
We can talk about that in a later lesson.

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,840
But for now, the phrase is burger and fries.

210
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
All right.

211
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,680
Let's listen to our dialogue for the very last time.

212
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm hungry.

213
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

214
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Sure.

215
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?

216
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Nah, let's get a burger and fries.

217
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
What you ever do is have unhealthy fast food.

218
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,400
Pizza, fries, burgers, and hot dogs.

219
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,840
You have to start eating better.

220
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,280
What are you talking about?

221
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
I have salads sometimes.

222
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Yeah, right.

223
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm serious.

224
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,480
You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well.

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup.

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
It's really not healthy.

227
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Fine.

228
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,520
I'll start drinking water and having home cooked meals that are low in fat.

229
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Are you happy now?

230
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:51,240
It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise.

231
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
We're back, Marco.

232
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
You're laughing.

233
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,320
I know you like junk food.

234
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,120
What's your favorite junk food of all time?

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,400
Actually, I am a big, big fan of fried chicken.

236
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
I love fried chicken.

237
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Yummy.

238
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I don't know.

239
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,120
I think it's really greasy and oily and it's very, very bad, but I can't help it.

240
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
It's very good.

241
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
You can buy bags of it in America.

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
I know.

243
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
You can get like a pound bag of fried chicken.

244
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
You buy it by the pound in America, right?

245
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Yep.

246
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,120
You pay for how much it weighs.

247
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Wow.

248
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
That's amazing.

249
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,200
I actually really enjoy it, but places like Kentucky Fried Chicken, they're too expensive

250
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
for fried chicken.

251
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,160
Yeah, you don't necessarily want to go there.

252
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,200
There's other places that are a lot more maybe traditional that are pretty good.

253
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
How about you?

254
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
What is your favorite junk food?

255
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Chicago-style hot dog and french fries.

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,760
When you go to see a baseball game, you get a hot dog, but Chicago-style is good.

257
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,400
It's not too much stuff on it.

258
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,360
You have a poppy seed bun, so it's a bun, a piece of bread with some seeds on it and

259
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,640
a lot of mustard and ketchup and onions.

260
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,160
I really enjoy hot dogs, but the one thing that I cannot have on a hot dog is mustard

261
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
or relish.

262
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Oh my gosh.

263
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
Those are the two best things.

264
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,680
Okay, I can't talk to you anymore.

265
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,760
Well, tell us what your favorite junk food is and tell Marco that he's crazy if he doesn't

266
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
like mustard.

267
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

268
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Ask us questions as well.

269
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,840
We're happy to answer them.

270
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Until next time.

271
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Bye, everyone.

272
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Thanks for watching.
