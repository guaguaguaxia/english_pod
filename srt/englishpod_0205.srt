00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Hello everyone and welcome to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,700
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,360
My name is Catherine and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
That's right.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,640
We're going to talk a little bit about business and specifically we are in a business meeting

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,200
where we're trying to sell something to someone.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
That's right.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,840
So you're going to hear a lot of talk about chocolate or in this case gourmet bonbons.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
Gourmet bonbons.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,760
This is another word for chocolate candies or candies.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Okay.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,600
So a bonbon is kind of like round usually, right?

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Usually, yes.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Okay.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
All right.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,720
So let's get started and listen to today's dialogue.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:50,000
We'll be back in a moment.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,320
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,360
The ambience here is lovely.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,440
No problem.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,760
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Granger's gourmet

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
bonbons here in the United States.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,640
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,840
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,080
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Granger's and serving these

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,000
chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first-class

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
dining.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hmm.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,160
Sounds interesting.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,760
Gourmet chocolates.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Where are they produced?

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Belgium?

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,440
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Really?

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,480
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,980
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,040
The government is 100% supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,600
tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,800
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,360
Here, I brought these especially for you.

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Try one.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Oh, thanks.

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Hmm.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Hmm.

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Creamy texture.

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Very smooth.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Unique, aren't they?

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,320
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,920
with the ingredients.

54
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,840
Only the creme de la creme make it through inspection.

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Yes.

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Very interesting flavors.

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Slightly spicy.

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Hmm.

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,120
Very unique, that's for sure.

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Exactly what are the ingredients?

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,640
Granger family for generations.

63
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,840
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,960
What's haggis?

66
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,360
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,560
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll get back to you.

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Mr. Johnson.

70
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Mr. Johnson.

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
All right.

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
We're back.

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:22,600
So a lot of interesting vocab there.

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,000
The guy was trying to convince them about these chocolates but it turned out to be something

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,040
a little bit strange and we'll talk about that in a little while.

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,600
Before we get into that, why don't we take a look at seven key words that we have prepared

77
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,000
for you today on Language Takeaway.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,600
So we've divided Language Takeaway into two parts today.

81
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,320
The first part is all about business and manufacturing.

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,680
So what's our first word, Marco?

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
All right.

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,600
So I talked about being the sole distributor for this company called Granger's Gourmet

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Bonbons.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay.

87
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
A distributor.

88
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Okay.

89
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,880
This is a person or a company and the distributor is someone who distributes or sells a product,

90
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
right?

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Right.

92
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
So the factory will make them.

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,080
He will get all these goods from the factory and then he will be the one that gives it

94
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,720
to the different retail stores.

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,100
So he can have many clients and he is the main person who you get it from.

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,280
So obviously they don't get it directly from the factory.

97
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Okay.

98
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,040
So this person, a distributor or a company, is in the middle of the transaction.

99
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,400
On one side there is the manufacturer and on the other side there is the retail market

100
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
or stores.

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Exactly.

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,000
And as you said, that's our second key word today, manufacturer.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,320
Manufacturer, again, is a person or a company that makes a good.

105
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,720
So for example, a television manufacturer makes TV.

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,360
It's like a factory.

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Exactly.

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,680
So they manufacture things.

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
They make them.

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
All right.

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
So we've got distributors who are moving goods.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,760
We have manufacturers who are making them.

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,840
But what happens when we want to move a good out of a country?

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Okay.

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,960
So that is our third word for today.

116
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Usually in customs, we have to pay a tariff for these goods or a tax.

117
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Okay.

118
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,400
So a tariff is a special kind of tax that you pay when you are trying to export or send

119
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,000
outside of your country goods that you've made in that country.

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,800
So for example, if I make 100 TVs in America, but I want to sell these TVs to someone in

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Mexico, I have to pay a tariff.

122
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,760
I have to pay like $10 to the government that allows me to send these out of the country.

123
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
That's right.

124
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
So that is a tariff.

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
And now when he was talking about tariffs and how the government is reducing the tariffs

126
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,640
in order to motivate a business, he talked about also that the government is reducing

127
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,400
or cutting the red tape.

128
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay.

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,560
So he says, listen, they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs.

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,400
So this means that before they were encountering some problems at customs, because customs,

131
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,300
you know, there's a lot of paperwork, there's a lot of taxes, there's a lot of information

132
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,120
you have to provide.

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
It's a hassle.

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
A lot of paperwork.

135
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Right.

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,840
So this kind of paperwork, bureaucracy, this is called red tape in English.

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:27,400
For example, I would love to get a visa for my foreign husband, but there's a lot of red

138
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
tape.

139
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
There's a lot of work that we have to do.

140
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,320
There's a lot of bureaucratic processes that you have to do.

141
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
All right.

142
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,080
So red tape, this means a lot of paperwork, a lot of work that you have to do.

143
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Okay.

144
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,040
So those are our key words that are related to business.

145
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,360
Now let's move on to a couple of different adjectives.

146
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,980
The first one, when he talked about chocolates, he said elegant.

147
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,680
He said that something is elegant.

148
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Okay.

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Elegant.

150
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
This is a great adjective.

151
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,400
You're going to see this on a lot of luxury brand items.

152
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,680
Elegance means something is elegant if it is classy, if it looks really good and rich.

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Or you could say that dress is very elegant, that mink coat is very elegant.

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Okay.

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
This is a positive thing.

156
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,640
So something that looks kind of expensive at times as well.

157
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah, that's right.

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,640
Another word that means looking expensive or elegant is luxurious.

159
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Okay.

160
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,500
So luxurious comes from the noun luxury.

161
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
That's right.

162
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,120
Luxury, luxurious.

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,760
So we can say that the executive suites at this hotel are very luxurious.

164
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,800
They have a jacuzzi, a king-size bed, expensive silk sheets.

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
The best quality materials.

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,800
So you can say that elegant and luxurious kind of go hand in hand.

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
That's right.

168
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Although elegant, you usually say about someone or their clothing or even a car, but luxurious

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,120
is more like a place or an object.

170
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
Okay, good.

171
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,400
And then we have one final word that also describes something that is very rare or very

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
good and rich, a delicacy.

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,360
Yeah, actually this one is a noun, it's a thing.

174
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,360
So we can say that this is a Scottish delicacy or what are the delicacies in your country?

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,880
So delicacy is something that's special.

176
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay.

177
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,240
So for example, you've told me that in Ecuador, there are some interesting food delicacies.

178
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Delicacies?

179
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Little animals.

180
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Yeah.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
For example, guinea pigs.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,360
So it's not really a delicacy, although kind of because guinea pigs are expensive comparatively

183
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,960
to chickens, for example.

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,360
So it is considered to be something that you only eat on special occasions.

185
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Right.

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,120
And in East Asia, many people consider shark's fin soup to be a delicacy.

187
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Right.

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
It's a special dish.

189
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,320
So we can say that it's usually about food and it's rare, something that's rare or special

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,000
or also can be very expensive.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
That's right, a delicacy.

192
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Okay.

193
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,120
So a lot of great interesting words on language takeaway.

194
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,680
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder?

195
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
Fluency builder.

196
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,140
This first phrase is actually something I try to do as often as possible, but it's usually

197
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,280
very difficult.

198
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,560
I combine business with pleasure.

199
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Right.

200
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
To combine business with pleasure.

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Now this is a whole phrase and this talks about doing business, but at the same time,

202
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
doing it in a fun way or an interesting way.

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Right.

204
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,560
And pleasure here means something that is fun or entertainment even.

205
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,080
So for example, going out to dinner with your company is a way to combine business with

206
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
pleasure.

207
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
All right.

208
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,040
Or meeting a client at a bar is combining business with pleasure.

209
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,280
So you're combining things that are fun and things that are work related.

210
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Right.

211
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,800
Because you can have a business meeting in a boardroom or in a business or in a meeting

212
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,600
room, but if you have the same business meeting at a bar where you're talking and laughing,

213
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,960
but also at the same time talking business, then you're combining business with pleasure.

214
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
That's right.

215
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,840
And now for our second phrase, it's more about cheating, right?

216
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Somebody that is cheating or maybe not doing things correctly.

217
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,560
They are cutting corners.

218
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
That's right.

219
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,800
So cutting corners is another way to say cheating.

220
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,320
For example, I've seen people, students cutting corners with their studies.

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,560
You think about cutting corners, it means that you're not going the long way.

222
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,520
You're cutting, you're cheating by going the shorter way.

223
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
You're taking a shortcut.

224
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Taking a shortcut.

225
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,280
So for example, instead of studying for that final test in math, some people write the

226
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,400
formulas on their hands.

227
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,960
This is a way to cut corners.

228
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,380
Instead of studying, you actually cheat by putting it on your hand, making it easier.

229
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,920
So to cut corners is to cheat or to try to take the shortcut, but it kind of has a negative

230
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
connotation, right?

231
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Oh, definitely.

232
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,520
So most people will say, don't cut corners.

233
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,400
In the end, it's not worth it.

234
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Right.

235
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,740
And for our final phrase, we have one that it's in French.

236
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,560
So this one is in French, but it's also a very common English phrase.

237
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,240
That's why we're going to teach it to you.

238
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,080
The creme de la creme.

239
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Okay.

240
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,720
So literally, in translated from French, that means the cream of the cream.

241
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Right.

242
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,320
In English, we would say that it's the best of the best.

243
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
The best of the best.

244
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
The very top.

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
So that's what this phrase means.

246
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,440
The best of the best.

247
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
The very top.

248
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,680
The most excellent.

249
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,640
So you could say, Harvard University attracts the creme de la creme of American high school

250
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
students.

251
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Okay.

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
So the very best of American high school students.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
All right.

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,880
So that phrase, it's in French, but you can say it in English, right?

255
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
Like fiance, for example.

256
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Fiance.

257
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Creme de la creme.

258
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,640
So those are the words that we've stolen from French and we use in English.

259
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,720
So don't worry about how you pronounce it in English.

260
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,600
We just say creme de la creme.

261
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Okay.

262
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,440
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back in just a

263
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,560
bit.

264
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,760
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson.

265
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,880
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

266
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,920
The ambience here is lovely.

267
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
No problem.

268
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,320
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

269
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

270
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,200
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Granger's Gourmet

271
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Bonbons here in the United States.

272
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,160
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,400
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

274
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,640
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Granger's, and serving these

275
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,560
chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first-class

276
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
dining.

277
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
Hmm, sounds interesting.

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,320
Gourmet chocolates.

279
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Where are they produced?

280
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Belgium?

281
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

282
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Really?

283
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,040
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

284
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,540
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

285
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,480
The government is 100% supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a

286
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,240
low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

287
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,440
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

288
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,000
Here, I brought these especially for you.

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Try one.

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, thanks.

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hmm, hmm.

292
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Creamy texture.

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Very smooth.

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Unique, aren't they?

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,560
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

296
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,940
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners

297
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,560
with the ingredients.

298
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,400
Only the creme de la creme make it through inspection.

299
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,920
Yes, very interesting flavors.

300
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Slightly spicy.

301
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
Hmm, very unique, that's for sure.

302
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
Exactly what are the ingredients?

303
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,880
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the

304
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,160
Granger family for generations.

305
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

306
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,480
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

307
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
Haggis.

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,520
What's haggis?

309
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,920
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

310
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,160
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

311
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,840
I'll get back to you.

312
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Mr. Johnson?

313
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Mr. Johnson?

314
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,840
All right, we're back.

315
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,200
So now this Scottish delicacy.

316
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
What is this haggis?

317
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Haggis.

318
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Haggis.

319
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,640
Okay, haggis, I've never actually eaten it.

320
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,120
It does sound pretty disgusting.

321
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,360
It's a Scottish delicacy that I think involves stuffing like what?

322
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
What do we hear?

323
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Pig liver?

324
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Let's see this again.

325
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,520
So basically you take a sheep's liver, a heart, and a lung, and you put it inside the sheep's

326
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,560
stomach and you serve that.

327
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
And you cook it.

328
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Yeah, you cook it like that.

329
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
You cook it.

330
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,200
And so it's like all the insides of a sheep.

331
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Yeah.

332
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,040
It kind of sounds disgusting, but I'm pretty sure it tastes pretty good.

333
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
It probably tastes good.

334
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Because it's a Scottish delicacy, so eh.

335
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,520
Yeah, I don't know.

336
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,040
Although I cannot imagine eating it in a chocolate.

337
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,080
This is disgusting.

338
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,200
I've heard of countries where they take a chicken, they stuff it with something, like

339
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,560
they have a stuffing, and then they put the chicken inside a goat, and then the goat inside

340
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,960
a bigger animal, and then they cook all that together.

341
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, wow.

342
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,520
And then you have this amazing, obviously it's huge, they use these big brick ovens

343
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,400
to cook them, but you have this platter with three different types of meats.

344
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Oh, wow.

345
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
We have that in America.

346
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Really?

347
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
It's called a turducken.

348
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Turducken.

349
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,800
Turkey, ducken, turkey, duck, and chicken.

350
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,200
So you have a chicken inside of a duck, which you put inside of a turkey.

351
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Turkey, wow.

352
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
And you bake it.

353
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Wow, how does it taste?

354
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Delicious.

355
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
It's a very special taste.

356
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
See?

357
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Exactly.

358
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,160
So if you want to know what your national delicacy is, do you have a delicacy in your

359
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
home country?

360
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Let us know on EnglishPod.com.

361
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,500
We're always curious to talk about food, but we would love to have you practicing on the

362
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,720
website and asking any questions that you may have.

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
That's right.

364
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
So we'll see everyone there.

365
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Until next time.

366
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Bye.

367
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:33,900
Bye.
