00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,440
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,080
And today, Marco, we're talking about something that I know you're a big fan of.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
I am.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,440
We're talking about computer games, video games.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,080
So yeah, we're going to be looking at some vocabulary and phrases related to computer

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
games and video games.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,680
And this is actually a request from one of our users.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
Awesome.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,360
So before we get started, we do have the name of the game that we're going to look at.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,040
So let's listen to that in today's vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
All right.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,040
So the game that we're going to preview today is called Counter Strike.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Okay.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,680
So first you have a strike or an attack.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
Right.

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
Then you have a counter strike.

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,680
So that's an opposite attack or something like that.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Right.

22
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,080
So it's a reaction to the first thing that happens.

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,600
So you hit me and my counter strike is I hit you back.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,520
And this game is actually very, very popular all over the world because many players are

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,120
able to compete at the same time.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,240
So it's a shooting game.

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
You shoot each other.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,200
You are the terrorists and then the other team is like the police or the army or whatever.

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Wow.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Sounds really exciting.

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,260
Well, we're going to learn more about the specific vocab that goes with computer games

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,800
and video games in a minute.

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,680
But first, let's take a listen to our dialogue.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Mark, where have you been?

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
I've been calling you all morning.

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,040
I've been playing computer games.

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
What?

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,320
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,160
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,260
What are you playing?

41
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,480
It's called Counter Strike.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,880
It's a first person shooter game.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,140
It's awesome.

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,680
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
the world.

46
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,720
You've been wasting your time on this?

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,120
I can't believe it.

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,520
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,120
My laptop is on my bed.

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,520
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Fine.

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Go, go, go.

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Take the point.

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Taking fire.

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Need assistance.

56
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Damn it.

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
How are you killing me with a single shot?

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
It's not fair.

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,880
I don't want to play anymore.

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,400
Let's go get something to eat.

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
Can you bring me something?

62
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,040
I'm totally hooked on this game.

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,600
All right, we're back.

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,680
So there was some really interesting vocab here.

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,240
And so let's look at it now in Language Takeaway.

66
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Language Takeaway.

67
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,160
Okay, so what kind of a game was this, Marco?

68
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
All right.

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,080
So the game was a FPS or also in the dialogue we heard a first person shooter game.

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,600
So our users might have heard this phrase first person before because it's a grammar

71
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
term in many ways.

72
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Right.

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We talk about I.

74
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I do this.

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I can sing.

76
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
That's the first person.

77
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,680
But when we're talking about games, first person shooter means that what you do, you're

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,480
doing as if you were the character in the game.

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Right.

80
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,280
So even the way that you're looking at the game, it seems like you're looking through

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
the eyes of the character.

82
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,760
Okay, so you don't see the body.

83
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
You are the body of the person.

84
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
You are the body.

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Exactly.

86
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
So first person shooter.

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,640
So shooter obviously means that this is a shooting game.

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,560
What you do is you pull the trigger and shoot people.

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Exactly.

90
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,040
And as we mentioned, a lot of players are able to compete against each other.

91
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
So it's called a multiplayer game.

92
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,560
Okay, so multi is a prefix.

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,460
It goes at the beginning of a word.

94
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,640
In English that means many.

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Many.

96
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,520
So it can be either multi-colored or multi-ethnic.

97
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,320
And the meaning of this is that there are many different colors or many different ethnicities

98
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,760
or in this case, multiplayer, many different players at the same time.

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Exactly.

100
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,920
So in this game, many players can play whether it's in a local area network or online over

101
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
the internet.

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Cool.

103
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,400
So you actually have to have the internet, right, when you're doing this because you're

104
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,060
using many different computers.

105
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,880
So they have to be connected to each other.

106
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Right.

107
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
So and that's our next word.

108
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,000
It's called go online in order to play.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Okay, so online you've heard before.

110
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,080
Online means on the internet.

111
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,760
But in this case, the action of using the internet is called going online.

112
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,160
So I want to go online to read my email.

113
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Right.

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Or I can't go online.

115
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,680
I don't have a connection.

116
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,200
My mom won't let me go online.

117
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm in trouble.

118
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
All right.

119
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400
So this is the way that you use it.

120
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,900
You go online.

121
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,440
In order to use the internet, you go online.

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Very interesting.

123
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,800
Well, the last word we've got here in language takeaway is a very important one when we talk

124
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,480
about video games because many people are in this situation.

125
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,280
They're hooked on video games.

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Right.

127
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,120
So if you are hooked on a video game or you are hooked on anything, it means you're kind

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,360
of addicted or you're very, very interested in something.

129
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Exactly.

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,400
So I'm hooked on the TV show True Blood.

131
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,480
I love to watch it and I love, every day I run home so I can watch it.

132
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,080
But is there a game that you're hooked on, Marco?

133
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Currently, I am hooked on a game called Guitar Hero Metallica.

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Ooh, fun.

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah, it's really fun.

136
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,560
When I borrowed your PS3, I was hooked on Bad Company.

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
They're great games.

138
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,880
It's very easy to get hooked on video games.

139
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Too easy.

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
All right.

141
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,120
So that's all the words we have for language takeaway.

142
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

143
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Mark where have you been?

144
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,800
I've been calling you all morning.

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
I've been playing computer games.

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
What?

147
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,900
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

148
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,760
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

149
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,840
What are you playing?

150
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,060
It's called Counter Strike.

151
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,440
It's a first person shooter game.

152
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720
It's awesome.

153
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,260
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over

154
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,720
the world.

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
You've been wasting your time on this.

156
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,680
I can't believe it.

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,360
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

158
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,960
My laptop is on my bed.

159
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,320
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

160
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Fine.

161
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,060
Damn it.

162
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,760
How are you killing me with a single shot?

163
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
It's not fair.

164
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,880
I don't want to play anymore.

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's go get something to eat.

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
Can you bring me something?

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm totally hooked on this game.

168
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Alright, we're back and we have a couple of phrases that we want to look at, specifically

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,220
two phrases.

170
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,600
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,560
Fluency Builder.

172
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
So what's the deal?

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,320
You blew me off yesterday and now you're not even going to say sorry?

174
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,720
Alright, so blew me off.

175
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,120
What do you mean when you say you blew me off yesterday?

176
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,800
Okay, so let's take a look at the infinitive version of this phrase.

177
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,940
So to blow someone off.

178
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
And they all go together.

179
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,400
It's a fixed phrase.

180
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,040
And this means to have an appointment with someone, but to not go.

181
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,120
So we had a date planned, but he blew me off.

182
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
What a jerk.

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
He didn't go.

184
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I went.

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
Did he tell you that he wasn't going to go?

186
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
No.

187
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
So it's a surprise.

188
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,600
It's like you expect someone to come meet you or do something with you, but they don't

189
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,120
say anything and they don't go.

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,080
So there's another word very similar to this one and it's to stand someone up, right?

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Exactly.

192
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
So he stood me up.

193
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,120
He didn't come.

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
He blew me off.

195
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,880
Okay, very good.

196
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,160
Alright and what's our next phrase?

197
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
To waste your time.

198
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
Alright so the girlfriend in this case was like, you're wasting your time on these video

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,060
games.

200
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,400
That means you're not getting anything out of this.

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
You're not benefiting.

202
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,280
It means that you could spend your time doing other things.

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,920
So if you're wasting your time on video games, you're not being productive.

204
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Exactly so.

205
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
You're not learning anything.

206
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,040
So your mother might say to you when you're a kid, don't waste your time on games.

207
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,400
You should be studying.

208
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Okay, or he wastes a lot of time watching TV.

209
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,480
That's a common problem.

210
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:14,840
Alright, so let's listen to this dialogue again real fast and we'll be back in a bit.

211
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Good luck.

212
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Where have you been?

213
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I've been calling you all morning.

214
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,640
I've been playing computer games.

215
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
What?

216
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,900
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

217
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,760
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

218
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,840
What are you playing?

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,060
It's called Counter Strike.

220
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,460
It's a first person shooter game.

221
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,720
It's awesome.

222
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,260
It's a multi-player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over

223
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,740
the world.

224
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,280
You've been wasting your time on this?

225
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
I can't believe it.

226
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,120
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

227
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
My laptop is on my bed.

228
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

229
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Fine.

230
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Damn it! How are you killing me with a single shot? It's not fair!

231
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't want to play anymore! Let's go get something to eat.

232
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,920
Can you bring me something? I'm totally hooked on this game.

233
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,080
All right, so we talked about, you know, being hooked on TV shows and video games,

234
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,280
but this is actually a very big problem in some Asian countries specifically, right?

235
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,240
I've heard that. Actually, I heard that in Japan, Korea, and China specifically,

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,440
there are psychological treatment centers for kids who are addicted to gaming.

237
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
And so there's a big thing in the news in China recently where

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,120
there were parents who were sending their kids to this treatment center, rehab for games,

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
and that actually they found out that the rehab center didn't know what they were doing,

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
and they were giving the kids electroshock therapy to get them off games.

241
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Really?

242
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,320
So the parents took their kids back.

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,120
That's scary.

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
It is scary.

245
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,400
I guess it's a very popular thing in Asian countries specifically, right? To play online,

246
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,920
to go online. There's a lot of other factors that influence this, but

247
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,280
I think it is like everything in excess is dangerous.

248
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,360
This is true. And actually, some people have been using this addiction

249
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,080
to be a productive use of their time. So you have some people who play a game called World

250
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,720
of Warcraft.

251
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Uh-huh, and they win money.

252
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,400
And they win money, and they sell things to other players all over the world.

253
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,480
Right.

254
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,760
And so you have these kids in America buying toys and like shields and-

255
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
And gold.

256
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,480
Gold from kids in, for example, Indonesia.

257
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,720
Right.

258
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
And the kid in Indonesia is making money.

259
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,120
Right, right, right. And also, if they're really good, they go on to become professional gamers

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,160
and compete in world competitions and also test out new video games. So yeah,

261
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
it has its advantages as well.

262
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,120
Can you imagine what your business card would look like? Professional gamer.

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
Professional gamer. All right.

264
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,360
That's all the time we have for today. We hope you enjoyed this lesson. And of course,
