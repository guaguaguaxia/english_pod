00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,920
And my name is Catherine and today we have an exciting lesson for everyone out there,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
very cultural.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,800
Exactly, very closely related to our Halloween lesson that we had but on this occasion we're

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
going to be looking at All Saints Day.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,040
Alright, so this is a festival that's celebrated in many different countries and we're learning

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,680
today about some of the ceremonies and practices in those countries that are very closely tied

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,400
to those local cultures.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Exactly, so we're going to learn a little bit about culture and at the same time we're

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,480
going to learn some great words and phrases.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,560
So let's get started with this dialogue for the first time.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:52,040
The day of the dead has arrived.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,840
All souls day and all saints day.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Your neighbor is crazy.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,060
Why is he screaming that?

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,920
Because today is the first of November, the day of the dead.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Oh, that's right.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,560
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Seriously?

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,520
I thought it was just like any other day except for the fact that people visit the cemetery

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
and remember their loved ones.

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,360
Well that's just part of it.

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,120
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,360
In Mexico for example it's common to see people building private altars honoring the deceased,

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,120
using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed and visiting

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,360
graves with these as gifts.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
In the Philippines the tombs are cleaned or repainted.

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,960
Candles are lit and flowers are offered.

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,160
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relative's

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
tombs.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Whoa, that's scary.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,320
I don't know if I could do that.

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Why?

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,760
We should fear the living, not the dead.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,600
And we're back, so did you know about these traditions in the Philippines and in Mexico?

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,720
I know about the Mexican ones because there's a lot of Mexicans where I come from in Chicago

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,480
and they still celebrate these things.

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,440
But I didn't know about the Philippines so I found this really interesting.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Interesting, right?

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,800
Actually, yeah, the Philippines as well as Mexico are very Catholic countries so maybe

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,520
that's one of the reasons why they have these events that are so important for their culture.

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm sure, yeah.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,320
All right, so before we start talking a little bit more about the culture, why don't we take

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,000
a look at language takeaway.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Language takeaway.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All right, the first word is a very common word especially if you're a church-going person.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The word is altar.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, an altar.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
An altar, it's a thing.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,600
It's a thing and an altar is usually found inside a church as you said, right?

52
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
That's right.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
So it's like a...

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Table.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
It's like a table.

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Or a counter.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,240
So the altar in the church is where the priest does all of the stuff that he does during

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
the mass.

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,520
It's where he prepares the bread and the wine and it's essentially a table, yeah.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,040
But you can build an altar for yourself in your garden, for example, right?

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,960
And it doesn't have to do with the Catholic religion necessarily.

62
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,040
No, not necessarily.

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,880
You could have an altar in a Greek pagan temple where you give offerings to a god or goddess.

64
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,080
So in this case, an altar is a special religious table where you perform certain religious

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,280
rites or functions.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Okay, very interesting.

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,400
All right, and so it's common in Mexico for people to build private altars honoring the

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,760
deceased.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400
So what is this word, deceased?

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,880
All right, deceased is a noun.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,680
It's a word that we use to call someone who's dead or departed.

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,200
So the deceased was named John Smith.

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,560
So it's like a more technical term of saying somebody is dead.

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Right, and it's something that you'll often read in the newspaper when they don't want

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,520
to say the dead guy.

76
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,440
The deceased was a doctor and he is survived by three children.

77
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,440
And so deceased is a way to describe a person in a nicer way.

78
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,240
Right, very good, the deceased.

79
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,520
And you mentioned another word that's very closely related to deceased, the departed.

80
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,240
That's right, and this is actually a famous word because of a Martin Scorsese movie that

81
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,440
came out about two years ago.

82
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,600
And departed, you know the word to depart, to leave.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,880
A person that is a departed is someone who has left us.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,680
It's a dead person.

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
So you can say the deceased or the departed, which basically means the same thing as the

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,000
dead guy or the dead person.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,280
Exactly, but again, it's much more polite.

88
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
It's something that we hear often at funerals or that we read in magazines.

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,840
Okay, so for example, All Saints Day is a way of honoring the departed.

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
Exactly, very nice sounding.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Yeah, it sounds better.

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,160
All right, so talking a little bit more about the departed and the traditions, it says here

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,520
that many Mexicans use sugar skulls or have sugar skulls during this festivity.

94
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
That's right.

95
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,840
So a skull is the bones from a person's head.

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,200
And so you can often see these on, for example, pirate ships.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,360
We say skull and crossbones.

98
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,640
And so it's the bones from a head and you have the bones underneath.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,400
It's a very popular image on Halloween because it's scary.

100
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,360
But a skull is essentially the bones from a head.

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,200
So it's like a person's head without the skin, eyes, lips, everything.

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Right, it's scary because it has empty black spaces where the eyes are supposed to be and

103
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,280
you can see all the teeth, but nothing else.

104
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
What about the sugar skulls?

105
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
What are these?

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
They're skulls made of sugar.

107
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
That's right.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,000
And so they look like skulls because there's no cheeks and there's no skin or eyes, but

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,480
they're beautiful because the Mexicans in their tradition, they color the sugar.

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,480
So you can have white skulls with this beautiful green and pink and red and blue decorations

111
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,840
and you can eat them because they're made of sugar.

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,440
And so it's a special treat that people have in the Mexican tradition on the Day of the

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Dead.

114
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Very good.

115
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,240
And one of the many traditions apart from sugar skulls and building private altars,

116
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,720
they also visit the person's tomb, if possible, right?

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Exactly.

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,680
So a tomb is an important word.

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,460
So what is a tomb?

120
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,600
A tomb is a place where someone is buried.

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,880
It's a space or a place and it can be big or small, but it's essentially the resting

122
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,200
place of a dead person.

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
All right.

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
So a tomb, where the person is.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
And actually on the tomb, you have the tombstone, right?

126
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
That's right.

127
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,800
And a tombstone is the same as a gravestone and it's a piece of rock on which you write

128
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,120
the name and the birth date and the death date of the person that is buried there.

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Right.

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
So that's the tombstone.

131
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Very good.

132
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Okay.

133
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,720
So an interesting amount of words here on Language Takeaway.

134
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:57,400
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Your neighbor is crazy.

136
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Why is he screaming that?

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,520
Because today is the first of November, the Day of the Dead.

138
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, that's right.

139
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,160
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

140
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Seriously?

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,560
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the

142
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
cemetery and remember their loved ones.

143
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,920
Well, that's just part of it.

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,680
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

145
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,760
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars honoring the

146
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,100
deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed

147
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,920
and visiting graves with these as gifts.

148
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,720
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted.

149
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,520
Candles are lit and flowers are offered.

150
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,800
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives'

151
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
tombs.

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Whoa, that's scary.

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
I don't know if I could do that.

154
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Why?

155
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,960
We should fear the living, not the dead.

156
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,280
All right, we're back.

157
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,640
So why don't we look at three main phrases on Fluency Builder now?

158
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Fluency Builder.

159
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Well, the first phrase should be obvious by now because it is the name of the holiday

160
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,320
we're talking about and the name is the Day of the Dead.

161
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
The Day of the Dead.

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,680
So this is their day.

163
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,920
It is and it's the Day of the Dead because it's the day in which people around the world

164
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,280
celebrate the departed.

165
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,240
It's when they talk about and remember people that they've loved who've died.

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Okay.

167
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,840
So it's not really like a sad day, right?

168
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,760
It's more of a happy remembering them and honoring them and how much you miss them,

169
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,200
but in a good way.

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Exactly.

171
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,880
And you're not actually going to hear this very often in reference to American culture

172
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,300
because it's not something Americans do and English people don't do either.

173
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,720
But people, when they're talking about their own families and traditions, will want to

174
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,640
talk about this because in the Philippines or in Latin America, you have a very strong

175
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
culture, like a very strong tradition of celebrating this.

176
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
So.

177
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
All right.

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,340
And as we mentioned, this day is a day to honor or to remember your loved ones.

179
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,120
And that's our second phrase, your loved ones.

180
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,720
The phrase loved ones might not be obvious to many people because you can love many people

181
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,400
and many things, but loved ones is a phrase that generally means the people that you care

182
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,680
about the most, your friends and your family.

183
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,240
So you could say, I want to have a party, but I only want my loved ones to be there.

184
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Okay.

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,520
Or he was in the hospital and all of his loved ones visited him.

186
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,880
So all those people, not necessarily only family, it's friends and family that you love.

187
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Exactly.

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
And so those are the people in the world that are the very closest to you.

189
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Okay.

190
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,200
And our last phrase and probably one of the most interesting traditions that we were able

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,720
to see in this dialogue is that people in the Philippines camp out in cemeteries on

192
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,760
their family or loved ones tomb.

193
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
That's right.

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,060
So the phrase to camp out means to stay overnight to bring food and a tent or blankets.

195
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,320
And it essentially means to make a camp so you can stay there.

196
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
And this is very unusual to me because I can't imagine sleeping in a graveyard.

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
I think I get the goosebumps.

198
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Right.

199
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,000
So camp out or you can just say camp, right?

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,400
You don't necessarily have to say both of them.

201
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Right.

202
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,120
You can camp or you can camp out and camp out generally means that you're staying in

203
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
a place that is temporary.

204
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Okay.

205
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Very good.

206
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,520
So interesting phrases as well on Fluency Builder today.

207
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,680
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

208
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,120
The Day of the Dead has arrived.

209
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,920
All souls day and all saints day.

210
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Your neighbor is crazy.

211
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,120
Why is he screaming that?

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,040
Because today is the first of November, the Day of the Dead.

213
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Oh, that's right.

214
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,720
This is a very special day among many cultures around the world, especially in Latin America.

215
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Seriously?

216
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,100
I thought it was just like any other day, except for the fact that people visit the

217
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,360
cemetery and remember their loved ones.

218
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
Well, that's just part of it.

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,200
People across the world celebrate in different ways.

220
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,280
In Mexico, for example, it's common to see people building private altars honoring the

221
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,600
deceased, using sugar skulls, preparing the favorite foods and beverages of the departed

222
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,440
and visiting graves with these as gifts.

223
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,200
In the Philippines, the tombs are cleaned or repainted.

224
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,040
Candles are lit and flowers are offered.

225
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Entire families camp out in cemeteries and sometimes spend a night or two near the relatives'

226
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
tombs.

227
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Oh, that's scary.

228
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,440
I don't know if I could do that.

229
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Why?

230
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,720
We should fear the living, not the dead.

231
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,320
All right, we're back.

232
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,040
So, Catherine, you mentioned that in Anglo-Saxon culture, England or in the United States,

233
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,920
you don't have this type of tradition of honoring the dead or something like that, but you

234
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,720
do visit the tomb of your loved ones or the cemetery as well, right?

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
People do, definitely.

236
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,720
But you just don't have a national day where you do this.

237
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,680
Well, Veterans Day is a day when we celebrate people who were killed in wars or people who

238
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,320
participated in wars.

239
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,800
So in America, we have a day called Memorial Day in which we remember the people who have

240
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,640
died serving the country in the military.

241
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,880
And so Memorial Day is a day in which many people like to go to the graveyards and to

242
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,840
lay flowers or to remember the dead.

243
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,080
But it really depends on your family.

244
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,080
I mean, some people like to go the day a person died and on the anniversary or on a

245
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,200
special day for them.

246
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,920
So it's very private and personal and individual.

247
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,000
It's not something that we all do on one particular day.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,560
And I think what may strike many people as different is that you visit the cemetery and

249
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,360
if you ever have the chance to be in Mexico or in a Hispanic country, you will see that

250
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,920
it's full of people and it's actually a, there's a lot of food and people are there eating

251
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,280
on the tomb and just, and they've actually prepared the food that was the deceased's

252
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
favorite.

253
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,000
Wow, that's really nice though as a gesture because it's another way to remember the person

254
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and to celebrate how, how, like things that were happy for them.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Exactly.

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,320
And it's a way of actually sharing a meal with that person even though that person isn't

257
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,520
with you anymore in this world.

258
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,280
So yeah, it's actually very interesting.

259
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,040
It goes back again to a little bit of the culture and the folklore and everything from

260
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
different countries.

261
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,360
And we want to know what you guys do or how you remember your deceased because each country

262
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
has its own particular little very interesting way of doing it.

263
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
That's right.

264
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,640
So please share with us on our website EnglishPod.com your own traditions and the culture that you

265
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,560
have in your home country or town.

266
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,880
And we're very curious to hear those.

267
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,840
But also if you have questions as always, please ask because we're happy to answer those.

268
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
All right.

269
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
So we'll see you guys there.

270
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Bye everyone.

271
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Bye, bye.
