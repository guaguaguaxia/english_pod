00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,120
And today with Erika we have an upper intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,300
That's right, an upper intermediate lesson that's a little bit strange.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,600
It's a little bit strange but it's a real English lesson because that's what we give

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
you here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
So in today's lesson we've got a lot of really great language for you.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
We've got language to help you to gossip better.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,520
Gossip, why don't you explain it a little bit just in case.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,600
Okay so if I gossip, I maybe share news or information about other people with my friends.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,680
Like I might say something like, Marco, did you see what happened in ChinesePod today?

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,920
You'll never guess what I saw.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Exactly, that's gossip.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,440
And we also have language today to describe things.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,760
To describe strange things.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Strange things.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,600
Alright so let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,160
Vocabulary preview.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,040
So in our vocabulary preview we'll look at a few important words that will help you to

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,600
understand the dialogue a little bit better.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,440
Exactly and the first word is weird.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Weird.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Weird.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Weird.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,480
Now this is a common word you probably hear all the time and in a lot of different situations.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,400
So we wanted to explain it today.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
Yeah, this word just means strange.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
It's strange.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Yeah.

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Weird person is a strange person.

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Yeah, exactly.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
But the thing about this word is if you are a young person, let's say under the age of

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,440
35, you'll probably use it about a hundred times a day.

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Weird.

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Yeah.

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,640
It's just such a good sounding word, weird.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
It is.

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,920
Okay but the thing is that even though it is probably more commonly used in American

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
English, it's still widely used for British English as well.

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
Yeah, that's true.

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,160
So but maybe in British English you would say something like...

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Odd.

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Odd.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah.

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
That's more common.

47
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Okay, let's look at our second word.

48
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,440
Housewarming gift.

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,160
Housewarming gift.

50
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,400
Housewarming gift.

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Housewarming gift.

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,520
Now this is a cultural thing.

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,920
It's really common in North America to give a housewarming gift to someone.

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,800
Yeah, if I move into a new house, maybe some of my friends or family will bring a gift

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,040
over to make my house a little bit more beautiful.

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,560
So something like a photo frame or...

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,840
Or maybe a plant or sometimes even like maybe a basket of pastries or something.

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Okay.

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Yeah.

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
I've never gotten one of those because I don't have a home.

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh.

62
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Where do you live?

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
On the street?

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, I don't have my own home so I have never gotten one of those.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,680
Okay, so we're ready now to listen to our dialogue.

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,840
So we've got two housewives who are gossiping about what's going on in the neighborhood

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,560
and let's listen to what happens.

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
Yeah, I know.

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,560
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
His name is Armand.

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Really?

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
What's he like?

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
You have to fill me in.

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
Actually, he's a bit strange.

77
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,880
I don't know.

78
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,040
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

79
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Really?

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Why?

81
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird and

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,440
then he practically kicked me out.

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,560
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
really get a good look.

85
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,560
The whole thing really creeped me out.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,800
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,640
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

88
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,640
It almost looked like a coffin.

89
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
You see?

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Why would he?

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Hello, ladies.

92
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Armand!

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,920
Oh, you scared the heck out of me.

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
This is my friend Doris.

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,400
Pleasure to meet you.

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
If you're not doing anything tonight, I'd like to have you both for dinner.

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,360
I mean, I'd like to have you both over for dinner.

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Ooh, that guy seems kind of weird.

99
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
You can hear his voice is like a weird guy, right?

100
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah.

101
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,960
All right, let's take a look at our language takeaway and look at some of these great words.

102
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Language takeaway.

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,040
So, our language takeaway focuses on several words from the dialogue that we feel are really

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
important for you to know.

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,200
Exactly, and we have four of them for you today.

106
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Why don't we look at the first one?

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,480
Okay, so the first word is a bad feeling.

108
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Bad feeling.

109
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
A bad feeling.

110
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
A bad feeling.

111
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,080
So, we've got a few examples that will help you to understand how this phrase works.

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Example one.

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I don't like Kelly's new boyfriend.

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,440
I've got a bad feeling about him.

115
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,960
Example two.

116
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,400
It's so dark.

117
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,840
We shouldn't be out here.

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,840
I've got a bad feeling about this.

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,520
Example three.

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
I've got a bad feeling about this trip.

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
I feel like something's going to happen.

122
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
Maybe we shouldn't go.

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,800
Okay, so basically you think something bad is going to happen.

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,920
Yeah, you have a sort of uncomfortable feeling.

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,280
Okay, that makes sense.

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,320
You have a bad feeling about something.

127
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Exactly.

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,440
Okay, let's look at our second word now.

129
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Kicked me out.

130
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Kicked me out.

131
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Kicked me out.

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,920
Kicked me out.

133
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,040
So when someone kicks you out, it's they force you to leave.

134
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
You don't want to leave, but they force you to.

135
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Yeah.

136
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,280
Marco, have you ever kicked someone out of your class?

137
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,960
Yes, I have.

138
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Really?

139
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,320
Yeah, if you misbehave in my class, you're kicked out.

140
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,640
So you're pretty strict, huh?

141
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,000
Sometimes I am.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,480
So maybe you've kicked your husband out of bed.

144
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,000
I might have done that once or twice before.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
We'll have to ask him.

146
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm sure he has.

147
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,760
All right, so that's what it means.

148
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,720
You force someone to leave the house, leave the class, leave the bed.

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,360
So kicked out of class, kicked out of the house, kicked out of bed.

150
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Exactly.

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Great.

152
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,520
Let's look at our third word now.

153
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
Creeped me out.

154
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,600
Creeped me out.

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
Creeped me out.

156
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,320
Creeped me out.

157
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,360
Now this is a really common phrase.

158
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,600
I like this phrase a lot, and we've got some examples for you to listen to to help you

159
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,640
understand this word a little bit better.

160
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Example one.

161
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Shh.

162
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Did you hear that?

163
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, I think I saw something.

164
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Stop it.

165
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,840
You're really creeping me out.

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Example two.

167
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,960
This place really creeps me out.

168
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Let's get out of here.

169
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
All right, well, I have a confession to make.

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm kind of creeped out by clowns.

171
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
You are?

172
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Yes.

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
I don't know.

174
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
They're just creepy.

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
They scare me.

176
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Really?

177
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Yeah.

178
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
What is it about clowns that scare you so much?

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I don't know.

180
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,960
They're just white faces and weird paint.

181
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I don't know.

182
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
It's just creepy.

183
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
And the way they laugh.

184
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I don't know.

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Maybe you had a bad experience with clowns as a child.

186
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Probably.

187
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,640
I watched a scary movie about clowns or something.

188
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah.

189
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
All right.

190
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,280
So, creeped me out basically means made me feel uncomfortable.

191
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Yes.

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
It scares you.

193
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah.

194
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:50,520
Well, speaking of being scared, we have our final word for language takeaway, and it is

195
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,120
scared the heck out of me.

196
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,480
You scared the heck out of me.

197
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Scared the heck out of me.

198
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
You got really scared.

199
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah, I think this is a quite common way of saying, you really, really scared me.

200
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Yeah.

201
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Okay.

202
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
We're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

203
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,600
Now, try and see if you can catch all these phrases that we just talked about.

204
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:19,560
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

205
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Yeah, I know.

206
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,760
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

207
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,880
His name is Armand.

208
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Really?

209
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,120
What's he like?

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,520
You have to fill me in.

211
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,760
Actually, he's a bit strange.

212
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
I don't know.

213
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

214
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Really?

215
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
Why?

216
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird,

217
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,320
and then he practically kicked me out.

218
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,880
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't

219
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,080
really get a good look.

220
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,480
The whole thing really creeped me out.

221
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

222
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:20,000
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,140
It almost looked like a coffin.

224
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,480
You see, why would he—

225
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,160
Hello, ladies.

226
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,600
Ah, Armand.

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,380
You scared the heck out of me.

228
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,080
This is my friend, Doris.

229
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,240
A pleasure to meet you.

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:54,680
I mean, I would like to have you both over for dinner.

232
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,540
You know, one of the things I really like about this dialogue is there's a lot of great

233
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,100
phrases that will help you to gossip.

234
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,640
That's a good observation.

235
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,160
So I think it's time for Fluency Builder.

236
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
Fluency Builder.

237
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,060
In Fluency Builder, we take a simple phrase or a simple word you already know and show

238
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,420
you how to express the same idea a little bit more naturally.

239
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,620
Okay, great.

240
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,820
So let's take a look at our first item for Fluency Builder.

241
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,140
So when you gossip with somebody, you often tell them news or information that they don't

242
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,740
know already.

243
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,580
And you might start by saying, did you know that?

244
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,660
Or you can say, did you hear?

245
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,180
Yeah, both of those phrases are perfectly fine, but if you want to sound a little bit

246
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,700
more native-like when you're gossiping, you might try out this phrase from the dialogue.

247
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,740
I don't know if you've heard.

248
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,860
I don't know if you've heard.

249
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,100
Yeah, that's a really good phrase.

250
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,900
You're saying exactly the same thing, but in a really natural way.

251
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,180
It's a great one for gossiping.

252
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,220
So Marco, I don't know if you've heard, but ChinesePod is up to some pretty crazy things.

253
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,660
See, that's exactly how you would use that phrase.

254
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,740
So now let's take a look at our second item.

255
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,460
Now when you're gossiping, you want information.

256
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
That's right.

257
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,140
So you might say, oh, tell me about it.

258
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,780
Or something like, give me the details.

259
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,900
Yeah, and again, both of these examples are perfectly fine, but when you're gossiping,

260
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,420
you might want to try something like this.

261
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,260
You have to fill me in.

262
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,860
You have to fill me in.

263
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,260
Fill me in, yeah, that's what I would say.

264
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,860
Fill me in, you know, give me the details.

265
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
Fill me in.

266
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,980
Fill me in on today's gossip.

267
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,380
Okay, so let's take a look at our third item.

268
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,700
Now if you have some juicy gossipy news and you want to start up a conversation, you might

269
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,460
use this phrase here.

270
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,860
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

271
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,740
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

272
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
That's a really good phrase.

273
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,060
You can change it a little bit.

274
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,180
You can say, you'll never guess who I saw.

275
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,460
Or you'll never guess what I heard.

276
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Exactly.

277
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,780
Very excellent gossip phrases.

278
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,660
We're teaching you how to gossip because that's real English.

279
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,060
People really do it, so you've got to know the language for it.

280
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,340
All right, so enough of our gossip.

281
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,180
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue one last time.

282
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:38,140
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

283
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
Yeah, I know.

284
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,060
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

285
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
His name is Armand.

286
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Really?

287
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
What's he like?

288
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
You have to fill me in.

289
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,140
Actually, he's a bit strange.

290
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
I don't know.

291
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,540
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

292
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Really?

293
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
Why?

294
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,380
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird,

295
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,980
and then he practically kicked me out.

296
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,100
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't

297
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,460
really get a good look.

298
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,140
The whole thing really creeped me out.

299
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,340
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

300
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,220
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

301
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,220
It almost looked like a coffin.

302
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
You see?

303
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Why would he?

304
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
Hello, ladies.

305
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Armand!

306
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,460
You scared the heck out of me.

307
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
This is my friend Doris.

308
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,940
A pleasure to meet you.

309
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,660
If you're not doing anything tonight, I'd like to have you both for dinner.

310
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:39,220
I mean, I'd like to have you both over for dinner.

311
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:49,020
Okay, Markle, I have a true story for you.

312
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,660
Is it kind of like a creepy story?

313
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,180
It is a creepy story indeed.

314
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Is it a true story?

315
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
No, it's really true.

316
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,620
So, when I was young, I used to live in the country.

317
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,420
And you know, in the country, all of the neighbors know each other.

318
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,820
It's a small community, so everyone knows what's happening all the time.

319
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,660
And there was some gossip going on in our community about a guy who lived at the end

320
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,180
of the road.

321
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,500
And he was the owner of a car wrecking yard.

322
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,900
So a place where you take old broken down cars and take the parts apart to sell.

323
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Right.

324
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
And anyway, a scrap yard.

325
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Yeah, a scrap yard.

326
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
All right.

327
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,220
Okay, so, you know, he had a wife and a couple of kids.

328
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,340
And suddenly his wife disappeared.

329
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
Wow.

330
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Yeah.

331
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,040
And no one knew what happened or anything.

332
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,780
And so several years pass and suddenly the police start coming in and start investigating

333
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,180
this guy and start digging up all of the land around his property.

334
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,820
And I guess, I don't know what they're doing, but I think they were looking for the wife's

335
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
body.

336
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Wow.

337
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
And did they find it?

338
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
I don't know.

339
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
I moved away.

340
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,780
Oh, such a great story, but we don't know how it ends.

341
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,780
Yeah.

342
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Well, we can leave it up to the imagination of our listeners.

343
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
Exactly.

344
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,180
Maybe they were looking for an old car.

345
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,380
An old car buried in the ground.

346
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,820
I don't think so.

347
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,940
All right.

348
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,340
That's a true story.

349
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,740
Real English, real stories.

350
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
You heard it first here on EnglishPod.

351
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
All right.

352
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,860
So, we want to hear your comments and suggestions about this topic.

353
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,380
I bet a lot of our listeners also have creepy stories, maybe ghost stories, maybe, I don't

354
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,260
know, different types of weird stories.

355
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,500
So, you guys should definitely log on to EnglishPod and share them with us.

356
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
That's right.

361
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,380
So, we want to hear all your juicy stories and gossip maybe as well.

00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,380
