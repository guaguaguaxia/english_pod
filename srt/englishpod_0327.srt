00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,680
My name is Catherine and today we're going shopping for something.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,280
What are we going shopping for, Marco?

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
That's right.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,560
Today we are buying pants and we're going to try to see if we find a good pair of jeans.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,200
Yeah, sometimes pants are too small, sometimes they're too big.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Let's try and find the right pair today.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Excuse me, can I try on this pair of jeans?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,840
Sure, let me see.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm afraid we don't have any size 8's left.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,160
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm always a size 4.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,680
Here, I'll try these.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:02,360
They seem a bit too tight.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Shall I find you a larger size?

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,640
No, they fit fine.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,280
They show off my curves perfectly.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Yeah, your love handles.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,680
They sure do, although here, you forgot to close this button.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Yeah, right.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
I'll do it now.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
All right, we're back.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:31,200
Now, let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,800
All right, so today on Language Takeaway, the first phrase we have is actually a verbal

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
phrase.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,920
This is what we do when we go to find some clothes.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,080
We try on those clothes.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
That's right.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,640
So, this is, as you said, a verbal phrase and to try on a pair of pants or to try on

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,520
some clothes is to put them on and see if they are okay, if they're the right size.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
That's right.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,840
So, if I'm in the store and I see a shirt that I really like, I go to the dressing room

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,440
to try it on.

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,320
Or you could say, oh my gosh, Marco, come here.

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
This shirt is great.

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,800
You should try it on.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
That's right.

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,960
So, you try it on or you try on something.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
All right.

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,360
So, as we said, we wanted to try on a pair of jeans.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,920
So, let's take a look at this connection of words, pair of jeans.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
All right.

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
So, you don't have a jeans.

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
You have a pair of them.

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
And this is because you have not one but two legs.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,880
So, pair means two of something.

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
That's right.

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,280
So, it doesn't mean that you have two pants, right?

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,640
It doesn't mean that you have two pieces of clothing.

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,720
It means that you have one piece of clothing that's a pair of jeans.

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
That's right.

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,480
So, you have one part for one leg and one part for another leg.

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,040
The same is true of glasses because glasses are for your two eyes.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
That's right.

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,240
So, you have a pair of glasses.

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
That's right.

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,160
A pair of glasses, a pair of shoes.

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Also.

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Okay.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,800
So, we are trying on these pair of jeans but they seem to be a bit too tight.

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
All right.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,360
So, tight is a word we use when something is too small.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,280
It's hard to move if something is too tight.

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,640
So, maybe if the pants are too small, they might be too tight.

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Yeah.

68
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,560
And we often say this especially to girls.

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,040
My mom used to say this, oh no, you're not wearing that skirt.

70
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,280
It's too tight.

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
You can see your body underneath.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,640
So, actually the opposite would be loose if something is too big.

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Too big.

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
If it's too big, it's loose.

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,160
If it's too small, it's tight.

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Okay.

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,120
Now, if it's not too big and not too small, then that means it fits.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
It fits.

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
That's right.

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,800
So, I could say, I think I want to buy this pair of jeans.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,520
It fits very well.

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,640
So, if the pants or the pair of jeans fit, it means they are okay for you.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
They're not too big, not too small.

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
They're comfortable.

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Comfortable.

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,880
And in this case, she said that they fit perfectly because they show off her curves.

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,240
Now, what is she talking about my curves?

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,560
Well, a curve is something that's not straight.

90
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
It bends.

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,200
When we're talking about a person's curves, we're talking about maybe a woman's hips or

92
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,520
her behind, her rear end or her chest.

93
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,440
And so, women who have curves maybe are rounder, not flat.

94
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Okay.

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,800
So, it's something that usually you would use with girls, right?

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
A girl has nice curves.

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,160
You wouldn't really say that for a guy, I think.

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,360
No, guys, you don't really talk about curves.

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,880
But with girls, usually you can see someone's curves if she wears tight clothes.

100
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Okay.

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Very good.

102
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,440
So, why don't we take a break?

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:08,960
Let's review all this vocab and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Excuse me.

105
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,760
Can I borrow this pair of jeans?

106
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Sure.

107
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,400
Let me see.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,520
I'm afraid we don't have any size 8s left.

109
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,720
What are you talking about?

110
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm always a size 4.

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:36,960
Here, I'll try these.

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,000
They seem a bit too tight.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Can I find you a larger size?

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,240
No, they fit fine.

115
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
They show off my curves perfectly.

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,680
Yeah, your love handles.

117
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
They sure do.

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
Although, here, you forgot to close this button.

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,760
Yeah, right.

120
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll do it now.

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,160
All right.

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,920
Now it's time for three phrases.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,200
Let's take a look at those on Fluency Builder.

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,480
All right.

125
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,000
So we heard this phrase here, I'm afraid, and it means something maybe different from

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
what you've heard before.

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,360
So the shopkeeper said, I'm afraid we don't have any size 8s left.

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
That's right.

129
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,160
So, when you start a sentence like this, you're basically apologizing a little bit, right?

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah.

131
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,360
It's like saying, I'm sorry, I don't think we have size 8s left.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,380
So maybe I go into the store and I say, well, I would like some chocolate milk, please.

133
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,840
And I say, I'm sorry, I'm afraid we ran out of chocolate milk.

134
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm afraid we ran out.

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,960
So this means it's too bad or unfortunately, we don't have any.

136
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
That's right.

137
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,880
So it's not the same being afraid like you're being, you're scared.

138
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
No, it's not that afraid.

139
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:01,160
It's a polite way for usually a shopkeeper to say, I'm sorry, we can't help you.

140
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Okay.

141
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,840
So coming back to curves, the girl used this interesting phrasal verb there, to show off.

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
All right.

143
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:17,220
So we know the word to show, but to show something off, to show off means to display or exhibit.

144
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,760
It's almost like you want other people to look at you.

145
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Okay.

146
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,560
So if, I guess maybe you can see it on the street, if someone is in their car and they're

147
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,960
playing loud music, kind of drawing attention to their car, they're kind of showing off

148
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
their car.

149
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,720
They want you to see their car or just hear how great sound system they have.

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
That's right.

151
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,120
Or some women will wear very, very short skirts because they want to show off their long legs.

152
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
That's right.

153
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
All right.

154
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,920
But now something that you don't really want to show off are your love handles.

155
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,280
All right.

156
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,760
Now this is a very funny phrase.

157
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,400
It's actually something we say in spoken English that if you say it to someone else, it might

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
be very rude.

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,760
Love handles are the part of your body above your waist that if you have a little fat,

160
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,080
it's like they're squishy.

161
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
You can touch them.

162
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Right.

163
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,880
So just think about how maybe people that are a little bit overweight, they put on a

164
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,280
pair of pants and on their sides, in their waist, the extra skin that kind of is around

165
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,880
the pants, that's called love handles.

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,480
And we say love handles because when someone hugs you or they want to hold you, that's

167
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,880
where they put their hands.

168
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,840
There's extra to hold on to.

169
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Right.

170
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,320
I think sometimes they may be called like tires or something like this.

171
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,920
Well, spare tire is in the front.

172
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,360
It's near your belly.

173
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
All right.

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
So that's called a spare tire.

175
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
That's right.

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
So a spare tire is in the front.

177
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
It's a belly.

178
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
Normally, when people drink a lot of beer, very often they have a spare tire.

179
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,680
But this is actually love handles are on the sides.

180
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,360
But that's our last word today.

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,680
Let's remember that it's not something you want to go around telling people they have,

182
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,560
but you can joke with your friends about it.

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Right.

184
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Exactly.

185
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
All right.

186
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:17,920
So let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

187
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Excuse me.

188
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Can I try on this pair of jeans?

189
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Sure.

190
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,480
Let me see.

191
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm afraid we don't have any size eights left.

192
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,800
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm always a size four.

194
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:46,000
Here, I'll try these.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,040
They seem a bit too tight.

196
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,960
Can I find you a larger size?

197
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,280
No, they fit fine.

198
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,920
They show off my curves perfectly.

199
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,720
Yeah, your love handles.

200
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
They sure do.

201
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,400
Although here, you forgot to close this button.

202
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Yeah, right.

203
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,080
I'll do it now.

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,280
All right.

205
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,400
So speaking about pants, I've noticed something that the girl asked for a size four, but she

206
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,720
really was a size eight.

207
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,000
So how does this work?

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,080
Because as guys, we don't have size fours, five or ones or anything.

209
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,440
You buy a pair of jeans, you say size 32 in the waist and size 30 in length or something

210
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
like this.

211
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
So that's right.

212
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,400
Men's clothes usually indicate the size of your waist.

213
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,600
So 32 is a 32 inch waist.

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
But women's clothes don't have those measurements.

215
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,620
And I sometimes think it would be better if we did, because it's very hard.

216
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,920
Some stores have size four, which is one size, but if you go to another store, it's very

217
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
different.

218
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,680
So you always have to try on these clothes.

219
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,960
But normally in America, the sizes go from zero, which is the very, very smallest to

220
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,160
14 or 16, which is the largest.

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Normal size for most women would be an eight, I think, an eight or a 10.

222
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,640
And now obviously this depends on the countries, because like for example, being in Asia, in

223
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,480
China, the women are usually a little bit thinner or smaller.

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,400
So it's harder, I think, for, it's harder to actually have this universal form of measurements

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
for girls.

226
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
That's right.

227
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,020
So in the back of your pants, for example, there'll usually be some fabric and it will

228
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,640
say the size according to different countries.

229
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,720
So in America, size six, in China, size, I don't know, 28.

230
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,120
And so they'll have the different numbers.

231
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,160
And UK is also a different size.

232
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,320
Kind of like your shoes.

233
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,120
If you look inside your shoe, it'll say, I think, a Japanese size, the UK size, which

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,360
is like 41, 42, and the USA size, which is like size eight or nine.

235
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,760
So, it's very, very interesting, especially when you're buying clothes, you have to remember

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,880
what size you are and you have to ask the person to, that you try it on.

237
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,640
Because some things I know you can't try on, right?

238
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,720
That's right.

239
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,000
And in some stores, you have to ask for help to take things off the racks.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,160
So it can be very difficult.

241
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,880
But normally, if you say, hey, can I try this on, the shopkeeper will help you.

242
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Okay.

243
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Great stuff.

244
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,880
