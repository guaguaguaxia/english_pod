00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
Hi guys.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
My name is Katrin and today we're talking about something that is a little bit private.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,840
That's right, but very necessary to learn in English because it's very, very useful.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
That's right.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,160
So we're talking about clothing, more specifically underwear.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,920
So the clothes you wear under your clothes.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
That's right.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,520
Okay, so let's just jump into the dialogue.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,520
Let's see what happens today and we'll be back in a bit.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,320
Lily, I found a pair of men's boxers in the laundry machine this morning.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
What?

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
That's weird.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Are they your boyfriend's?

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,520
Nah, Kevin only wears briefs.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,000
Plus, this pair is extra small.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
What do they look like?

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,560
They're light blue with thin pink stripes.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,080
Oh, and there's Snoopy on it, which is hilarious.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,640
Those are my undies.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,440
All right, so a lot of great vocab there.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,960
Let's take a look at that now on Language Takeaway.

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,060
Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,800
So the first thing we have here in Language Takeaway is actually very interesting, Marco,

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,520
because we don't say one underwear or one boxers.

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,800
We say a pair of, just like pants, a pair of pants or a pair of underwear.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,480
A pair of pants, a pair of shorts, socks.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,180
The same thing goes for underwear.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,520
So I really don't know why because it's one piece.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,840
So are pants, but basically you have two holes, two places for your legs.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,320
So anything with your legs, your socks, your shoes, your pants, your underwear, you need

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,800
a pair because you've got both sides, left and right.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Okay.

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,600
All right, so you got a pair of men's boxers.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Now before we describe the underwear part, let's take a look at this other machine, a

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
laundry machine.

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,680
Okay, so you know what a machine is.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,000
It's usually something that uses electricity to help us with a task or a job.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,520
But a laundry machine is special because it helps us clean our laundry.

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,480
What kind of things are laundry?

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,920
So anything that's your clothes.

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,680
So basically it's also called a washing machine, right?

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
So laundry machine or washing machine, same thing.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,120
It uses water and soap to wash your clothes.

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
That's right.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,440
Okay, so now let's get into the type of underwear here, specifically for men.

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
Usually we have boxers, boxer shorts.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
That's right.

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,040
So shorts means that they're not long, they're short.

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,040
So boxers or boxer shorts as you say are usually pretty loose.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,200
They're not very tight and they're longer than the other kinds of underwear we have.

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Okay, so boxers are a type of underwear that men wear under their clothes and as you say

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,720
they're pretty much shorts.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
But they're called boxers or you can call them boxer shorts.

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:10,440
Now I guess the classic or the common form of men's underwear are called briefs.

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,800
Briefs, now these are smaller than boxers and they're tighter.

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,040
And they are usually made out of some kind of material that stretches.

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
You can pull them a little bit.

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,680
And this is again a smaller version, well a smaller kind of underwear.

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
That's right.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,040
So boxers are more like shorts, briefs are kind of and briefs are not really shorts.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,040
They're more like, I guess kind of like a swimming suit.

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,120
They look like a bathing suit bottom for men.

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,680
Okay, now, that's it, right?

66
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Okay, undies.

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,240
Okay, so both these things we could actually describe as undies.

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
That's right.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,000
So undies is a common spoken language way of saying underwear.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Okay, so it's very casual and it's usually something that we say with our family or friends.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Especially moms like to say this with their kids.

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,440
Alright, honey, I'm going to buy you some new undies this week.

73
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,840
And of course, as a child, you feel very embarrassed.

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,320
Undies is a way to say underwear.

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Alright.

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,280
Okay, so that's all the vocab that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

77
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,120
Lily, I found a pair of men's boxers in the laundry machine this morning.

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
What?

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
That's weird.

81
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Are they your boyfriend's?

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,320
Nah, Kevin only wears briefs.

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,760
Plus, this pair is extra small.

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,160
What do they look like?

85
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
They're light blue with thin pink stripes.

86
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
Oh, and there's Snoopy on it, which is hilarious.

87
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Those are my undies.

88
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,400
Alright, we're back.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,040
So now let's take a look at some descriptive words in Fluency Builder.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Fluency Builder.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,880
Alright, so as you said, Marco, we have a lot of great phrases today and some words

92
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,240
for describing underwear.

93
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,980
And you can describe other things with these words as well.

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,280
The first one we have is a phrase, extra small.

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,200
Okay, so when you buy underwear, the sizes, you sometimes get small, extra small, large,

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,800
medium, but it's just a way of describing how big it is.

97
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Right, so you know the S, the M and the L are small, medium and large.

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,000
But if you see the XS, that's extra small, it means it's very small.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
Alright, we also have XL, which is extra large.

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
That's right.

101
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,240
Okay, so now that we've described the size, now we're going to describe a little

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
bit of how they look like, the colors and maybe any characteristics.

103
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,920
So the first thing that we see is the color is light blue.

104
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Okay, so we've got blue, which is normal blue.

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,520
We have light blue, which is maybe the color of the sky on a beautiful summer day.

106
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,240
There's also, we didn't hear it in today's dialogue, but there's another color, it's

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,560
dark blue, which is almost more like purple or black.

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
That's right.

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,400
So this is the way of describing a color.

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,720
Now it can be for any color except white.

111
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
You don't really say light white or dark white.

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah, you don't.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,960
So you could say light green, dark green, light orange, dark orange.

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,520
Okay, and now some characteristics.

115
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,980
They had some thin pink stripes.

116
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,680
So we have the word here thin.

117
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,880
So not fat, thin.

118
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,200
Pink we have the color, but what are stripes?

119
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Okay, stripes are a very common design for clothes and you often see stripes, they're

120
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,600
like lines.

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,520
And so that means that you have different lines that are pink.

122
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,460
You often see stripes on flags.

123
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,000
So for example, the American flag has red and white stripes.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Okay, very good.

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,680
So as you said, there are lines and yeah, usually in clothing, you can find maybe shirts

126
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,680
that have vertical stripes or sometimes even horizontal stripes.

127
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Yes, but these undies are quite unique.

128
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,920
They're very special because they have pink stripes.

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
That's right.

130
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,760
Okay, so that's all the language we have for you.

131
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:28,280
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a little bit.

132
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,640
Lily I found a pair of men's boxers in the laundry machine this morning.

133
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
What?

134
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
That's weird.

135
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Are they your boyfriend's?

136
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,920
Nah, Kevin only wears briefs.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,280
Plus this pair is extra small.

138
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,680
What do they look like?

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,760
They're light blue with thin pink stripes.

140
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Oh, and there's Snoopy on it, which is hilarious.

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,600
Those are my undies.

142
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,640
All right, so in this case, we're talking about men's boxer shorts because there was

143
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,760
a confusion about the boyfriend.

144
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,920
But women also wear boxer shorts.

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,720
It's very popular now among women.

146
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
Yeah, it is.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,040
It's usually something that women wear over their underwear.

148
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,600
Women don't really wear boxer shorts as underwear.

149
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Women's underwear is smaller.

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,840
It's like men's briefs.

151
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,720
Okay, so if a girl wears boxers and it's usually for maybe if they're just around the house

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
and you don't want to wear pants and you don't want to wear shorts, you can just wear a pair

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,800
of comfortable boxer shorts.

154
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,320
Exactly, like they wear pajamas.

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,440
And actually, I think a lot of girls also use boxer shorts as pajamas, right?

156
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
That's right.

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,240
They're comfortable and they're light and they're usually made from cotton, which is

158
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
a nice material to sleep in.

159
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,640
Now when we're talking about briefs, there is also another way that I've heard that they're

160
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,960
called sometimes, a more maybe funny way of calling them.

161
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,360
Some people say they're called tidy whities.

162
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
That's right.

163
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,480
This is usually something we say to joke because in America, at least, many men like to wear,

164
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,560
young men like to wear boxers.

165
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,400
So they call briefs tidy whities.

166
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,240
Because usually, briefs are just white.

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
They're plain.

168
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,840
They don't have any design or any other color.

169
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,320
No, they're plain and they're white usually or gray and they're tight, not like boxers.

170
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,120
So the casual name, this is not something you want to say to your English teacher, by

171
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
the way.

172
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,360
The casual name or the funny name is tidy whities.

173
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Tidy whities.

174
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,240
Actually, this is very interesting because with newer generations, I think men are wearing

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,920
boxers instead of briefs.

176
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,520
Before, I think the only option was briefs.

177
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,360
But now boxers have grown more and more popular and I think when you're a little kid, your

178
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,760
mom always buys you little briefs and everything.

179
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,680
But then when you're a teenager, I think you just switch over to boxers.

180
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,520
It's not as cool anymore to wear briefs.

181
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,760
I think it's the whole fact of how kids sometimes dress with saggy or baggy pants and so they

182
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,920
like to show their boxers underneath for some reason.

183
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,360
I don't really understand it.

184
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,640
But if you do, let us know.
