00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,720
And today we're bringing you the next part of our suspense series, The New Guy in Town.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,720
That's right.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,440
So we know that Armando wasn't really a vampire, that he was just acting.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,400
And the women aren't quite what they seem in this dialogue.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,240
In the last one, something happened and she transformed into some sort of, I don't know,

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
creature, right?

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Like monster.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Right.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,580
So now let's see what happens.

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,400
So we're not going to preview any vocabulary this time.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,040
Let's just listen to the dialogue and see what happens.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:47,520
What the heck is going on?

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
Did you see that?

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
What was that thing?

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
I don't know.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm just glad we made it out.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Look, there's a police car.

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Help!

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Help!

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Please, please stop!

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Howdy, ma'am.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,960
What seems to be the problem?

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
Is this man bothering you?

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,160
Officer, officer.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,740
There is like a witch creature back there.

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,000
We tied her up, but she broke free and she was about to have us for dinner.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay, calm down.

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
Calm down.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
Let me see your eyes, please.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,720
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,920
We're telling the truth.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
She's in there.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,360
We suspected her being a kidnapper or a rapist, but it turns out she's an alien or something.

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,160
Okay, calm down.

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Calm down.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,640
Let me see your eyes, please.

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Seriously.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,320
Are you going to help us out or not?

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Okay.

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Let's go have a look, shall we?

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:15,920
Hello?

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,080
Is anyone in there?

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Be careful.

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:31,200
She might be hiding.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,480
It's perfectly safe.

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:03:01,480
There isn't anyone.

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,040
I don't think things are turning out very well for our housewives and Armand.

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,960
Apparently, the police officer is not going to make it to the next episode.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Uh-oh.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
All right.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,200
So, we saw some really great vocabulary and even though it's kind of a scary story, there

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
is a lot of things we can learn.

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
So why don't we take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Language Takeaway.

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Well, we're going to look at five words and phrases here and the first one, they described

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,720
this woman as a kind of creature.

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Creature.

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Creature.

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
All right.

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,360
So, what exactly is a creature?

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680
Well, a creature can be any animal.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Any animal?

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Yeah, like from a mouse to a bird to an insect or a bug.

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,840
So I can say a bird is a flying creature.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Exactly.

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
All right.

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,360
You can also use it to mean an unknown and scary animal.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
So there's a creature under my bed.

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Yes.

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,960
Or some type of creature was attacking me.

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Okay.

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,080
So, a creature can be any sort of living thing or animal.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Exactly.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Yep.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
All right.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
What about our next one?

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Well, the creature broke free from some ropes.

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
All right.

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,560
So, to break free.

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Break free.

84
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Uh-huh.

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
And what does that mean?

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,640
When you break free, you escape from something that stops you moving.

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Okay.

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,160
So, you have the ability to move again.

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Yes.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
You break free from maybe ropes.

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
Or chains.

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,280
Or even a relationship.

93
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Okay.

94
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
So, I can say, oh, I finally broke free from that awful relationship.

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,520
Now, that's quite interesting the way we can use this in different ways.

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,680
So why don't we take a look at some examples now?

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,200
Example one.

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Somebody tied up the dog, but he is trying to break free.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,160
Example two.

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm glad that I broke free from that horrible relationship.

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,800
Example three.

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,520
I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities.

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Okay.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
So break free, it's clear now.

106
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
So why don't we move on to our next word?

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,800
They thought that maybe this creature was a kidnapper.

109
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Kidnapper.

110
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Kidnapper.

111
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Okay.

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
So this is?

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
A criminal.

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
So, a kidnapper is a criminal.

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Yep.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
All right.

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
And what exactly does a kidnapper do?

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,960
A kidnapper takes someone to a place and keeps them there against their will.

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Against their will.

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
With force or violence.

121
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
All right.

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,200
So, I guess that makes sense, right?

123
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,920
Because the word has kid in it.

124
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah.

125
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
So, it can take children.

126
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Yes.

127
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,600
But it can be also, you can kidnap an adult.

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Yes, that's true.

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
All right.

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,120
So, this word can actually be used in three different ways.

131
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,160
So we saw a kidnapper, right?

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
Okay, that is the person.

133
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah.

134
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,240
And the verb, to kidnap.

135
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,400
Okay.

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,160
Or a noun describing an action, a kidnapping.

137
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
A kidnapping.

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Very good.

139
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Yeah, a kidnapping took place today.

140
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Okay.

141
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,520
So, very interesting word.

142
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,320
And of course, it's illegal to be a kidnapper.

143
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Yes.

144
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,400
But this word is also very serious and it's also a crime, right?

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
That's right.

146
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
A rapist.

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
A rapist.

148
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
A rapist.

149
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Okay.

150
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
So, that is a person that...

151
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,680
Who forces someone to have sex.

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Okay.

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
So, again, against their will.

154
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Right.

155
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Like a kidnapper.

156
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Exactly.

157
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Okay.

158
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
And the verb would be...

159
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
To rape.

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
To rape.

161
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
To rape someone.

162
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Okay.

163
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,440
So, on the lighter side, we heard the police officer say something in a very strange way.

164
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,840
He said, let me see your eyes, please.

165
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Okay.

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,640
And this is an interesting phrase.

167
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a sound made from pushing two words together.

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, let me.

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,880
Why don't we hear a few more examples of this and see if we can figure out what are the

171
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,320
two words.

172
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,040
Example one.

173
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,520
Let me have a look inside the car.

174
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,760
Example two.

175
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,600
Let me go out tonight, dad.

176
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,720
Example three.

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,760
Let me think about it and I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

178
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,520
So, basically, let me is...

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Let me.

180
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Let me.

181
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Yeah.

182
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,720
Let me have that pen.

183
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Okay.

184
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Let me see.

185
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Now, we do this also with other words, right?

186
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah.

187
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Another example would be give me.

188
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Give me.

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Yeah.

190
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Give me.

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Exactly.

192
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Okay.

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
So, an interesting thing.

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
It's not proper English, right?

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
No.

196
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You wouldn't really write it this way.

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,840
Or find it in the dictionary.

198
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,280
But it's really common when people speak.

199
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,720
And actually, it's more likely that you'll say let me, give me, than let me, give me.

200
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Okay.

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Very good.

202
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,640
So, I think now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

203
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:17,240
And then we'll come back and look at some other phrases that we saw in our dialogue.

204
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
What the heck is going on?

205
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,720
Did you see that?

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,280
What was that thing?

207
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,160
I don't know.

208
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,360
I'm just glad we made it out.

209
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,640
Look, there's a police car.

210
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Help!

211
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Help!

212
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Please stop.

213
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,460
Howdy, ma'am.

214
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,260
What seems to be the problem?

215
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,600
Is this man bothering you?

216
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Officer!

217
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,080
Officer!

218
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,500
There is like a witch creature back there.

219
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,280
We tied her up, but she broke free.

220
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,000
And she was about to have us for dinner.

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Calm down.

223
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,360
Calm down.

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,480
Let me see your eyes, please.

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,000
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
We are telling the truth.

227
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
She's in there.

228
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:09,840
We suspected her of being a kidnapper or rapist, but it turns out she's an alien or something.

229
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay.

230
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
Calm down.

231
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
Calm down.

232
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
Let me see your eyes, please.

233
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,720
Seriously.

234
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,600
Are you going to help us or not?

235
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Okay.

236
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Let's go have a look, shall we?

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,280
Hello?

238
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
Is anyone in here?

239
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
Be careful.

240
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
She might be hiding.

241
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
It's perfectly safe.

242
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
There isn't anyone.

243
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,760
We're going to look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder that you might hear when you're

244
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
talking about a crime.

245
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,880
Fluency Builder.

246
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,000
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is, what the heck is going on?

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,540
What the heck is going on?

248
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,920
What the heck is going on?

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Okay.

250
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,360
So this is just asking what's happening, right?

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Right.

252
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,640
So this is a very strong way of saying what's happening.

253
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Yeah.

254
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
What really is happening?

255
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Uh-huh.

256
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,480
Now, why do they say, what the heck?

257
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
What is heck?

258
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
Well, heck is sort of a polite way of saying hell.

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Okay.

260
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
So instead of saying, what the hell is going on?

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What the heck is going on?

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Now, why do you do this?

263
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Because especially in American English, we don't like to talk about religious words.

264
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,080
So like hell and God and Jesus, these things are impolite in American English.

265
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Right.

266
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
You don't want to offend anyone.

267
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,520
That's why we would have other words like, oh my gosh.

268
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,720
For oh my God.

269
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,400
Or geez.

270
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Instead of Jesus.

271
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Right.

272
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Okay.

273
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,120
So that is an interesting thing and of course, it is a little bit of a sensitive topic among

274
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
some people.

275
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,280
So that's why it's better to just use these synonyms.

276
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Yes.

277
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,400
Okay.

278
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,880
And what about our next phrase?

279
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,280
So they suspected her of being a kidnapper.

280
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay.

281
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,480
So suspected her of being a kidnapper.

282
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Yeah.

283
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,960
So I suspect someone of being something.

284
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,880
So I suspect she is an alien.

285
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Right.

286
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,840
I suspect him of being a liar.

287
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Okay.

288
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
So what about to suspect?

289
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,280
What does that mean exactly?

290
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,160
To think something that is true, but not be 100% sure.

291
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,680
So you can say, I think she is a kidnapper.

292
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Yep.

293
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,960
Oh, I suspect her of being a kidnapper.

294
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Interesting.

295
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,560
Why don't we hear a few more examples?

296
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,440
Example one.

297
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,320
The police suspected him of being a bank robber.

298
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,800
Example two.

299
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,560
We suspect our dog is responsible for this mess.

300
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,760
Example three.

301
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,080
The neighborhood suspected that our neighbor was selling drugs.

302
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,720
All right.

303
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Very good.

304
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
So we've seen a lot of vocab.

305
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,200
We've seen these phrases.

306
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,960
So I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time, and then we'll

307
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,920
come back and talk a little bit more.

308
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,360
What the heck is going on?

309
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,880
Did you see that?

310
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,600
What was that thing?

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I don't know.

312
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm just glad we made it out.

313
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,720
Look, there's a police car.

314
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Help!

315
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Help!

316
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,760
Please, please stop!

317
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,080
Howdy, ma'am.

318
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,880
What, uh, seems to be the problem?

319
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,600
Is this man bothering you?

320
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,080
Officer, officer.

321
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,640
There is, like, a witch creature back there.

322
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,000
We tied her up, but she broke free, and she was about to have us for dinner.

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,760
Okay, calm down, calm down.

324
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Let me see your eyes, please.

325
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,640
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

326
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,840
We're telling the truth.

327
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
She's in there.

328
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,040
We suspected her being a kidnapper or a rapist, but turns out she's an alien or something.

329
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,080
Okay, calm down, calm down.

330
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,760
Let me see your eyes, please.

331
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Ugh, seriously.

332
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,080
Are you going to help us out or not?

333
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay.

334
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Let's go have a look, shall we?

335
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,680
Hello?

336
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:44,040
Is anyone in there?

337
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,920
Be careful!

338
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:58,040
She might be hiding!

339
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,360
It's perfectly safe.

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
There isn't anyone.

341
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:21,200
You're mil Taking too long.

342
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Okay, well, Marco, we're coming near the end of this series, aren't we?

343
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Yes, exactly.

344
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,080
It's a short series, but what do you think happens or how do you think the series ends?

345
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,120
What is really going on?

346
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,140
A mystery here at EnglishPod.

347
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,660
So we want to hear from you.

348
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,040
What do you think is going to happen?

349
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Exactly.

350
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,760
You can find it at EnglishPod.com where you can leave us your questions, your comments,

351
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,680

352
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
like to hear.

353
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
That's right.

354
