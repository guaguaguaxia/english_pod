00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,560
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,240
And today we have a very exciting elementary lesson for you.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
That's right.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,840
We are going to take our clothes to the dry cleaners.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
Okay.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,800
So that means we have some dirty clothes.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,080
They need to be cleaned.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,560
Let's listen to this dialogue one time and when we come back, we'll be talking about

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:34,760
the words and phrases that you hear in it.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,320
Thank God you're open.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
I have an emergency.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Hello Mr. Henderson.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,440
What can I do for you?

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,360
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,440
Okay.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
I can have it ready by the end of the week.

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
No, you don't understand.

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,200
I need this tomorrow morning.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,880
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,280
She's going to kill me.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Okay.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,760
I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,960
But this suit is also very stained.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,520
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Fine.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,240
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Certainly.

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Great.

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
This is our secret.

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,560
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Alright we're back.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,520
Now there are probably a couple of words that you didn't understand so why don't we look

35
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,200
at those now in Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,760
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,160
Marco, you already told our listeners about one phrase, to dry clean.

38
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,080
So dry cleaned.

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,960
Alright so that's when you take your clothes to a professional who doesn't only wash them,

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
right?

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,520
You don't just put water and soap on it.

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,680
They actually put some special chemicals and use special machines to get very hard to remove

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
stains from it.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Exactly.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,800
So this is often what we use when we clean coats or fancy shirts and dresses because

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,360
you don't want to clean those yourself.

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Right.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
You can't put those in the washing machine.

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
No.

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
So this is the dry cleaner.

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,800
That's the name of the place.

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,080
And the action, what they do is they dry clean clothes.

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Okay.

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Very good.

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Alright.

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,640
So we take them to the dry cleaners because we want to remove stains.

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Okay.

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,400
So a stain is a mark or some color that does not come off, does not go away.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Alright.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,560
So for example, sometimes you can have a wine stain.

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Oh, wine stains are the worst.

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,000
They're red and they never come off.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Or blood stain.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Or blood stain.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Right.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,240
So a stain is a noun but you can also use it as an adjective.

68
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
My shirt is stained.

69
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Okay.

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
So it's stained.

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,080
My pants are stained and I can't wear them again.

72
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,840
Again, you can also use it as a verb.

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
I stained my pants.

74
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Alright.

75
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,080
So it's a verb, it's a noun and an adjective all in one.

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Easy to remember.

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,920
Well, there's another word that's related to this word.

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,160
We spilled something.

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Okay.

80
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,480
So I spilled wine and it stained my shirt.

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Okay.

82
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,720
So to spill and that means that you took some liquid and you put it onto your clothes.

83
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Or you dropped it and it made a mess.

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Okay.

85
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
So spill.

86
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
I spilled some milk.

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Okay.

88
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Spilled.

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,880
Now it's pronounced differently from spell, right?

90
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
That's right.

91
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Spill.

92
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
It has an I, spilled.

93
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Alright.

94
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,800
Now our next word is also a noun and a verb.

95
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,920
To iron.

96
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,720
To iron means to make something flat with no lines.

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Okay.

98
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
To smooth it out.

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,320
So we use an iron to iron.

100
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Exactly.

101
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,240
It's a metal electronic object.

102
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
It gets very hot.

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,800
So you wash your shirts for example and your shirts are wrinkled because you just washed

104
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
them.

105
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,280
So you need to iron them.

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
That's right.

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,080
So you smooth them out, you flatten them with this object, an iron.

108
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Okay.

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,280
And well, usually if you take them to the dry cleaners, they will iron them and also

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
starch them.

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Okay.

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:12,680
To starch something means to use some powder or chemical to make something stiff or hard.

113
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,920
So the noun or the chemical is also called starch.

114
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Exactly.

115
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,520
So you think of a shirt with many buttons that a man wears to work.

116
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,760
He has a collar around his neck and that needs to be high and tall.

117
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,800
It can't be flat and wrinkled.

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,320
And so a dry cleaner will use starch to make sure that this stands up.

119
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Okay.

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Very good.

121
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,360
So those are five key words for the dialogue today.

122
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,800
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Thank God you're open.

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
I have an emergency.

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Hello, Mr. Henderson.

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,280
What can I do for you?

127
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,800
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP.

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

129
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,200
I can have it ready by the end of the week.

130
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
No, you don't understand.

131
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,040
I need this tomorrow morning.

132
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,840
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

133
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
She's going to kill me.

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Okay.

135
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,800
I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,240
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

137
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Fine.

138
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

139
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Certainly.

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Great.

141
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
This is our secret.

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,320
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.

143
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
All right.

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
We're back now.

145
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,080
So let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Thank God.

147
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Thank God.

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
All right.

149
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
What is this phrase?

150
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Thank God.

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Okay.

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,440
This is a phrase we use in English to say that we're happy about something or that we're

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
relieved.

154
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Okay.

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,760
So maybe I'm nervous that the mail isn't going to come today.

156
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,680
Then the mail comes and I say, oh, thank God the mail came.

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Yeah.

158
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
I'm happy.

159
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I was hoping it would come.

160
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
So you're relieved.

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Thank God.

162
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,760
Now, we are using the word there, God, but it doesn't really have a religious connotation

163
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
that much, right?

164
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Not anymore.

165
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
No.

166
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
It's usually just a phrase.

167
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Exactly.

168
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Okay.

169
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,200
Now what about this acronym ASAP or ASAP?

170
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
ASAP.

171
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,160
So as soon as possible.

172
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,960
It's an acronym.

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
So the first letter comes from the word.

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,320
It means as soon as possible, very quickly, right away.

175
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,560
You always hear that in an office setting as well.

176
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,880
I need those papers ASAP.

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,360
I need those reports ASAP.

178
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Exactly.

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,680
So you can say it either way, ASAP or ASAP and it means immediately.

180
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
Okay.

181
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,160
And he said that he needed the suit ASAP and he said, I can have it ready by the end of

182
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
the week.

183
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,080
Okay, so that might not be fast enough for the client, for the person here who has the

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,800
stain, but the end of the week is a very, very useful phrase because it means that maybe

185
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,840
today's Monday or Tuesday, by Friday or Saturday, we'll have this ready for you.

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,480
Because we think of the end of the week as Friday, maybe Thursday, Friday.

187
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,120
So I can say the end of the week or the end of the day.

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Exactly.

189
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
The end of the month.

190
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Or the end of the year.

191
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Exactly.

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,640
So the end of is usually the last time.

193
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,840
So thank goodness it's the end of the week.

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm ready for my weekend.

195
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Very good.

196
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Okay.

197
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
So great phrases there as well.

198
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

199
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Thank God you are open.

200
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
I have an emergency.

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Hello Mr. Henderson.

202
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
What can I do for you?

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,080
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP.

204
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Okay.

205
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I can have it ready by the end of the week.

206
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
No, you don't understand.

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,960
I need this tomorrow morning.

208
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,720
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

209
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,080
She's going to kill me.

210
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Okay.

211
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,680
I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

212
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

213
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Fine.

214
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,920
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

215
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Certainly.

216
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Great.

217
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
This is our secret.

218
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:26,080
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.

219
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
All right, we're back.

220
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,040
So now dry cleaning, ironing.

221
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,200
Are you good at this or do you get a lot of your clothes dry cleaned?

222
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,480
I'm pretty good at this actually.

223
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,920
I don't like to wash clothes.

224
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,880
I get really bored with the washing machine, but I actually really like ironing.

225
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Really?

226
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah.

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I find it very relaxing.

228
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Really?

229
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,160
I find it very frustrating.

230
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Really?

231
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Why is that?

232
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,440
Because I can't really iron well because I start on one side and I'm getting all the

233
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,760
lines out and then the other side gets wrinkled or lines appear where I don't want them to

234
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
appear.

235
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
It's very frustrating for me.

236
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
It is frustrating.

237
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,840
It takes some practice.

238
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,320
My suggestion is to use the spritzer.

239
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,240
In the iron, there's some water that can come out like that.

240
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Well, if you spray the water, it makes the lines go out for longer.

241
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,960
Because if you iron over that, it's more permanent.

242
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,400
I've also seen some sprays sometimes that you can spray your clothes with some special

243
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,360
chemical that's not actually starch, but it helps remove the wrinkles quicker.

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Exactly.

245
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
I don't use that.

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
I use water generally, but they're all available.

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
All right.

248
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,400
So that's all the time we have for today.
