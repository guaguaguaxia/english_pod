00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,360
My name is Catherine and today we have a very painful lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
That's right.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,640
Today we're going to go to one of the worst places for me.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,200
We're going to go to the dentist.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,600
Okay, so the person in this dialogue has a pain in their mouth, in the tooth area.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,240
So let's take a listen to this dialogue and when we come back, we'll be talking a little

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,240
bit more about it.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,080
What seems to be the problem?

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,760
I have a really bad toothache.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,480
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Let's have a look.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
This doesn't look too good.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,880
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you're experiencing so

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
much pain.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,600
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,040
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,640
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,560
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,120
It could be that or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:25,680
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Alright we're back and obviously we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab related to

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,160
going to the dentist and experiencing a little bit of pain.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,440
So let's take a look at that in Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,140
First up in Language Takeaway today we have the root of the problem.

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,520
It's a toothache.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right, we have a really bad toothache.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,880
Okay well ache means pain or soreness and tooth is your tooth.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,340
So I could say, oh gosh I have a really bad toothache.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,040
That's right, that means your tooth or your teeth hurt.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
And basically you can combine it like a stomachache or headache.

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Backache.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Backache.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
That's right.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,520
So usually when you have a toothache, you experience different symptoms, different things

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,760
happen to you.

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,120
What's one of these things Marco?

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,280
Well in this case the girl had a swollen cheek.

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
Her cheek is swollen.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,240
So the cheek is the side of the face.

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,240
It's usually where it's a little bit pink and when your cheek is swollen, it looks puffy.

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,200
It looks bigger than normal.

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
That's right.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
So for example sometimes you fall and you hurt your finger and it'll get fat and it'll

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
get puffy as you say.

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
It's swollen.

49
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
That's right.

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,320
So anything can be swollen really.

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,600
When you hit your toe on something hard and your toe later gets bigger, it's swollen.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,640
That's right.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,160
So obviously her cheek is swollen and she has a toothache because apparently her wisdom

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
teeth or her wisdom tooth is coming out.

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
All right.

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,200
So wisdom teeth are special teeth.

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,280
I don't know if they actually have anything to do with wisdom which means being smart.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
To be wise.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Wise.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,160
But wisdom teeth are those four teeth in the very, very, very back of your mouth.

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
That's right.

62
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,600
So these are the last teeth that come in or the last teeth that grow in your mouth.

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,760
So I think usually you're 18 or 20 when they come in.

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
That's right.

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,680
A lot of people experience these when they're older.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,600
Maybe that's why they call them wisdom teeth because you're older and you're wiser.

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,800
I had them when I was about 14, 13.

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
I was very young.

69
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,040
But these come in the very back.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
They're the furthest away from your lips.

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Okay.

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Very good.

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,840
So when they come in, sometimes there's not enough space and so they start to press against

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,120
the other teeth in your mouth, specifically against your molars.

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,600
So molars are other teeth.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,680
These are also in the back of your mouth.

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,160
You can tell which ones are molars I believe because they're flat on top.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,360
They look like a little square.

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,480
Those are the ones that you use to chew your food with mostly.

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Exactly.

81
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,160
They're not pointy like your front teeth.

82
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,640
And so molars are in the back of your mouth.

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,360
Wisdom teeth are in the very back of your mouth.

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
And molars can be very sore when the wisdom teeth push against them.

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,080
And so in this case, you will have to take your teeth out or the dentist will take your

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
teeth out.

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,200
But what's something we say when we talk about taking the whole tooth out?

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,280
Well, in this case, he's going to extract the tooth, but also he's going to extract

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,640
the nerve and the root.

90
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Okay.

91
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,640
So nerves are parts of our bodies.

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,300
We can't see them, but they help us feel things.

93
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,400
So maybe when someone hits me, the nerves in my arm, they tell my brain that it hurts.

94
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Well, we also have nerves in our teeth and that's what we're talking about here.

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,000
But what's this other thing?

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,760
You talked about the nerve and the root.

97
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,840
It's very similar to a plant, for example.

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,760
You consider that your teeth are like plants and they have little roots that go into your

99
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,440
gums.

100
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,200
And this is how basically you get teeth stay alive.

101
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,920
They are fed basically by your body.

102
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
All right.

103
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,520
So root, like with a tree or a plant, is the very bottom of something.

104
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,680
And in this case, to extract means to take out or to take away.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,920
So the dentist will have to extract the root and the nerve.

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,160
So that sounds pretty painful.

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
It's painful, but they have to do it, right?

108
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,640
So when the dentist has to extract the tooth, in this case, the nerve and the root and everything,

109
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,760
in order for you not to feel it, he gives you special drugs.

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
What are these drugs called?

111
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
These are called anesthetics.

112
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Okay.

113
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,560
So most people, when they are having major surgery, they get anesthetics so that they

114
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
can't feel anything.

115
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,880
Remember, we were just talking about nerves.

116
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,280
Well, anesthetics make it so that you can't feel things through your nerves.

117
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
That's right.

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
So obviously you don't want to feel the pain when somebody's pulling that tooth out of

119
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
your mouth.

120
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,080
So you get an anesthetic and then you don't really feel anything.

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
You kind of feel something, but you don't really feel pain.

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Exactly.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,800
So anesthetic basically makes you numb.

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Numb.

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
That's right.

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
That's the word, numb.

127
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Okay.

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,880
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab, molars, wisdom teeth, etc.

129
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:16,840
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,600
What seems to be the problem?

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,260
I have a really bad toothache.

132
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,000
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Let's have a look.

134
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,840
Hmm, this doesn't look too good.

135
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

136
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,400
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you're experiencing so

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
much pain.

138
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,120
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

139
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,600
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,320
I also noticed a small cavity up front here.

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,160
So you are going to need a filling.

142
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,080
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

143
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,320
It could be that.

144
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
Or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

145
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,440
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

146
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,180
Alright, so the topic of today's lesson is toothache but it's also basically about learning

147
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,640
that you will have to have your tooth taken out.

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,200
So to say this we say, to pull out a tooth.

149
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay, so that's what the dentist said.

150
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,720
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Not good news.

152
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,400
Okay, so to pull out means to extract.

153
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,840
So just remember here this is a phrase that has pull out.

154
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,600
Out would be the preposition here.

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,240
We wouldn't say pull off or pull at.

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
We'd say pull out.

157
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,600
Like for example, you can pull out a hair or your hair.

158
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Exactly.

159
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,840
Okay, so we're pulling out the wisdom tooth and the dentist first wants to take some x-rays

160
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
to see what we're dealing with.

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,920
Okay, so to deal with something means to work on it or to have something to do with.

162
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,240
And so in this case the dentist wants to know, is this serious?

163
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
What are we dealing with here?

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
That's right.

165
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,200
So he's trying to judge the situation.

166
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,840
So maybe what would be another scenario or another situation where you would say, I have

167
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,480
to see what we're dealing with.

168
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,920
Well, in the case of the weather and the newsmen who report about the weather, maybe they see

169
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,240
that a storm is coming but they have to look at the radars and the computer screens to

170
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
see what they're dealing with.

171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,240
Is it a serious storm or is it a very weak storm?

172
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
They have to evaluate.

173
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
That's right.

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Okay, very good.

175
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
And so we're going to see what we're dealing with.

176
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,640
And then the girl I think knows that she hasn't really taken good care of her teeth.

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,340
And so she says, I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth.

178
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,880
So that's what you get or that's what I get.

179
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Where the pronoun changes, I, you, he, that's what I get for not taking care of myself.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,280
This means it's my fault.

181
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I deserved it.

182
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
I deserve this thing.

183
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,000
So I could say, Marco, that's what you get for not doing your homework.

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You got a bad grade on your test.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's right.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,940
So it's basically a way of saying, that's what you deserve.

187
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,080
That's the consequence for your actions.

188
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Exactly.

189
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Okay.

190
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
And what about our last phrase?

191
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,880
This is something that I hate to hear from doctors and dentists because usually it's

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
a lie.

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,720
A dentist will say before he gives you a shot or before he takes your tooth out, you won't

194
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
feel a thing.

195
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
That's right.

196
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,660
So he's basically saying you're not going to feel any pain.

197
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,760
But why do we say you won't feel a thing instead of you won't feel anything?

198
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Just a set phrase.

199
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,720
It's something we say, I would remember it like this because it's more likely to be said

200
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
in this way.

201
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
You won't feel a thing.

202
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,560
I think it basically means not even one little thing, you're not going to feel that.

203
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,160
So for example, I'm about to fix someone's back, you know, when you have to pull them

204
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
and make their back feel better.

205
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,400
I say, you won't feel a thing.

206
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
You fix their back.

207
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Okay.

208
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,440
So you won't feel a thing or you won't feel anything.

209
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Both are correct, but I think it's more common to hear you won't feel a thing.

210
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Okay.

211
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
So why don't we go back?

212
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Let's take one last look at our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

213
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
What seems to be the problem?

214
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,840
I have a really bad toothache.

215
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,560
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
Let's have a look.

217
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,800
Hmm.

218
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,440
This doesn't look too good.

219
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,560
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

220
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,000
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you're experiencing so

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
much pain.

222
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,720
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

223
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,160
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

224
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,760
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

225
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,660
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

226
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,920
It could be that.

227
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
Or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

228
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,520
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

229
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,640
All right so talking about dentists and talking about wisdom teeth, you say that you still

230
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,080
have all four wisdom teeth.

231
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
I do.

232
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
They're all still back there.

233
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,160
So you didn't need to have them taken out or pulled?

234
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,680
No, as my dentist likes to say, I have a big mouth.

235
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
Which in English has two meanings.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,720
A big mouth is not just a large mouth, but also it means you like to talk a lot.

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Right.

238
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,520
So, but did you ever have braces for example when you were a kid?

239
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Oh yes.

240
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Oh you had braces.

241
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,960
I had a retainer, which is a device that you, it looks like a line across your teeth and

242
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,280
you put it in usually at night, but sometimes during the day and it makes some space in

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
your mouth.

244
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,640
But I also had braces after that.

245
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I hated braces.

246
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,840
I had them for two years.

247
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,340
Why did you hate braces?

248
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
Because they're uncomfortable.

249
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,480
Well, they don't look very good, especially when you're a 13 year old girl and you want

250
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,840
to look cute and you have this big metal thing in your mouth.

251
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
That's right.

252
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Did you have braces?

253
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
No, no, I never had braces.

254
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,960
Actually it was kind of for a while, I think a lot of people thought it was cool to have

255
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
braces.

256
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I did not grow up where you grew up.

257
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,880
It was not cool where I grew up.

258
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
I don't know.

259
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,560
I think, or it gets to a point where in certain parts, I guess my school was filled with kids

260
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
that had braces.

261
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
So I guess everyone just had really bad teeth.

262
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,440
So obviously the people that didn't have braces kind of were left aside.

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,000
So you're like, oh, I want braces.

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,560
I want to be part of the group.

265
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,640
I know sometimes I wish I had glasses, because everyone I know has glasses.

266
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Really?

267
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Yeah.

268
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
If you have good vision though.

269
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,040
Yeah, it sucks to be perfect, right?

270
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,960
Well, this is a really interesting topic and going to the dentist is always complicated.

271
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,880
Maybe some of our listeners are dentists themselves or they have some stories that they can share

272
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
with us.

273
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,800
Please let us know what you're thinking and share your dentist stories with us on EnglishPod.com.

274
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,120
We'll be waiting for you there.

275
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
All right.

276
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
We'll see you guys then.

277
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Bye.

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Bye.
