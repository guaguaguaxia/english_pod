00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Katherine and today we're talking about fear.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
That's right.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,560
Today we're going to talk about phobias, different types of fears that you have.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,640
Many people are scared of different things and that's what we're going to talk about

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
today.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,040
Okay, so let's listen to today's dialogue and find out what the people in our dialogue

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,880
are very, very afraid of.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
Are you excited about your trip next month?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,640
Yes and no.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,240
I can't wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I'm terrified.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Why?

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,440
Well, I have aerophobia.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,640
I have a chronic fear of flying.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,320
Oh really?

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,640
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,720
It's not that bad though.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,520
I mean, it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,400
miles per hour.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,880
I actually have arachnophobia.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,960
You're scared of spiders?

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,960
I actually have two more phobias, acrophobia and glossophobia.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,440
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,040
When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,880
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,040
Well, I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400
We are such weirdos, right?

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:43,520
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at those phobias on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,400
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,200
The first phobia that we have is called aerophobia.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,040
That's right, aerophobia.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,120
That means that you are scared of flying.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,320
We can tell because phobia means fear of something, but it's not just a fear.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,920
It means that if you go on an airplane, you get very, very upset.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,800
You think that you're going to die.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,280
Phobia is a very serious fear, but aero, like aeroplane, is the prefix.

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,360
Phobia is a fear of going on airplanes.

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
That's right.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Another phobia that we have is arachnophobia.

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,080
Again, as you see in the prefix, arachno is related to a spider.

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
That's right.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,560
This comes from the origins of English.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,120
I'm not sure if it's Greek or Latin, but arachnophobia, like arachnid, has to do with spiders.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm afraid of spiders if I have arachnophobia.

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,160
That is right.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,280
Now taking a look at two more types of phobias here, we have acrophobia and glossophobia.

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
Let's take a look at the first one, acrophobia.

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,440
Acrophobia has to do with heights.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't like to be on tall buildings.

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,320
I don't like to maybe look down from heights.

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,720
That means I'm afraid of heights.

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
That's right.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,200
You're afraid of being at a very high altitude, acrophobia.

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,720
Now glossophobia is an interesting one because this one, you are scared of public speaking

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,840
or you get very nervous when you're in front of a group of people.

59
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Right.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,040
So this is actually a very, very common fear, but if it's a serious fear, it's a phobia.

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,760
So glossophobia means that when you go in front of people, you get very, very anxious,

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
upset, your stomach hurts, you have wet hands.

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,880
So that's a very serious fear.

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
That's right.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,440
And for our last phobia, we have claustrophobia.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
I think it's one of the most common ones.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,200
If you have claustrophobia, you're afraid of smaller tight spaces.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
That's right.

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,440
So people who, so you heard the word claustrophobic, people who are claustrophobic or people who

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,840
suffer from claustrophobia don't like to be in small tight places like elevators, for

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,180
example, tunnels.

72
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,360
So now you brought up an interesting point.

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,120
Our last phobia, we said claustrophobic and now we must make the difference between, for

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,720
example, claustrophobia and being claustrophobic.

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,160
So a phobia, you hear the word, you hear the ending IA, phobia, claustrophobia is a noun.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,280
That means I can talk about, I have it, I have this fear.

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,400
But when you're talking about the adjective, something that describes you, you would have

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,240
to use the ic ending.

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,100
I'm claustrophobic.

80
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,840
He is acrophobic.

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,760
They are aerophobic.

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay, so that is the adjective form.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,200
So if I say I have arachnophobia, it means I have this fear or I can say I am arachnophobic.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Great.

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,000
So this can be used for all other kinds of phobias.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,820
So when you learn those words, remember that there's two different kinds.

87
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,200
There's the IA, there's the IA, a phobia, which is the noun and ic, which is the adjective.

88
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,240
All right.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,160
Let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Are you excited about your trip next month?

91
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes and no.

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't wait to go to Europe, but at the same time, I'm terrified.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why?

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,960
Well, I have aerophobia.

95
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,160
I have a chronic fear of flying.

96
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,840
Oh, really?

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,160
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,240
It's not that bad though.

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,040
I mean, it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,880
miles per hour.

101
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,360
I actually have arachnophobia.

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
You're scared of spiders?

103
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,480
I actually have two more phobias, acrophobia and glossophobia.

104
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,960
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
Are you kidding?

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,560
When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat.

107
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,400
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Wow.

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,560
I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

110
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,460
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

111
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,800
We are such weirdos, right?

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,040
All right.

113
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,240
So we've picked out a couple of different phrases today.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,920
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Fluency Builder.

116
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,520
So in the beginning of today's dialogue, the character said, I cannot wait to go to Europe,

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,240
but at the same time, I'm terrified.

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
So at the same time.

119
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,440
So in this case, we're saying that we are happy, but also we are scared.

120
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,040
So two things at once at the same time.

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Right.

122
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,160
So this is a little bit different from when we talk about, I can do two things at the

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
same time.

124
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,840
I can walk and chew gum.

125
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,360
When we're talking about feelings or emotions, you say, you know, I'm happy, but at the same

126
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
time I'm also scared.

127
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
That means that I have these two feelings and actually they're opposite feelings.

128
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Right.

129
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Exactly.

130
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Usually they are opposite feelings.

131
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,640
So like you say, you're happy, but at the same time you're nervous.

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,920
It's like saying on the other hand.

133
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Exactly.

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
All right.

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,900
Now, when we talked about all these fears, we're afraid of flying, we are afraid of spiders.

136
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,680
We describe them as a chronic fear.

137
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Okay.

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,920
So this adjective chronic is very important because it has to do with time.

139
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Okay.

140
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,800
So I have a chronic fear of heights.

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
That means this is a fear I've always had.

142
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Okay.

143
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
And I will always have.

144
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Right.

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,760
You can also say she has chronic back pain.

146
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,720
That means it comes back again and again.

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
It's not just one time.

148
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,360
It's all, it's some person's whole life.

149
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,640
Maybe not every day, but it comes back.

150
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Right.

151
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Okay.

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,880
So that's, if you say you have a chronic something, you're explaining that you've had it for a

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
while or you will always have it.

154
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,800
Something usually very serious also.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,560
And going back to one of the phobias, we mentioned glossophobia and the other person said, well,

156
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
you know, public speaking is not that bad.

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,080
It's not, it's not something to be so afraid of.

158
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,100
And the other person replied by saying, are you kidding?

159
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,400
Are you kidding?

160
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,400
So this is actually a way of showing some sarcasm when you're talking because public

161
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,960
speaking is not that bad.

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,160
The person wants to say, no, it is that bad.

163
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,400
It is awful.

164
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,280
So are you kidding as a way to say, no, I totally disagree.

165
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Right.

166
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,160
So you're being a little bit sarcastic, but at the same time, you're also acting a bit

167
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
surprised.

168
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,080
Like, I can't believe you said that.

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Like if I said, I really liked the Twilight movies, Marco.

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
Are you kidding?

171
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Those movies are terrible.

172
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
All right.

173
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,560
So Marco does not agree with my opinion.

174
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
All right.

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,200
Now, when we're talking about public speaking, we mentioned that you get on stage.

176
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,560
So this is very important because this is the action to get on stage and speak.

177
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Okay.

178
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,920
So if you have a stage or maybe even you don't have a stage, but you're talking about performing

179
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,240
in front of other people, like a speech or a play, you say you get on stage and it's

180
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
important to remember this as a phrase.

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,560
So whenever I get on stage, I start to sweat.

182
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Now you may want to add the, there you want to say to get on the stage, but it's not necessary.

183
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,800
It's not incorrect, but the usual or let's say more correct form would just be, use the

184
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,240
phrase to get on stage.

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,480
When I get on stage, I get very nervous.

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,760
You don't have to say when I get on the stage.

187
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,440
Or she's normally very shy, but when she gets on stage, she opens up and becomes very, very

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
talkative.

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
That's right.

190
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
All right.

191
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,800
So that's all the phrases we've picked out for you.

192
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be right back.

193
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,360
Are you excited about your trip next month?

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
Yes and no.

195
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't wait to go to Europe, but at the same time, I'm terrified.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why?

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,240
Well, I have aerophobia.

198
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,400
I have a chronic fear of flying.

199
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,120
Oh really?

200
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
It's not that bad though.

202
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,280
I mean, it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700

203
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
miles per hour.

204
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,640
I actually have arachnophobia.

205
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,720
You're scared of spiders?

206
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I actually have two more phobias, acrophobia and glossophobia.

207
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,200
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Are you kidding?

209
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,800
When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat.

210
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,560
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

211
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,800
Well, I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

212
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,720
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
We are such weirdos, right?

214
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,520
All right, so talking about all these phobias.

215
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Now one of these phobias was actually made into a movie, I think in 1990.

216
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,360
Arachnophobia, this very chronic fear of spiders.

217
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
That's right.

218
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,760
I remember when I was younger and this movie came out, everybody started talking about

219
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
how they were arachnophobic.

220
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,440
They had this horrible fear of spiders.

221
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Did you ever see that movie?

222
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Yeah, of course.

223
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
It was terrifying.

224
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,520
Yes, it was supposedly some South American spider that made its way into the United States

225
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,920
in a box, in a crate or something.

226
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,680
Now, many people handle phobias differently.

227
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
Do you have any phobia?

228
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,480
Are you claustrophobic?

229
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,280
Are you arachnophobic?

230
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,440
I don't have any phobias and I'm not really afraid of anything.

231
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,480
So I'm pretty lucky that way, but I know a number of people who are afraid of heights,

232
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,600
acrophobic, and so that's pretty common.

233
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,120
And actually, if you look it up, you will find in the dictionary maybe hundreds of phobias,

234
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,040
people who are afraid of open spaces, people who are afraid of closed spaces, or people

235
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,720
who are afraid of marriage.

236
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,960
They even have a phobia determined for this type of person.

237
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,440
So it's very interesting.

238
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,960
Now, this is going to be a challenge.

239
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,200
Why don't you look up a couple of different phobias and share it with us, maybe some of

240
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,120
the craziest ones or the funniest ones or maybe the strangest ones you can find.

241
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
That's right.

242
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,560
So look them up, share them with us.

243
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,960
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

244
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
All right.

245
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
We'll see you guys there.

246
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:57,400
Have a good one.
