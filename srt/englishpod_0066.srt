00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,360
And today we're going to be bringing you a great lesson about calling the office.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,420
Yeah, that's right.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,080
So in this lesson, we're going to teach you some great words that you can use when you

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
need to call your office to solve a problem.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
Right.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,320
So, you are at home, you have a problem, maybe you can't go to the office, so you have to

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,320
call them and tell them that you're not going to be able to go.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Yes.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,880
So, we're not going to preview anything today because the dialogue is relatively easy.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,800
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
some words.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,720
Hello, hey, Anil Day, Ekings Bay.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,400
Aue, eimea, aealp, hei, ui, ee.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Aue, Anil Day.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,120

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Aue, Uli Jay.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Aue, aealp, hei, ui, ee.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,480
Aue, Uli Jay.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,240
Actually, I'm eating, fei, aeq, hei, ee, lu, te, day.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm already say, ute, ir, hei, ate.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,320
Atwe, zang, rei.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:17,720
I think, te, I'm, am, en, kei, aun, day, it, te, ho, te, lu, fei.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,640
I have, hei, ee, ere, kei.

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
Or, say, ho, te, ani, rei, oz, nei.

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,680
And I'm eating, fei, light, li, sei, ir, sh, fei.

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
I, ee, sei.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,840
O, sei, or, yei, auling, kei, and, ik, sei.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Es, yei.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,800
I, uz, wei, open, hei, ute, ate, of, te, ik, ku, rei, rei.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
O, kei, and, nei.

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,640
I, trei, an, et, gei, aum, sei, es, trei.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
All right, so a pretty easy dialogue, right?

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Yeah, pretty simple.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
All right.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
So there are a couple of words that we want to look at.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
So let's start with language takeaway.

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Language takeaway.

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,440
All right, well, today we're looking at three interesting words.

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
The first one is ouflay.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Ouflay.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Ouflay.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Ouflay.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Marco, what is the ouflay?

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,840
All right, so when you have the ouflay, it means that you are sick.

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,760
You have, it's very similar to a cold.

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Right, but just worse, right?

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Worse, yeah.

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,960
So when you have the ouflay, it'll keep you in bed for a while, for maybe a week or two.

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,520
So you have a fever, your body is hurting.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
You're just, you're really sick.

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Yeah, you're really sick.

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Okay.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
So, ouflay.

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,160
All right, well, what about our next word?

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,320
Well, actually the next word is a phrase that you can use when you're calling the office.

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,600
Alin ke in iksei.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,360
Alin ke in iksei.

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
Alin ke in iksei.

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Okay, this is a really useful phrase and I think it would help us to hear some examples

64
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,160
of what it sounds like so we can understand the meaning.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Example one.

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,480
Or fe iplpe ald ke in iksei ude te.

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Example two.

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:13,960
If uye ald ke in iksei, ant one orme ayn te, or ye ayrd fe.

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Example three.

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Aymat ne iling fe aluwe, ose aym alin ke in iksei.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,320
So with this phrase, you're basically saying that you are not going to the office.

72
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Exactly.

73
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,360
So let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway.

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Ikovore.

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Ikovore.

76
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Ikovore.

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Ikovore.

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,600
Okay, so it's a pretty simple word.

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,040
Ikovore means...

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,240
To get better, to start feeling healthy again.

81
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Okay, so kind of to recharge your batteries.

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Exactly.

83
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,560
So this is a great verb to use when you want to say I'm going to feel better.

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Okay.

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Ikovore.

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,320
So some really great words, some really interesting phrases.

87
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,680
So let's listen to this dialogue again and then we'll come back.

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,280

105
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Well, yeah, a couple of times that I haven't been able to really make it to the office and I've had to call.

106
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,980
So yeah, I would have to call and tell them that I'm not going to make it or maybe that I'm going to be a little bit late.

107
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,980
