00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine and a very Merry Christmas to everyone.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right, Merry Christmas. We are at that time again where we are celebrating Christmas,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we're having dinner with family and friends, we're giving presents and of course,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
there are some other traditions that come into play like for example Santa Claus.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Santa Claus. So, we've got a very special advanced level lesson for you today.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We've got a poem. It's a very traditional poem that is read or listened to on the holiday

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we're going to talk a little bit about some of the interesting words and phrases that are used in this.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But first off, let's just listen to the poem itself.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It was the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and mysterious sounds of bells and bells were heard in the air.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw open the sash.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The snow and snow gave the luster of midday to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but a miniature sleigh, an eight tiny reindeer with a little old driver so lively and quick

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen, on Comet, on Cupid, on Donder and Blitzen,

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall, now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleighs full of toys and St. Nicholas too.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his toe and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He was chubby and plump, a right old jolly elf, and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He spoke not a word but went straight to work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But I heard him exclaim, ere as he drove out of sight,

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night!

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright, we're back. So, the poem is very nice. It's long.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And just to kind of recap what the poem is talking about, what is the general story of the poem?

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The story of the poem is that Santa Claus is coming to visit someone's house.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And there's a person in the story who is watching Santa Claus arrive.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And he's seeing Santa Claus take the reindeer up onto the roof, come down the chimney,

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and lay the presents out for the children, filling the stockings as well.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, so it's basically a nice poetic description of Santa Claus.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And also, it goes in to describe in a very nice way the way Santa Claus looks like.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's very descriptive. We have descriptions of what Santa Claus looks like, what he's wearing, his smile, how he's a little bit fat.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We also have descriptions of the animals, the special animals that we hear about so often that are called reindeer.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Alright, so we've divided up the poem by lines, so then it's going to be easier for you to go to the line that we're talking about.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's start with the first line, with this first word that's actually very interesting.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
"'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house."

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So what does this first word mean?

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
"'Twas' is an abbreviation, so it's a shortened version of, it was.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, so, but do you actually use this now if you're writing?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, this is not something I would use now in writing, and it's not something I would say.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's actually more of an archaic form, something that you might hear in poetry or historical writing.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, so it was the night before Christmas, right? So we're talking about December 24th.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The night of December 24th, that's right.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Alright, so the first two lines talk about how it was the night before Christmas and in the house there was nothing stirring, not even a mouse.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So not even the smallest little animal, so it's very quiet in the house is what's happening.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So now we jump to line number seven, where the poet describes, "'And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap.'"

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So we know that the person talking is the dad, because he's talking about himself and Mama, mother.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They're in bed together.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
"'And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap.'" So I'm wearing a nightcap, a cover on my head, it's like a hat.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
"'And Mama has a kerchief.'"

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's a kerchief?

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A kerchief is another abbreviation, it's short for handkerchief.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And a handkerchief is a piece of fabric or cloth that sometimes we use for our noses when we have to blow our nose.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But also you can use a kerchief in your hair to cover your hair.

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, so if you can imagine it, this must take place, I don't know, maybe 50, 60 years ago

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
when dads used to wear hats to bed and women also handkerchiefs on their heads.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe 200 years ago when people wore these long night hats, nightcaps.

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The pajamas and everything.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right, now let's jump over to line 18 and 19 when he's talking about the reindeer and the sleigh arriving

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and he says, "'I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.'" This is another way of calling Santa Claus, right?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Saint Nicholas is his name, but you also call him Claus or Santa Claus.

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, and then he said, "'More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came.'"

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So the word order is a bit strange here. This is common in poetry.

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We could also say, "'His coursers came more rapidly than eagles.' They were very, very fast."

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But what are these coursers? We're talking about the animals pulling Santa Claus.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And what are those animals again?

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They're called reindeer.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Reindeer. So the reindeer are very, very fast.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, that's right because he's making the comparison about how fast eagles are compared to them.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And we hear their names, right?

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Exactly. He goes on to say, "'Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer.'"

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And all of their names, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder, and Blitzen.

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All eight reindeer. Each animal has its own name.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right. So all eight reindeer. Actually, we're missing one though that's very common nowadays.

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The reindeer that goes in the front lighting, illuminating the sky.

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. You might know the song, "'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'"

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's right. So there are actually nine reindeer nowadays,

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
but I guess this story was before the Rudolph story came out.

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This is interesting because those are the names of all the reindeer.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now, I'm not sure in which order they are. I don't know who's in the back, who's in the front.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know either, but it's important to know that they're very fast,

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and they come down, and then they go up.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They have to take Saint Nicholas to the roof of the house, on top of the house.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's right. So now he arrives to the top of the house, line 32.

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We see, down the chimney, Saint Nicholas came with a bound.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He came quickly, down the chimney, boom.

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And at the end, he's all dressed in fur from his head to his foot.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So top to bottom, he has fur on.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right. And I think he's got fur because he lives in the North Pole, right?

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's right. And it's very cold where Santa Claus lives, so he has to wear these clothes that are very warm.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay. And obviously, since he is going up and down chimneys in line 34, we see,

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and his clothes were tarnished with ashes and soot.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So to tarnish or tarnish means dirty.

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Something is tarnished if it's dirty.

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So his clothes, his fur clothes were dirty with ashes and soot.

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This means that, you know, in your fireplace, when the fire is gone, there's some gray and black stuff.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And that's what's on Santa Claus' clothes.

117
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, very good.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So, and then we go on to line 35, a bundle of toys he had flung on his back.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
All right, a peddler. Now, this is not just something we talk about on Christmas.

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know, we have peddlers all year round.

122
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What are peddlers? What do they do?

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Basically, they go around selling things.

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So maybe you see them in a small market or sometimes in different places and maybe, I don't know, on the streets.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You see them selling little things like toys or combs or books, something like that.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oranges, you see fruit peddlers, people who sell fruit.

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Or you can see those watch peddlers.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, they say, would you like a Rolex watch? That's a watch peddler.

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So that's what they do, right? They're informal salesmen.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They don't have a store. They work on the street.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So this is why Santa looks like a peddler.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He isn't in a store. He has a bag.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And he says, look in my bag.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Right, exactly.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
From line 37, we go on to describe the way Santa Claus looks like.

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So he says, his eyes, how they twinkled.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
His dimples, how merry.

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dimples are those small circles on your cheeks.

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So some people, when they smile, they have these small holes or circles.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Those are dimples. They're very cute.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right. So not everyone has them, right?

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Some people, when they smile, you can see those dimples.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
All right. And his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So we're saying that they're red.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They're red. They're pink.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay. Now in line 39, he says, his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow.

147
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now, droll is a word that some people still use.

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's pretty common in places like England.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We don't use it as much in America.

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We say funny instead.

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But something that is droll, D-R-O-L-L, droll is funny.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So his mouth, his face is funny looking.

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay. His face is funny looking. All right.

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And going on to line 45, we're describing how he was chubby and plump.

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So we're basically saying he was a little bit fat.

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay. A right jolly old elf.

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So what is an elf?

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
An elf is actually normally we talk about elves.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So one elf, two elves as people, little people who help Santa.

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They're mythical creatures who live in the North Pole and who make presents.

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So an elf is a small creature who makes presents.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Or maybe lives in the woods.

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There are many different stories with elves.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right, right. Okay.

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And in line 46, we say, and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What does he mean by in spite of myself?

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is really important and this is something we say in English all the time, in spite of myself.

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I laughed in spite of myself.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So I didn't want to laugh.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I did.

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I wanted to be serious.

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I did laugh.

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So in spite of myself, I didn't want to laugh.

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I laughed anyway.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So you say in spite of myself when you did the thing you did not want to do.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And finishing off, we are going towards the last three lines where we say,

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is a thistle?

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They're talking about the part of a flower that's a thistle.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, okay.

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So they just, they all flew away like quickly, rapidly like the little flower.

185
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, you know when a flower is sending its seeds out, it's down, it's white.

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So maybe if you blow on a flower with the white seeds, they blow away.

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's what it looks like.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It looks like the seeds of a flower being blown away.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Very easy.

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay.

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Line 55 says, but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight.

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So this is an older way of saying, as he drove out of sight.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So as he's flying away, I can't see him anymore.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Almost I can't see him anymore.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He exclaimed something.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So ere means while this is happening.

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Now this is another one of those maybe old English words that we don't use anymore, right?

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You wouldn't really use ere.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Ere I was walking to school, I saw the milkman.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, we don't say this anymore.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But you will find it in poetry and you might also find it in stories.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And line 56, he ends and this is very the famous way that this poem ends by saying,

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, this is the, and the first line of the poem are the most famous.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Everyone knows these.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Very good.

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So a beautiful poem.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why don't we listen to it one more time?

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house,

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and Mama and Papa were in the garden.

219
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The children were playing in the garden,

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and Mama and Papa were in the garden.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads, and Mama in her kerchief,

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and I in my cap, had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

225
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw open the sash.

226
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below.

227
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
When what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh,

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and eight tiny reindeer, with a little old driver, so lively and quick,

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

232
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen,

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
on Comet, on Cupid, on Donder and Blitzen.

234
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly,

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleighs full of toys,

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and St. Nicholas too.

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof,

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
As I drew in my head and was turning around,

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.

244
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his toe,

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow,

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and the smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

254
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He had a broad face and a little round belly

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He was chubby and plump, a right old jolly elf,

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He spoke not a word, but went straight to work

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk,

262
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and laying his finger aside of his nose

263
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.

264
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But I heard him exclaim, ere as he drove out of sight,

267
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!

268
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's very interesting because it's part of the American tradition of Christmas.

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think maybe also in other parts of the world

270
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the poem might be translated or also might be popular.

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But you know, Santa Claus and all these things

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
are traditions that are observed in some countries

273
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and it's very interesting to understand them.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Absolutely, and I'm very curious to know about your Christmas traditions.

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What do you do in your home country on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day?

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Do you know any poems like this or do you listen to this poem in translation?

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let us know. Our website is EnglishPod.com.

278
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Alright guys, we'll see you there and have a Merry Christmas.

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Merry Christmas.

280
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Bye.
