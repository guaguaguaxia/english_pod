00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,540
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson all about cell phones.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,540
That's right.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,640
We're going to be buying a cell phone or also known as a mobile phone.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,700
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at a specific type of phone on

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,360
Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,120
Well, the name of this phone is kind of funny.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,440
It's called a smartphone.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,120
It's very popular these days.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Things like the Apple iPhone or the HTC Hero.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
These are examples of a smartphone.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
That's right.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,680
So basically a smartphone has additional functions more than just a normal mobile phone.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,400
For example, you can check your email on a smartphone.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeah.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,960
So the thing that makes a smartphone different from a normal mobile phone is that it's like

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,520
a small computer.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,320
You can do things like Marco said, send emails or take photos, edit photos, use applications,

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
things like that from your phone.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Okay.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,600
So we're going to be talking about smartphones.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:13,480
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Hello sir.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,720
May I help you?

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Yeah.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
I see.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,440
Well, you've come to the right place.

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,560
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Sounds good.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,120
I don't want it to be too expensive.

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,160
Maybe something mid-range.

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,200
We have this new HTC smartphone.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,080
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,240
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player and touchscreen.

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,940
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

39
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,140
What about Wi-Fi?

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Of course.

41
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,000
You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
One last thing.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is it waterproof?

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All right.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're back.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, have you ever done this?

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Have you ever dropped your phone in the water?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Have you ever damaged the phone like that?

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Luckily, no.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Knock on wood.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I have a good friend who dropped his in the toilet and had to buy a new one.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So this is not made up.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,920
It's actually more common than what people think.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,880
But we'll get to that in a bit.

56
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,240
Why don't we take a look at five key words in Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,600
This first word is very important because in this particular dialogue, we're talking

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,320
about the HTC smartphone.

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,920
This is a special kind of phone and it has an Android operating system or OS.

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,080
So Android is something that Google came up with and they have this operating system that

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,660
they're giving away for free.

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,240
If you want to use it, you can use it.

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
You can make a whole new phone using this operating system.

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,520
So the operating system like Windows or what's the Mac one called?

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Tiger OS.

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Tiger OS.

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
You have these Linux.

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Linux.

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Yeah.

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Linux.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,200
These are like the interface that allows you to use your computer and to interact with

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,640
it and so they're different for different kinds of computers.

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,400
The same is true of a smartphone.

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Exactly.

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
So that's what we're looking at today.

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,160
If you see this word Android, it's a proper noun and as Catherine mentioned, it's the

78
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,260
name of the OS or operating system developed by Google.

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,720
So we're taking a look at a smartphone that uses the Android OS.

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Alright.

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,200
Now this phone not only carried this operating system but also an MP3 player.

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
That's right.

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,720
An MP3 player is a device that plays songs for you.

84
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
So songs can be stored as MP3s.

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,760
A good example of an MP3 player is an iPod.

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
An iPod.

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Exactly.

88
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,040
Or and for many of you, you're listening to this podcast as an MP3 file through an MP3

89
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
player.

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
So that's the name.

91
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,680
We usually say MP3.

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Exactly.

93
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,200
And another feature of this special smartphone is that you can use it on the 3G network.

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
What is a 3G network, Marco?

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Alright.

96
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,320
So a 3G network is a third generation network which allows more information to be sent.

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,160
So not only can you send voice like a normal cell phone network, but now you can send

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,520
pictures or you can download information like for example your email.

99
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,920
So this is a new 3G network.

100
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,800
It allows you to send more information, more data.

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Exactly.

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,720
3G, third generation.

103
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,960
And in addition to this, our customer wants to know about Wi-Fi.

104
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,240
You hear this a lot when you go to a hotel or a restaurant.

105
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
They say we have Wi-Fi access.

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
And Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity.

107
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
So it's basically internet that has no wires.

108
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
You don't need to connect your computer to anything.

109
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,400
You just log on and use the internet.

110
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Alright.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,440
So look out for that when you're in a cafe next time.

112
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,760
Do they have Wi-Fi?

113
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,800
Usually there's a sign on the wall.

114
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,360
And finally, this customer wants to know is this great phone waterproof?

115
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
What is waterproof?

116
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Alright.

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,000
So if you have a watch for example and you can take this watch into a swimming pool or

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,040
the ocean, it means it's waterproof.

119
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
So it resists water.

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,920
It won't get damaged if it gets wet.

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Great.

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,360
So I could say that I have a waterproof jacket.

123
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,600
So that means that when I go in the rain, my clothes don't get wet because they don't

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
go inside the fabric.

125
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Right.

126
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,000
So there are many things waterproof as watches or waterproof cameras.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,520
I've never really seen a waterproof mobile phone though.

128
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,040
That's a good invention maybe.

129
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
That would be.

130
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Alright.

131
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,400
So those are five key words for language takeaway.

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,240
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back.

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Hello sir.

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,520
May I help you?

135
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Yeah.

136
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,600
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

137
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I see.

138
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
Well, you've come to the right place.

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Sounds good.

141
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,040
I don't want it to be too expensive.

142
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,960
Maybe something mid-range.

143
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,000
We have this new HTC smartphone.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,880
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,040
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player and touchscreen.

146
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,740
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

147
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,940
What about Wi-Fi?

148
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,940
Of course.

149
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,840
You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

150
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
One last thing.

151
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Is it waterproof?

152
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Alright.

153
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
We're back.

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,920
So now we have three phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Fluency Builder.

156
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Okay.

157
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,120
This first phrase is a way of expressing something.

158
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,700
So we're going to give you a formula.

159
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
The first word is leading.

160
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,880
So leading mobile phone manufacturers.

161
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,880
So when we use the word leading, we're saying that it's leading an industry.

162
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,200
That means the most important manufacturers in a kind of industry.

163
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Right.

164
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
So it's one of the biggest.

165
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
It's one of the best.

166
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,640
And if we want to change the noun, we can say for example, the leading car manufacturer.

167
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Exactly.

168
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,520
So in Japan, I wonder who the leading car manufacturer is.

169
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Is it Toyota?

170
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Toyota.

171
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,700
And we could also say that about clothing.

172
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,520
The leading clothing manufacturer in America is, I have no idea, cotton maybe?

173
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Cotton, right.

174
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,440
So you can use many other nouns.

175
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,360
And well, if you want to drop the manufacturers, you can say the leading brand in cosmetics

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,560
or the leading supplier of medical equipment.

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,160
So this means the person or the company that's the most important in an industry.

178
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Right.

179
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,240
So going back to one of the features of the mobile phone, we talked about the built in

180
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
camera.

181
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
Now this structure is interesting.

182
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Built in.

183
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,960
Well, we can say that things are built in when they are a part of something else.

184
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,040
For example, a built in camera is a part of a phone.

185
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,400
It's not a camera and a phone, two different devices.

186
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,720
They're put together.

187
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,680
We can also say this about cabinets.

188
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,040
You know, you can buy cabinets and you can put them in your house and keep things in

189
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
them.

190
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
But we often have built ins.

191
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,240
That means that they're stuck on the wall.

192
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,440
You can't take them away.

193
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Right.

194
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,640
So those are called built ins because they're part of the wall.

195
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
So built in camera is a part of the phone.

196
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Right.

197
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,520
So you can pretty much use this structure with two products that are combined as one.

198
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,920
For example, the cabinets that Catherine mentioned, or if your refrigerator has a television incorporated,

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,680
right, you can say this refrigerator comes with a built in television.

200
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,960
Or very common is the laptop with built in speakers.

201
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,600
So that means we don't have to bring speakers with us every time we want to use the laptop.

202
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,080
There's small speakers inside the computer.

203
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Right.

204
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Very good.

205
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
And we have one last phrase.

206
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
One last phrase.

207
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
One last thing.

208
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
One last thing.

209
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
All right.

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
So that's our phrase.

211
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
One last thing.

212
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
Oh, before you go, one last thing.

213
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,160
So this is often said when someone's leaving a conversation.

214
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,120
So I'm going to say, okay, Marco, I've got to go run and do something.

215
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I'll see you later.

216
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Right.

217
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
So one last thing.

218
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Wait, what?

219
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Oh, okay.

220
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
So now I'll wait.

221
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,360
So one last thing is a way to say, no, wait, hold on.

222
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,040
I have to tell you one more thing.

223
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,720
So yeah, as you say, you can use it as a fixed phrase.

224
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,360
One last thing or before I go, one last thing.

225
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Can you take out the dog?

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
One last thing we have to talk about.

227
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Right.

228
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,440
And this was our last word.

229
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:50,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hello, sir.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
May I help you?

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,320
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,520
I see.

235
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,960
Well, you've come to the right place.

236
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,080
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

237
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Sounds good.

238
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
I don't want it to be too expensive.

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
Maybe something mid-range.

240
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,720
We have this new HTC smartphone.

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,600
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

242
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,760
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touch screen.

243
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,440
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the Internet wherever you are.

244
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
What about Wi-Fi?

245
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Of course.

246
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,520
You can access the Internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

247
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
One last thing.

248
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Is it waterproof?

249
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
All right.

250
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
We're back.

251
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:48,560
And I actually read somewhere that many girls have this accident because they place their

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
mobile phones in their back pockets.

253
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,440
So when they go to the bathroom, the phone accidentally drops out and falls into the

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
toilet.

255
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,840
I heard a different explanation for this common problem.

256
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Maybe not very appropriate.

257
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,560
But boys have this problem because they take their phone to the bathroom and they play

258
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
with them when they're using the bathroom.

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,960
I've also heard this that you're maybe checking your messages or checking your email when

260
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
you're in the bathroom and it falls.

261
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Just falls.

262
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Yeah.

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
So I think boys and girls all have this problem.

264
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,560
Be careful with your phones.

265
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,360
Those smartphones are still pretty expensive.

266
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Yes, they are.

267
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
All right.

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,920
