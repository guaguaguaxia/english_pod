00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Katrin and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,600
This one is especially for people who are interested in babies.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
That's right.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,480
Maybe you have a baby, you will have a baby, maybe you're pregnant and this is a great

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,200
lesson for that because we are talking about a baby shower.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,560
Okay, so before we get started, let's take a look at vocabulary preview and learn what

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,000
exactly a baby shower is.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,440
Okay, so a baby shower.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,760
You would think that this is about bathing the baby, about giving the baby a bath.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,680
No, not a real shower.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,520
A baby shower or a bridal shower, these are parties.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,120
Okay, they're parties.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:53,280
And in this case, a baby shower is a party that you throw for a woman that is pregnant,

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
right?

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
That's right.

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,800
So if my sister is going to have a baby, I throw her a baby shower.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,960
It's a party where all of her friends give her gifts.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Okay.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,120
Yeah, it's a way to celebrate having a baby.

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,080
Okay, so they give her gifts, you'll play games as well as to like maybe guess the name

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
of the baby or guess the sex of the baby.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Exactly.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Stuff like that.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,840
Okay, so it's a very common thing.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,440
I think it's mostly for women.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,040
I don't really know if men have baby showers as well.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
I don't think so.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
I don't think so either.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,640
But it's a very popular tradition in the United States and many other parts of the world.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,600
So we're going to talk about that.

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:41,760
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,560
I've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
Let's get started.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, let's start opening some presents.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, look, what a great little bib for the baby.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,760
This will definitely come in handy.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, wow, you also got me a stroller.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,360
That's so great.

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Thank you.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
This next one is from Betty.

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,000
A high chair and a car seat.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
Wow, Betty, thank you so much.

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,080
I really appreciate it.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,200
One more from Carla.

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
A playpen and crib.

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Thanks, Carla.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
This is just what I needed.

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,100
Okay, that's all of them.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,640
No more gifts.

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,440
Now who wants to guess when the baby is due?

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,400
I think my water just broke.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,160
Get me to a hospital.

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,840
All right, so very interesting.

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,960
All the gifts that they got and definitely very useful because this is a very common

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,120
items that you get for babies, right?

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
That's right.

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
This stuff is really, really valuable because if you have a baby or if your brother or sister

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,600
has a baby, you'll notice that these are very common items.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,340
So let's go through a couple of them in today's Language Takeaway.

64
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,720
Language Takeaway.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,300
Okay, so the first word that we're going to take a look at, the most common one and useful

66
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,880
one for a baby is a bib.

67
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Bib.

68
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,840
So, babies are messy.

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
When they eat food, they get their food on their clothes.

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,840
So to protect the clothes, babies wear bibs.

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,840
This is a piece of cloth or fabric around their neck.

72
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Okay, a bib.

73
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,720
And also, sometimes you want to go out with your baby to the mall, you're walking and

74
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,000
you don't want to carry him in your arms all the time.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,080
So you need a stroller.

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,200
Okay, so basically a stroller is a chair on wheels for a baby.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Babies are heavy and as they get older, they get heavier.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,960
And so this is a way to push the baby around, not carry the baby.

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,040
Right, and maybe the baby falls asleep, so they can fall asleep in the stroller.

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Exactly.

81
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,680
Okay, and while talking about chairs, we're going to take a look at two different types

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,060
of chairs.

83
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,960
First one is a high chair.

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,480
Okay, high chair.

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,560
Think about the word high, that means tall in this case.

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,700
A high chair is a chair for babies at the table.

87
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,480
So if you put a baby on a regular chair, they can't eat with adults.

88
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,560
Right, they're too small.

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
So we give them high chairs so that they can sit a little bit higher and they can be at

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,440
the table with adults.

91
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Exactly.

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,060
So they're very common.

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,000
For example, you go to a restaurant, they will have a little high chairs if you have

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,160
a baby or a small child.

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,040
So if you're at a restaurant, you have a baby, you ask for a high chair.

96
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,240
You say, do you have a high chair, please?

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,420
Yeah, perfect.

98
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,200
And well, if you're going to the restaurant or you go anywhere in your car, you need to

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,600
have the baby be safe and obviously they can't fit on a normal seat.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
No, with a seat belt?

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
No, I don't think so.

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,160
So that's why you get them a car seat.

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Okay, a car seat is a special chair that goes on the seat of the car and usually it's very,

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
very safe.

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,840
It's made to protect the baby.

106
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Right.

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
So if you are ever in a car accident, the car seat will help protect the small baby.

108
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Right.

109
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,360
So it's supposed to go in the back of the car, not the front.

110
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Yes, always.

111
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Very good.

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,040
And now moving on to our last two words.

113
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,540
If you're at home, you sometimes want to have the baby play and you get them a play pen.

114
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,720
So basically this is a way for parents to leave the baby playing but not look at the

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
baby the whole time.

116
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Right.

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,020
A play pen is like a cage for a baby, but it's soft and it's cute and it's pretty.

118
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,680
So it's basically like an open area that's protected on the sides and the baby can go

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,200
inside but the baby can't leave.

120
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Right.

121
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,520
It's like a cage basically and it has little toys and that's the way you just keep them

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
in there for a while.

123
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Exactly.

124
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
All right.

125
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,400
And now when you want to put the baby to sleep, it can't obviously sleep in a big bed because

126
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,680
it might roll over, it might fall off.

127
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,440
There's a lot of things that can go wrong, so you get them a crib.

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Right.

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
So a crib is a bed for babies.

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,200
This is usually high off the ground and it's usually quite small and the baby can't climb

131
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
out of it.

132
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Right.

133
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Yeah.

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,840
So it's a very safe bed so the baby can't fall out, can't climb out.

135
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Exactly.

136
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Very good.

137
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,880
So very interesting, very useful things for you if you're having a baby, planning on getting

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,160
these things.

139
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:31,120
So why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

141
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,880
I've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me.

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,440
Let's get started.

143
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,480
Okay.

144
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,360
Let's start opening some presents.

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,320
Oh look, what a great little bib for the baby.

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,080
This will definitely come in handy.

147
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,400
Oh wow, you also got me a stroller.

148
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
That's so great.

149
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,960
Thank you.

150
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,600
This next one is from Betty.

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,320
A high chair and a car seat.

152
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,480
Wow, Betty, thank you so much.

153
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
I really appreciate it.

154
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,520
One more from Carla.

155
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,240
A playpen and crib.

156
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,440
Thanks, Carla.

157
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
This is just what I needed.

158
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay, that's all of them.

159
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,960
No more gifts.

160
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
Now who wants to guess when the baby is due?

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
I think my water just broke.

162
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Get me to a hospital.

163
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,360
Alright, we're back.

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,520
So now let's take a look at two key phrases.

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Easy Builder.

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,240
Okay, so at the beginning of the dialogue, the woman receives a bib for the baby and

167
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,040
she says, this will definitely come in handy.

168
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
To come in handy.

169
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,560
Right, so when something comes in handy, it means it will be useful.

170
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,960
Okay, so something that's handy is useful.

171
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,320
To come in handy means to be useful.

172
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,920
It will be useful in the future.

173
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,020
So for example, you should take a flashlight with you in the car just in case because it

174
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,400
could come in handy.

175
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
That's right.

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Or if I know that Marco is traveling to India, I can give him a map of India.

177
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,040
I say, Marco, this map might come in handy.

178
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Exactly.

179
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Very good.

180
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,680
So to come in handy or in something that is handy, something that's useful.

181
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,560
And towards the end, a very popular phrase you probably heard in every movie that has

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
like maybe a pregnant woman in there.

183
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,560
My water just broke.

184
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
My water broke.

185
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Okay, so the woman says, my water broke.

186
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Take me to the hospital.

187
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Right.

188
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,840
Okay, so this means I'm having my baby right now.

189
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,480
So why do they say that the water broke?

190
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,040
Because actually water kind of breaks, right?

191
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,200
I think there's a protective water cushion.

192
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,880
Basically there's a sack of water protecting the baby.

193
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
It's not just water.

194
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,000
It's all sorts of like body fluids.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,440
And basically when that breaks, it comes out and you know that you're going to have the

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,960
baby because that means the baby has to come out now because that protective fluid is gone.

197
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,360
Maybe the baby just kind of kicks that water out and just like, I'm ready to come out.

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,920
I have no idea how it works.

199
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,840
All right, so very interesting stuff.

200
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time.

201
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

202
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,440
I've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me.

203
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
Let's get started.

204
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, let's start opening some presents.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,880
Oh look, what a great little bib for the baby.

206
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,680
This will definitely come in handy.

207
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,960
Oh wow, you also got me a stroller.

208
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
That's so great.

209
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,520
Thank you.

210
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,160
This next one is from Betty.

211
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,840
A high chair and a car seat.

212
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,040
Wow, Betty, thank you so much.

213
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,960
I really appreciate it.

214
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,080
One more from Carla.

215
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,200
A playpen and crib.

216
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Thanks Carla.

217
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
That's just what I needed.

218
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, that's all of them.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
No more gifts.

220
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,160
Now who wants to guess when the baby is due?

221
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,320
I think my water just broke.

222
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:13,560
Get me to a hospital.

223
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,400
All right, so talking about baby things and baby showers.

224
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,360
It's a very interesting tradition.

225
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,600
I understand that in other countries they don't really celebrate baby showers like this.

226
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Really?

227
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,280
Yeah, or that if they do, they do it in different ways.

228
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,400
I know for example that sometimes in Latin American countries, they usually do it after

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
the baby's born.

230
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,560
Oh, so like a congratulations shower.

231
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Exactly.

232
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,040
And then obviously you know if the baby was a boy or a girl, so then you get them like

233
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
pink things or blue things.

234
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,080
So it's a little bit more.

235
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,720
That's what's really funny about these.

236
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,840
People often want to have the surprise of not knowing if the baby will be a boy or a

237
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
girl.

238
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,880
So when they have the baby shower, they say, oh, I don't know what the gender is.

239
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
And so you end up buying all of these yellow things because yellow is neutral.

240
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,840
It's good for boys and girls.

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,160
I don't know how many yellow gifts I've got.

242
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,360
I think it's a very interesting thing because for example, I know that in China, I think

243
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,640
you can't ask the doctor for the gender of the baby before it's born, right?

244
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,520
I think that's a way to, I'm not sure if it's a rule or not, but it sounds right.

245
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,520
I mean, it's a way to protect female babies.

246
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,720
I think it would be always great to just have it be a surprise.

247
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
You never know.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah, just like, oh, you know, whatever comes out.

249
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,560
Can you imagine not knowing and then you have twins?

250
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,560
That would be great for me, I think, if I had like a boy and a girl, bam, all at once.

251
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
All at once, never have to worry about it again.

252
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,000
Exactly, and then you have the best of both worlds, right?

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're done.

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,520
All right, so very interesting topic.

255
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,840
Let us know if you have baby showers in your country or how do you celebrate a baby's birth

256
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,480
or before it's born?

257
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
What do you do?

258
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Very good question.

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Let us know.

260
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480

We'll talk to you then.
