00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,600
And today we're bringing you another part of our sports series and today we're going

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,760
to be talking about volleyball.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,080
That's right and we're going all the way to New Zealand to visit the Men's Volleyball

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,280
Championships.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,060
So we're going to be looking at some great words and phrases related to volleyball and

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,460
also how to describe a sporting event.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,240
So before we start on the dialogue, let's take a look at two words on vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,120
All right, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
Now the first one, encounter.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,540
Encounter.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,440
An exciting encounter.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,720
All right, so if we have an exciting encounter, it means we have an exciting meeting of two

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,320
people or two teams or two groups.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,140
If I say I had an incredible encounter last night with my best friend.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,740
You met up with your best friend and something happened.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,980
Okay, so that's what an encounter would mean.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Yes.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,420
Looking at our second word now, powerhouse.

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,900
Two powerhouse teams.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,260
All right, so we have two powerhouse teams, China and Brazil.

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,260
That's right.

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,180
So a powerhouse team is basically a strong, powerful, really energetic, great team, right?

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,140
Okay, so we can use it for teams such as in this case, but we can also describe maybe

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,860
a company or a person as a powerhouse.

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,500
That guy is a powerhouse.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,520
He can lift 500 pounds.

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,500
Now I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,180
We're going to be listening to this great sporting event as we are taken to New Zealand

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,180
to see China and Brazil play.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:54,020
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the men's volleyball world championship.

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,540
My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with a plan, Bob Copeland.

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Thank you, Rick.

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,780
We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,620
and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round.

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,940
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,780
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go.

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,020
Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,860
Chun bumps it to the center and a very nice set by Chun.

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,220
Xu spikes it.

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,980
Wow, what a great hit.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,140
The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him, but he managed to

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,180
get the ball in.

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,860
Great play.

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,340
It's China's service now.

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,380
What a superb jump serve by Li.

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,020
Oh, oh, and we have a let serve.

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,020
The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,660
Brazil calls for a timeout and we'll be right back after a short commercial break.

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:58,340
Well, sounds like a pretty exciting encounter between these two countries.

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,220
Very good teams and both of them, as they mentioned, are powerhouse teams.

55
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,460
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that we came across in this

56
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
dialogue.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,860
We're going to be focusing on volleyball words here in Language Takeaway.

58
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,340
Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,380
Okay, so in Language Takeaway today, we're going to have six words and let's start with

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,380
the first one.

61
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,540
Chun bumps it to the center.

62
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,020
All right, to bump.

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
All right.

64
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,620
So, in volleyball, when you are going to receive the ball, you put your arms together and you

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,900
hit it with your forearms.

66
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900
That's right.

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
So at the top of your arm.

68
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
Right.

69
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,540
And that's how you pass it to another player.

70
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,900
That's called a bump.

71
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,540
So it is a noun and a verb.

72
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,220
A bump to bump.

73
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Exactly.

74
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,060
Now, another type of way to move the ball in volleyball we heard in the dialogue is

75
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,060
a set.

76
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,020
A very nice set by Chen.

77
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,940
So a set or to set.

78
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,620
Right, the word can be used as a verb and a noun.

79
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,540
And again, you take the ball and you move it with the tips of your fingers.

80
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,220
That is actually done by the setter.

81
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
Right.

82
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,300
That is done by the setter.

83
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,420
And he does this, he sets the ball, so then the attacker can spike the ball.

84
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,500
That's our next word, to spike.

85
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,660
So to spike the ball.

86
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,200
Or a spike.

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,180
Is when you hit the ball very hard and very fast with the palm of your hand.

88
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,180
That's right.

89
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,700
And that's how you score your points, right?

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Exactly.

91
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,260
So you'll see three basic moves.

92
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,500
The bump, set, and spike.

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,780
But what about the serve?

94
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
All right.

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,180
So our fourth word in volleyball is service.

96
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,260
So it's China's service now.

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,260
Right.

98
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,900
So the service is the opportunity for the team to serve the ball.

99
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Yeah, pretty simple.

100
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Right.

101
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,380
And it's basically to start the game by hitting it to the other side.

102
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,620
Now one type of serve is the jump serve.

103
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
Jump serve.

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Jump serve.

105
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,060
Now this is very popular and you will see some players do this.

106
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,180
They will throw the ball in the air and then jump in the air and hit it.

107
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
That's right.

108
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,180
All right.

109
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
So that's a jump serve.

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,900
And our last word for today is let's serve.

111
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,060
A let serve.

112
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
Okay.

113
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,880
We have a let's serve today.

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,260
So a let's serve is when you serve the ball and it sort of brushes over the net.

115
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Right.

116
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,140
It'll hit the net but it will still pass to the other side.

117
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
That's right.

118
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,620
And that's an illegal move in volleyball, isn't it?

119
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,440
When you are serving, yes.

120
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,460
So a let serve.

121
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,540
Right.

122
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,020
So those are the six terms related to volleyball that we're going to be looking at today.

123
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,540
And well, with this in mind, let's move on to looking at some phrases now in, what is

124
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
it?

125
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Let's go.

126
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
All right.

127
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:57,700
So our two announcers, Bob and Rick, said that we've got an exciting encounter ahead

128
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
of us.

129
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Right.

130
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,020
So they use this phrase ahead of us.

131
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,060
Ahead of us.

132
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,900
So basically, what does that mean?

133
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,460
Something will happen in the very near future.

134
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,020
So they are expecting it or they will encounter it maybe.

135
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Yes.

136
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,780
So why don't we give a few examples of this phrase.

137
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,580
Marco, we've got a long day ahead of us.

138
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,660
We have a very exciting trip ahead of us today.

139
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Okay.

140
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,820
So ahead of us.

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,100
So we know it's an exciting game and we heard the announcers say, without a doubt, both

142
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,020
teams are in top shape.

143
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Okay.

144
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,060
So the phrase without a doubt.

145
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,060
Without a doubt.

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,140
So if I start a phrase using without a doubt.

147
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,540
You're basically saying there's no question.

148
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
It's so obvious.

149
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,900
This definitely is true.

150
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
It's very true.

151
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Okay.

152
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,660
So without a doubt, EnglishPod is the best podcast out there.

153
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,100
Without a doubt, this is the strategy we should take.

154
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Okay.

155
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Very good.

156
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
So without a doubt.

157
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,640
Why don't we move on to our third phrase now.

158
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,020
This will prove to be a competitive match.

159
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,180
So let's look at the phrase will prove to be.

160
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,860
Something will prove to be.

161
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Okay.

162
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,820
So before we get into it, why don't we listen to some examples.

163
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,900
Example one.

164
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,700
I think you'll prove to be the greatest president we've ever had.

165
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,940
Example two.

166
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,900
The new HR policy is proving to be a waste of time.

167
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,660
Example three.

168
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:42,420
We were worried that we were going to get laid off, but our fears proved to be untrue.

169
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,540
Okay so when something will prove to be, it will show itself to be this thing, right?

170
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,940
It will demonstrate.

171
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,980
We will see it.

172
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,040
We will see for sure how it will be.

173
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,780
And now for our fourth phrase, a very simple one, but very common in sports commentators

174
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,040
or when you're watching a game.

175
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,900
You'll say great play.

176
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,480
Great play.

177
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Great play.

178
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Great play.

179
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,620
Now we know play is usually a verb, right?

180
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,260
But here it's acting as a noun.

181
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,720
A play is basically a move in a sport or a game.

182
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,260
So when somebody says a great play, it means all the succession of moves and passes and

183
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,820
hits to make the point.

184
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,780
So it was a great play.

185
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,140
And that you can use that for any sport.

186
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Right.

187
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,080
So why don't we listen to our dialogue now for the second time and then we'll come back

188
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,340
and talk about this very popular sport, volleyball.

189
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:48,380
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball World Championship.

190
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,900
My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland.

191
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Thank you, Rick.

192
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,140
We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil

193
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,980
and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round.

194
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,300
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.

195
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,140
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go.

196
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,380
Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball.

197
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,260
Chun bumps it to the center and a very nice set by Chun.

198
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,420
Xu spikes it.

199
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,340
Wow, what a great hit.

200
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,500
The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him, but he managed to

201
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,540
get the ball in.

202
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,220
Great play.

203
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,700
It's China's service now.

204
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,740
What a superb jump serve by Li.

205
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,380
Oh, oh, and we have a let serve.

206
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,380
The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

207
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Brazil calls for a timeout and we'll be right back after a short commercial break.

208
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,620
So, are you a volleyball fan, Marco?

209
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,780
It's a very nice sport.

210
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,020
It's very fast and it's very hard.

211
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,540
But it's very interesting to get together with friends, maybe at the beach and play

212
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,460
some beach volleyball or something like that.

213
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,740
Yeah, I think that's the best place to play volleyball.

214
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,820
You know, we even have beach volleyball up in freezing cold Canada.

215
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
And do you have sand?

216
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Occasionally.

217
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,380
All right, so volleyball is a great sport, but now we want to know what sport you want

218
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,380
to learn about.

219
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,100
We've covered soccer, we've covered basketball, we've covered volleyball.

220
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,140
So tell us what other sports you would like to learn vocabulary and phrases on.

221
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,620
That's right, you can tell us this and many more things at EnglishPod.com, our website.

222
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,620

223
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,620
