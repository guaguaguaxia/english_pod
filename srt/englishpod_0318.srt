00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,600
My name is Kathryn and today we're talking about something that I think a lot of people

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,880
experience especially with certain things like peanuts and cats.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
So what are we talking about?

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,880
That's right.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,760
Today we are talking about allergies.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,240
So that means that we have a problem with maybe cats.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,200
They make us sick or with certain foods.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,960
Like a lot of people who are allergic to milk actually.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
That's right.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,520
So we're going to talk about a couple of these allergies and symptoms.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:40,120
So why don't we have a listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,640
I feel terrible.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,880
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
What's wrong with me?

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
It looks like you have a cold.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
You should take some medicine.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,800
I don't think it's a cold.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,720
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,280
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,560
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
An allergy?

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,240
I never thought about that.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,600
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen though and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,200
stung so many times.

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,520
Hmm.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,560
Ow!

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,000
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
I guess not.

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Not funny.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,520
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,240
Okay, my bad.

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
How about dust?

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
My office is full of it.

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,880
Yes, the whole office is dusty yet I only feel affected near our desks.

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
You brought your cat into the office?

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,240
Yeah, it's Mr. Snuffle's birthday today.

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,480
Ah, put it away.

43
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,120
I guess we found the problem.

44
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,240
You're allergic to cats.

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,600
Alright so now let's take a look at vocab on Language Takeaway.

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,280
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright so Marco we have a number of things that might happen if you're feeling like you're

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
allergic to something.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
The first one is my eyes are all watery.

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay, so your eyes get watery and that means you start to have a lot of water, a lot of

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,120
tears in your eyes.

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,480
That's right but you're not sad, you're not crying.

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,800
It's just that you have this reaction that you cannot control and the water maybe comes

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
down from your eyes.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Right, usually your eyes get wet and watery, itchy, red, so a lot of that.

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
There's another thing too, this happens a lot.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,160
You feel like you can't stop sneezing.

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
To sneeze.

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,880
A sneeze is something you do when the air comes out of your nose.

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,040
Out of your nose, out of your mouth, out of everywhere.

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,600
Yeah and you can't control it and sometimes it's very, very strong.

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,920
You move your head but it's something that you do when you're allergic to something like

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,720
a cat or a flower but also maybe when you smell something very, some spice like hot

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
pepper.

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, or when you're sick, when you have a cold.

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
That's right.

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,480
And so his friend says that maybe they should put him into quarantine.

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,200
Alright now this is a joke.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,840
If you have allergies you don't have to go to quarantine but quarantine is very serious.

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,040
It's a place where people go when they have a dangerous or very infectious disease and

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
quarantine means that no one else can come in and you cannot go out.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,480
Right, exactly.

73
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,280
So I think when they had the pig flu, the swine flu, many people were put into quarantine

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,200
to make sure they didn't give it to someone else.

75
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
That's right.

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,320
So usually in quarantine you have to wait until you can prove that you're not sick anymore

77
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,840
and then you get to leave.

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
That's right.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,240
Alright, so they were talking about maybe the options of what he's allergic to.

80
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,000
He says I don't think I'm allergic to pollen.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,360
So what is pollen and where does it come from?

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Alright, now pollen is actually a very common allergy and pollen comes from flowers.

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,360
It's kind of like a special dust or special kind of thing that you see on flowers that

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
gets blown away.

85
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,860
So when it's springtime many people suffer from allergies because there's a lot more

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,080
pollen in the air.

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,160
So it's that little dust, usually sometimes yellow, that you can find on flowers and this

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,440
is actually what butterflies and bees look for.

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
That's right.

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Okay.

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,080
And then he talked about, well, he's not allergic to bees and his friend threw a peanut at him

92
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,120
but he said it in a very strange way.

93
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,960
He said, why did you chuck that peanut at me?

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
To chuck.

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Alright, to chuck.

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,040
Now this is a very spoken English way of saying something.

97
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
To chuck means to throw.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
So like, Marco, why did you chuck that pillow at me?

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
That was mean.

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,360
Alright, so to chuck is to throw but usually to throw something strongly.

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,520
So as you said, it's very spoken English.

102
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,120
It's not really proper to actually write it or say it to someone in a formal occasion.

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,080
So you wouldn't say this in your English exam but you could say this with your friends.

105
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Okay.

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,220
So to chuck something.

107
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
So that's all the vocab we have for you.

108
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again.

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Oh, I feel terrible.

110
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

111
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
What's wrong with me?

112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
It looks like you have a cold.

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
You should take some medicine.

115
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I don't think it's a cold.

116
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,400
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

117
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,960
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

118
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,280
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

119
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
An allergy?

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,960
I never thought about that.

121
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,320
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen though and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being

122
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,080
stung so many times.

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,320
Hmm.

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Ow!

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

126
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,720
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,120
I guess not.

128
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Not funny.

129
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,320
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

130
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,960
Okay, my bad.

131
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
How about dust?

132
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,240
This office is full of it.

133
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes, the whole office is dusty yet I only feel affected near our desks.

134
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,560
You brought your cat into the office?

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah, it's Mr. Snuffle's birthday today.

136
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,120
Ah, put it away!

138
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
I guess we found the problem.

139
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,760
You're allergic to cats.

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,960
Alright we're back so now it's time for Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,520
Alright, now we heard a very difficult word later on in the dialogue.

143
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,960
Jim said, not funny, I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Right.

145
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,880
Alright, so this phrase, to go into shock is very important.

146
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,000
Go into shock.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,480
Now what does it mean to go into shock?

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,040
Well shock is something, especially anaphylactic shock, which means that I think you stop breathing

149
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:05,120
because your body basically shuts down and your throat tightens so you can't breathe.

150
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,320
But to go into shock means that your body will kind of stop doing its normal functions.

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,040
For example, if you fall in very, very, very cold water, your body goes into shock.

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,420
And this is something that is a physical reaction.

153
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,960
You see it all the time in movies I think when a nurse or a doctor or someone yells

154
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,080
he's going into shock, right?

155
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,880
That's right and they have to get the paddles and beep.

156
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,180
So that's what it means when you go into shock but you use this verb.

157
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,800
You go into shock.

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,880
He's going into shock.

159
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
That's right, doctor, he's gone into shock.

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
And well he said, okay, I'm sorry, my bad.

161
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
He said my bad.

162
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
What is my bad?

163
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,920
Alright, my bad is another phrase that comes from spoken English so be careful with how

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
you use it.

165
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,680
This is something you can use with your friends.

166
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,520
My bad is a way of saying my fault or excuse me, that was my mistake.

167
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,120
So if you do something wrong and you say, oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake, you can

168
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,160
just say, oh, my bad.

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
That's right.

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,760
Or Jerry, can we go outside for a second?

171
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
I have to talk to you.

172
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
I mean, Marco, oh, my bad.

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Right, exactly.

174
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,400
That means, you know, my fault.

175
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm sorry, I've made a mistake.

176
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,800
But this is very colloquial and I think it's very juvenile, right?

177
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,560
I think younger people use this, my bad.

178
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
My bad.

179
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
Yeah, it's younger, yeah.

180
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
That's a younger, alright.

181
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,160
And for our last phrase, when Jim was talking about maybe being allergic to pollen or he

182
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,800
said I'm desensitized to bee stings.

183
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,720
Alright, so desensitized, you should know automatically that prefix D means not, alright?

184
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
So it's negative.

185
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm desensitized means that I'm not sensitive to, alright?

186
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,440
That means that, you know, if I get stung by a bee, like me, it gets big and red and

187
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
it hurts.

188
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Right.

189
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
But this person, he doesn't have a reaction.

190
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,880
He's desensitized.

191
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
So there's no reaction.

192
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
There's no red.

193
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
There's no swelling.

194
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,000
I think you see it a lot for people that maybe live in an area where there are a lot of mosquitoes.

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,140
And if we go there, we're going to get bitten and it's going to be itchy.

196
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,640
But people who live there, they've been bitten so many times that they probably don't even

197
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,800
feel it or probably don't even get bitten anymore.

198
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
They desensitize.

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
That's right.

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Or you could say that I'm desensitized to loud noises.

201
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay.

202
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,600
I live in a city and there's a metro near my apartment.

203
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I can hear it.

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
It's very loud.

205
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,200
And so I'm desensitized to the noise.

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,040
That means I don't really notice it anymore.

207
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,320
It doesn't bother me.

208
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Right.

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Very good.

210
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,400
So that's all the vocab and phrases we've prepared for you today.

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,160
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

212
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,960
Oh, I feel terrible.

213
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,160
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

214
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,600
What's wrong with me?

215
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Wow.

216
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You're not dying, are you?

217
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
It looks like you have a cold.

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,560
You should take some medicine.

219
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,080
I don't think it's a cold.

220
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,040
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

221
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

223
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,080
An allergy?

224
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,560
I never thought about that.

225
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,920
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being

226
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,440
stung so many times.

227
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,720
Hmm.

228
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,880
Ow!

229
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,680
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

230
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,320
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

231
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
I guess not.

232
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Not funny.

233
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,960
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

234
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Okay, my bad.

235
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
How about dust?

236
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,880
This office is full of it.

237
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,080
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

238
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,160
You brought your cat into the office?

239
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah, it's Mr. Snuffle's birthday today.

240
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,440
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

241
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,800
Put it away!

242
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
I guess we found the problem.

243
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,680
You're allergic to cats.

244
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:12,480
Alright, so speaking about allergies, we always talk about the common ones like pollen, dust,

245
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,200
and you also mentioned about food, like somebody who cannot drink milk.

246
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
They're allergic to milk.

247
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
That's right.

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,560
We have a special name for this, actually.

249
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,160
Someone who cannot drink milk or dairy products like ice cream is called lactose intolerant.

250
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,240
So if you're lactose intolerant, it means that your stomach is very upset after you

251
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,760
have dairy products because lactose is basically dairy.

252
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,000
And there are some people also who are allergic to seafood, for example, fish or shrimp or

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
any type of seafood.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's right.

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,040
And also people who are allergic to gluten.

256
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Now, gluten is a very common product that is found in breads and cereal, things like

257
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
that.

258
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,040
And so people who have an allergy to gluten actually have to change their diet quite a

259
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
bit.

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Yeah, they have to look for things that are gluten-free, which is very hard because apparently

261
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
it's in everything.

262
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
That's right.

263
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,080
So if you have one of these allergies, you can find dairy-free on a box or gluten-free

264
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
on the box.

265
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,640
And specialty food stores will have these labels.

266
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,760
And so are you allergic to anything?

267
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,080
No, not really.

268
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,120
Sometimes here in China, I feel like I'm a little bit allergic.

269
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
I have allergies when the seasons change.

270
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,480
But at home, no.

271
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I have no allergies.

272
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
No allergies.

273
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
No, me neither.

274
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,160
And I'm very lucky, I think, because I can't imagine if I had an allergy like to peanuts

275
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,280
or to seafood, which not only would be a shame because you can't have these foods, but if

276
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,000
you accidentally have it, it could be life-threatening.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's right.

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,960
Like my dad, who is allergic to bees, would go into anaphylactic shock if he were stung.

279
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,080
And so you have to be very careful because you never know when you'll have an accident

280
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
like that.

281
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Exactly.

282
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,360
So this is an interesting topic.

283
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,200
Maybe you guys want to share if you are allergic to anything.

284
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,920
Maybe you are allergic to certain types of foods, chemicals.

285
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,000
Some people are allergic to certain types of shampoo, for example.

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,240
Or fabrics like cotton.

287
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,840
So if you want to share with us, let us know at our website EnglishPod.com.

288
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
We'll see you guys there.

289
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Bye!
