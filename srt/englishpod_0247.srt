00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,760
My name is Catherine and today we're going to continue in our series about job interviews.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,840
That's right.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,280
And on this occasion we're taking a look at part five of our interview series where we

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,080
explain why we left our previous job.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,360
Okay, and so in an interview, this is a very popular question.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,320
Why did you leave your last job?

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Learn some tools for answering this question in today's dialogue.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,720
We're going to take a listen to it first and we'll be back in a moment.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,120
Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Is that right?

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,480
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,040
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,520
I was really just treated more like an intern.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,280
I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,720
So, what changed?

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,440
Well, slowly but surely I proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
to Features Writer.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,600
Wow, a real step up.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,320
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,520
I spent three years in that position.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,560
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
I see.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,720
So why did you decide to leave finally?

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,640
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,320
I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,600
Alright, we're back and as we saw, Rebecca handled it quite well explaining why you left

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,400
your last job because obviously you don't want to say something like, I just really

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,200
didn't like my company or the boss was a really bad guy.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Or I was fired for being lazy.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Exactly.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,120
So, why don't we take a look at a couple of different words on Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Okay, so we've got some great descriptive words here.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,480
These are some adjectives.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,920
The first one is tough.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,000
So Rebecca said, to be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,440
Alright, so she's describing that her first year at that company where she was working,

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,960
it was tough and that means hard, difficult.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
That's right.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,760
You could say, this is a really tough situation.

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,640
That means it's a difficult situation.

45
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,800
It's hard because there's no easy answer.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Exactly.

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,080
So, if you describe something as tough, it means that it's very difficult.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Now there is another meaning to this where it can be that you are a strong person.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Right.

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
So that's different because we're talking about a person, not a situation.

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,240
But if you're talking about a job or an experience or even homework, like this homework is really

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,840
tough, it means that it's very hard.

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Exactly.

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,880
So apart from her job being a little bit tough, she said that it was also a little bit frustrating.

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay, so usually these things go together.

56
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,680
If something is tough, like it's difficult, it's usually frustrating too.

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,560
So in this case, something is frustrating when it makes you unhappy or for example,

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,080
it makes you feel stressed.

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,760
So something that's frustrating is not a good thing.

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Exactly.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,080
So as you gave the example with the homework assignment, if you have maybe a math assignment

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,680
that's very difficult and you can't solve it, you don't find the solution, then you

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
get frustrated.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,600
You get maybe angry at yourself or you get very angry for not being able to solve it.

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,520
So that's when something is frustrating.

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,320
I hate being frustrated.

67
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Exactly.

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,120
Well, it's not a nice feeling.

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,640
But she said that, well, it was frustrating, it was tough, but after a while, I proved

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
myself.

71
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,320
Okay, so that means that she was able to show someone that she can handle difficult things,

72
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,800
difficult work, difficult situations.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,080
And so she said, I proved myself and the new editor liked me.

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,600
So basically, she did a really good job.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Exactly.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,920
So if you prove yourself, you're showing someone that you have great ability or capabilities

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,480
of solving a problem or being able to handle a difficult job.

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
That's right.

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,920
So you could say, last year, Bob didn't do very well at school, but this year, he really

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
proved himself.

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,640
He studied hard and he got really good grades.

82
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Exactly.

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,360
And well, Rebecca, what she got in exchange for proving herself, she got promoted.

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
This is great.

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,960
So promotions are good things.

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,440
The verb here is to promote or to be promoted.

87
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,880
So in this case, she was promoted.

88
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,520
You could say, last year, I was promoted or he will be promoted next week.

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,880
He doesn't know yet.

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Exactly.

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,840
Now, remember that to be promoted means to get a better position in your job.

92
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,320
Now, as we mentioned, the verb is to promote and you may be asking yourself why we are

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
using the verb to be in the past, was promoted.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
And this is because it's an ed adjective.

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,080
It's an adjective that ends in ed.

96
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,480
So you may think it's a verb, but it's not.

97
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
It's actually an adjective.

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,400
The verb here is to be.

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Exactly.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
So I was promoted.

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,280
So was is obviously our verb here, the verb to be, but promoted is an adjective that ends

102
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
in ed.

103
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Okay.

104
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,640
And so if I'm the boss, the action I do, the verb I do is I promote someone.

105
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,120
So this can be a little bit tricky, but we recommend that you check out the website for

106
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
more details because we have lots of examples of how to use this.

107
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Exactly.

108
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,480
Well, she got promoted and well, she was really happy for a while, but then she said, you

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,520
know what, I really needed a more challenging role, a more challenging job.

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Okay.

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Challenging is a great adjective.

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,200
It means something is difficult or it gives you a challenge.

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,960
So that means it's not easy.

114
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Yeah.

115
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,480
So she found that her job was a little bit too easy.

116
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
So she wanted something a little bit more challenging.

117
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Okay.

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
And so this is a really great word for job interviews in particular, because you're basically

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,680
saying, I want hard work.

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,760
I want to prove myself.

121
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
There we go again.

122
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,200
So I want to show you that I'm a good employee or a hard worker.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,040
And so I want a challenge, something that's hard.

124
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Exactly.

125
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,360
So something that is hard is a challenge or you want something challenging.

126
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
So why don't we review these words that we've taken a look at now.

127
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,680
Let's go back to the dialogue and listen to it again.

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,800
Okay.

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

130
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,600
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Is that right?

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,880
Yes, that's right.

133
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,440
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

134
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,920
I was really just treated more like an intern.

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,840
I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
So what changed?

137
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Well slowly but surely I proved myself and the new editor liked me.

138
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,200
So he promoted me to features writer.

139
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Wow.

140
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
A real step up.

141
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Yes.

142
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,080
I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews.

143
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,900
Mostly I spent three years in that position.

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,960
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

145
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,080
I see.

146
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
So why did you decide to leave finally?

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,040
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,440
I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.

149
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,480
All right, we're back.

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:28,240
So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

151
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Fluency Builder.

152
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,600
Okay, this first phrase is unusual because it actually happens at the end of sentences.

153
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,320
This is very, very common with people who are making small talk or who are doing interviews.

154
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,720
This is the phrase, is that right?

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,520
So basically you saw that in the first line Mr. Parsons was talking to her and said, well,

156
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,280
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,420
Is that right?

158
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,940
So he's ending the sentence with this phrase.

159
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,360
So he's making the sentence a question.

160
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,400
I see that you did this.

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Is that right?

162
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,780
So he's asking her to confirm the fact that he knows about her because maybe they've never

163
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
really talked before.

164
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,160
So this is a good way for him to ask her to give more details.

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
So for example, Marco, I hear that you're from Ecuador.

166
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,480
Is that right?

167
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
That's right.

168
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,540
So apart from ending the sentence like this, if maybe somebody asks you, is that right?

169
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
You have to confirm.

170
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,560
You have to say, yes, that's right.

171
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
Or yes.

172
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,600
It's also good to elaborate, to give more details.

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,480
So yes, I'm from Ecuador.

174
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I was born there, but I've lived in the United States.

175
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,640
This is a way to give more information because that's basically what the person's asking.

176
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,560
Yeah, I think it wouldn't be very good if you're at a job interview and the person says,

177
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
is that right?

178
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
And you say, yes, that's right.

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
And then you don't say anything else.

180
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,520
So yeah, basically the point is you have to confirm or deny.

181
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,040
You have to say, yes, that's right or no, that's not right.

182
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,560
And then you have to give some information about the question.

183
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Exactly.

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
All right.

185
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,680
Now, moving on, when Rebecca again was talking about her job, she was saying it's tough and

186
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,200
I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay.

188
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,800
So this is like lost and found.

189
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,080
Like I lost my hat and I found it later.

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,160
No, no.

191
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,920
This is what's interesting about this verb, find.

192
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,640
We are not actually looking for something or we didn't actually find something we were

193
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
looking for.

194
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,440
This is kind of a realization, right?

195
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
That's right.

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
It's like a feeling.

197
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,880
So I find this movie boring.

198
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,120
That means I think this movie is boring.

199
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
It's the way that you're thinking about something.

200
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
That's right.

201
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,320
Or you can say, oh, I found Paris to be quite an expensive city.

202
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, pretty expensive.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,880
So this is your impression.

204
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,320
This is the way that you feel about something.

205
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Exactly.

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
So this is another way that you can use this word to find.

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,720
Now again, when Rebecca talked about proving herself, she used a very interesting, I would

208
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,920
say phrase, a very popular well-known phrase, slowly but surely.

209
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Okay.

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,520
So slowly but surely is the opposite of right away.

211
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Right?

212
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,840
So something that happens right away is immediate.

213
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,280
Like I got promoted right away.

214
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,880
But slowly but surely means after lots of time and even hard work, this good thing happened.

215
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
Or it's usually a good thing, actually.

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Yeah.

217
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,560
You're basically saying that you didn't do anything very quickly, but you did it very

218
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
well.

219
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,720
So slowly but surely, I finished building my home.

220
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Right.

221
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,040
So it didn't happen overnight, but it did happen over time.

222
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,440
You can also say this about studying a language.

223
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,160
At the beginning, learning English was really hard, but slowly but surely, I became fluent.

224
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Exactly.

225
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Okay.

226
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
So slowly but surely.

227
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,240
And the last phrase that we have for you today, you may have seen that Rebecca used this phrase,

228
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,640
to be honest, a couple of times before explaining something.

229
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,560
So why does she say to be honest?

230
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,000
To be honest is sometimes something we say in English to fill some space or some time.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
We call it filler.

232
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,960
But it's also a way to introduce something that's negative.

233
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,320
So for example, in this dialogue, she's talking about her negative experiences.

234
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
My job was tough.

235
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,860
My experience was bad.

236
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,880
So she says, to be honest, it wasn't the best experience, but I learned from it.

237
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,800
She's saying this to introduce some things that are maybe not positive, not happy things.

238
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
That's right.

239
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,520
So it's another way of saying, look, I'm going to tell you the truth.

240
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,880
It may not be something positive, but this is what happened.

241
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,880
So to be honest, I didn't really like my last employer or something like that.

242
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Right.

243
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
We can even talk about this with your friends.

244
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,020
So hey, Marco, did you like that movie Shutter Island?

245
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,320
To be honest, I didn't really see it.

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Oh.

247
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I fell asleep.

248
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,280
Or you could say, to be honest, I didn't love it.

249
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,960
I didn't really like it.

250
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Exactly.

251
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,280
So it's a very good phrase, but don't overuse it.

252
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,920
I think sometimes you get into the habit of using it all the time and just like, like,

253
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,520
you know, well, you know, like I went to the movies like yesterday, like, and like, to

254
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,600
be honest, like, so try to keep these fillers as you described them to a minimum.

255
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
So don't really use them too much.

256
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Yes.

257
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Say thoughts and ideas.

258
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,160
Nice action verbs, not too much fillers, because sometimes, especially in an interview,

259
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,040
it makes people think that you don't really know much to say.

260
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Yeah, exactly.

261
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Okay.

262
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:41,040
So listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to chat a little bit more.

263
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,560
Okay.

264
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,320
Now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

265
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,400
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

266
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Is that right?

267
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
Yes, that's right.

268
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,220
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

269
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,720
I was really just treated more like an intern.

270
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,640
I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

271
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,240
So what changed?

272
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,600
Well slowly but surely I proved myself and the new editor liked me so he promoted me

273
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,840
to Features Writer.

274
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,760
Wow, a real step up.

275
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,480
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

276
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,680
I spent three years in that position.

277
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,720
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

278
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,860
I see.

279
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,880
So why did you decide to leave finally?

280
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

281
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:38,440
I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.

282
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Alright so talking about your last employer, this is a pretty ideal thing.

283
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,940
Now do you have any advice that you can give our listeners about describing your last job?

284
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,400
Why did you leave your previous employer?

285
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,080
Well I do have a little bit of basic job advice.

286
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,640
I would say don't complain about your last employer.

287
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,880
Don't say my boss was mean, my co-workers were lazy, my company was terrible because

288
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,200
usually as a person doing an interview, that makes you think that this person, if they

289
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
work for you, will complain about you.

290
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,640
And so I think it's important like what Rebecca does in this dialogue to keep it positive.

291
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,960
Every negative situation can become a positive experience.

292
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,120
So the job was tough but it was a good challenge, right?

293
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Or but she learned how to do many new things.

294
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,040
I think this is important for anybody in any language but in English especially to use

295
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,440
some of these phrases and to say, you know, I really like a challenge or I didn't feel

296
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,400
this was challenging enough, things like this.

297
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,960
As opposed to, my old boss is so mean, he made me work on the weekends, that company

298
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
is so terrible.

299
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,800
I mean that kind of stuff no one wants to hear.

300
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,440
Yeah exactly and I think it's not really useful because even if the company is the competitor,

301
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,320
so you don't really get any extra points for giving them like the dirty secrets of what

302
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
was going on in the company.

303
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Maybe saying, oh my co-workers, they were just so mean to me and stuff like this.

304
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, no, it makes you seem like a complainer and no one wants to hire a complainer.

305
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Exactly.

306
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,560
Alright so this is an interesting topic we would like to hear from you.

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,320
