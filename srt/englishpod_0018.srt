1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,840
And I'm Erika.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,880
And today with Erika we have a very aggressive lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,720
That's true, we've got a revolutionary lesson.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,760
Yes, today at EnglishPod we're protesting.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,240
So Erika, why don't you tell us what a protest is?

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,040
Well, when you protest something, you go into the streets and show your disagreement.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,960
Right, and you yell and you have signs and everyone's just protesting.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,160
And the news comes and if it's not clear now, it'll be clear after the dialogue, I'm sure.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,600
Definitely, definitely.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,280
So why don't we start with our vocabulary preview?

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,720
Vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,400
We have two words in our vocabulary preview today.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
The first is bankrupt.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Bankrupt.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Bankrupt.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Bankrupt.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,200
So if a company goes bankrupt, what happens?

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,840
It means the company doesn't have any more money.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,280
So it can't pay salaries.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
It can't pay anything.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,820
Can't pay its bills, yeah.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,120
So basically if it's bankrupt, it's probably going to close.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Exactly.

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,320
Okay, our second word today is bailout.

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Bailout.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Bailout.

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Bailout.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,380
B-A-I-L, bailout.

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,200
So bailout is when the government gives money to a company that is about to go bankrupt.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
That's true, it's emergency money that will help save the company.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Well these two words are taken directly from our dialogue.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,680
And in today's dialogue, we're going to bring you live to a newscast.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:50,280
Right, so why don't we just listen to the dialogue?

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,280
This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C. where

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
a protest has broken out.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,920
Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
industry.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,840
Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, 10 on 5 News, can you tell us what's happening?

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,040
Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,160
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,320
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax

43
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
dollars.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,360
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,560
The U.S. government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,440
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,160
I see.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
But many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
hardworking Americans.

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,480
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,000
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
And then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets.

54
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,600
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,280
They're asking for money.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,560
That is just not right.

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
Good point.

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,800
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:14,480
Back to you, Tom.

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,040
Wow, these people are really angry.

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,640
I think they're furious.

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,400
Well, I think they have some good points, and we'll talk about that later.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,360
But now it's time for Language Takeaway.

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Language Takeaway.

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,840
Yeah, there was some great language in this dialogue.

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,640
A lot of language we use to express our anger.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,800
Right.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,440
And one of those words, and the first one for Language Takeaway is injustice.

69
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Injustice.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Injustice.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
An injustice.

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,760
So, an injustice is something that isn't fair.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
It's totally unfair.

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,680
It's unfair, yeah.

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,160
This is an injustice.

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,480
Let's look at our second word, outrage.

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Outrage.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Outrage.

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
An outrage.

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,440
So, Erica, why don't you give us an example on how you would use outrage.

81
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
There's no more coffee.

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
This is an outrage.

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Yeah, there we go.

84
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
That's an outrage.

85
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Okay.

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Let's go to our next word now.

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Breakout.

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Breakout.

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Breakout.

90
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Breakout.

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:26,320
So, we have some great examples on how we use breakout, so let's listen.

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,160
Example one.

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
War is broken out in Antarctica as countries of the world fight for control of the icy

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,760
continent.

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,320
Example two.

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,880
Officials are warning that fighting could break out in the border regions.

97
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,040
Example three.

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
A forest fire broke out last night.

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Well, this is a wonderful phrasal verb that means...

100
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,520
To begin suddenly.

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,080
Okay, so I think that's pretty clear.

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Yeah.

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Yeah.

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Breakout.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Let's go to our next word now.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Mismanaged.

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Mismanaged.

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Mismanaged.

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,480
So, when something is mismanaged, it's...

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,000
Not managed properly.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Managed poorly.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Poorly, right.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
So, our final word today is...

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,840
Have the nerve to.

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,960
Have the nerve to.

117
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,180
Have the nerve to.

118
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,320
I think this one also is a little bit difficult to understand.

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, but we have some great examples prepared for you, so let's listen to them.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Example one.

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,280
I've been in love with you since the third grade, but I didn't have the nerves to tell

122
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,640
you.

123
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,040
Example two.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,480
I don't believe it.

125
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:11,120
You have the nerve to ask me for money when you know I've just lost my job.

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Example three.

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,040
What?

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,080
You have the nerve to bring your new girlfriend to visit my mother.

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,720
So have the nerve to is like dare to do something, right?

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah, how dare you.

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Yeah.

132
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Have the nerve to.

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
It's like, I can't believe you would do that.

134
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,920
Yeah, I think that's quite clear.

135
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Yeah.

136
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Okay.

137
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
A lot of great words in our dialogue today.

138
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,800
And also, we have some really interesting grammar in today's dialogue.

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Right.

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,520
So, today, let's look at some grammar breakdown.

141
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,080
Grammar breakdown.

142
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,160
In this section, grammar breakdown, we show you a particular grammar structure and explain

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,600
a little bit about how that structure affects meaning.

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,600
So, it's not really about getting the grammar perfectly right, it's about understanding

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
the meaning.

146
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Right.

147
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,560
And in today's lesson, we saw some really great examples on how we use the present perfect

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,640
tense.

149
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,200
Let's listen to an example from the dialogue.

150
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,720
Where a protest has broken out.

151
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,040
See the verb here, break out, like a protest has broken out, happened in the past, right?

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Right.

153
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,360
And it's still going on now.

154
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Exactly.

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,560
So, present perfect is used when we're talking about an event that happened in the past and

156
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
is continuing on now.

157
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Exactly.

158
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,840
Or is continuing to affect now.

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Exactly.

160
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,320
Okay, I think that's pretty clear.

161
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,280
Yeah, but now, if you want to indicate or if you want to demonstrate that the action

162
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,120
has finished, the event is over, then you would say it like this.

163
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,480
A protest broke out.

164
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
A protest broke out.

165
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,720
In this form, you see that the protest is over.

166
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
It happened yesterday already.

167
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Right.

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,840
And I think it's really emphasizing the fact that it is no longer affecting the present

169
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
moment.

170
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Exactly.

171
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,880
So, remember, the difference between present perfect and simple past.

172
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,840
Now, if you want to know more about these tenses, present perfect and simple past, be

173
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,720
sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com.

174
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,320
In the grammar section, you can find some more great examples and a really clear explanation

175
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
on how these tenses are formed.

176
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:59,640
But now, we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,640
This is Action 5 news reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C., where

178
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
a protest has broken out.

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing

180
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
industry.

181
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, Channel 5 News.

182
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Can you tell us what's happening?

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,520
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,440
We're here because we feel this is an injustice.

185
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,560
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

186
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,080
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax

187
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
dollars.

188
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,640
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,760
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

190
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,960
The U.S. government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

191
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,840
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

192
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
I see.

193
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,840
But many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of

194
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
hardworking Americans.

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,880
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

196
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,360
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?

197
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
And then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets.

198
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,960
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

199
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,640
They're asking for money.

200
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,960
That is just not right.

201
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Good point.

202
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,320
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

203
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,880
Back to you, Tom.

204
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Okay, Erica, so what do you think about this situation?

205
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,480
About the bailout of the auto industry?

206
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes.

207
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
I think it's a bad idea.

208
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Why?

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
There's so many reasons.

210
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,720
I mean, I don't think it's fair for us as taxpayers.

211
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,840
Well, I guess I'm not really an American taxpayer, but I don't think it's fair for the taxpayers

212
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,640
to have to pay for the mismanagement of these companies.

213
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,280
I mean, they've got so much debt.

214
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,880
They've produced cars that nobody really wants to buy, and now they're in trouble.

215
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,520
And it's not our money that should be spent on saving them.

216
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,760
Yeah, I would agree with you on that.

217
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,840
But you do have to take into consideration the fact that if these companies go bankrupt,

218
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,760
millions of people will lose their jobs, and not only the people that work at the factories,

219
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,120
but also people that work for other companies that supply these factories.

220
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Yeah, I mean, I see what you're saying, Marco, but at the same time, we can't support an

221
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,280
industry that isn't working properly.

222
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,520
I mean, if one of these companies goes bankrupt, it's going to be terrible, but it will force

223
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,780
the other two companies, perhaps, to manage themselves better, to streamline and become

224
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
more efficient.

225
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,920
I just think it will be better in the future.

226
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,880
Well, it could be, but also maybe all three companies can go bankrupt.

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,000
It would be sad because the American car, the American auto industry is a symbol of

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,840
prosperity.

229
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,440
It's also the symbol of the American culture in general.

230
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,280
I guess that's true.

231
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,640
So it would be a shame for it to go bankrupt because everyone owns a car in the United

232
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,180
States, or most people, and it's just something that we can't lose.

233
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,960
But it is an interesting topic and we also want to know your opinions about this.

234
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,760
Yeah, listeners, please come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us what you think

235
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,040
about this bailout and about this lesson.

236
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,300
On the website, we'll post a link to the news article where you can read a little bit more

237
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,680
about this because this is actually going on now.

238
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
That's true.

239
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Well, everyone, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.

240
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Bye.
