00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,640
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,920
Today we've got an intermediate level lesson for you.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,200
If you're interested in buying furniture for your house, you should like this lesson.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
Exactly.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,680
We are going to talk about a ton of different furniture items that you can get to decorate

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
your house to make it all nice.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,320
So we're going to talk about a lot of vocabulary today.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,920
Pay attention while you're listening to some of the pieces of furniture that we talk about

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,760
and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about them.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,240
How about this floor lamp?

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,400
Fine, just get it.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,800
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm so tired.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,880
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Fine.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and loveseat while you look

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
for the rest of the things.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Great.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,520
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a bean bag and a dining set.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,320
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,960
I really want one so I can watch TV.

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,160
Recliner?

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,640
In my beautifully decorated living room?

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I don't think so.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,680
Alright, we're back.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,840
So now what we're going to do is since we have so much vocab, we're going to take a

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,600
look at this language in two parts.

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,800
So now let's go to Language Takeaway Part 1.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Language Takeaway

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,680
Okay, so everyone's heard of a lamp, a light.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,240
This is something that you use to read in the dark, for example, to see in the dark.

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,240
But in this case we have a floor lamp.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,600
So this is a lamp you put on the floor.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,640
Yes, exactly.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
So usually this lamp would be a lot taller.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,280
It'll maybe be like a meter taller, a meter and a half maybe.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,640
Okay, so for example, in your living room next to your sofa, you might have a very tall

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
floor lamp.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,720
This allows you to get more light in the room.

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,480
Right, so sometimes you know the center light in your living room is not enough.

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,840
You want maybe more light in the corners, you get a little floor lamp.

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Okay, so that's the first item.

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,400
Now that we go to the bedroom, we are getting an armoire.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,700
Okay, an armoire.

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,960
This is kind of like a wardrobe.

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,480
It's a piece of furniture we use to keep clothes in, but usually they're hanging clothes.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so a closet is usually inside a wall, right?

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Right, so a closet's a part of your house.

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
It's not furniture.

52
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Right, so an armoire is the same as a closet, but it's not in the house, like in the walls.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
It's outside.

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
It's a piece of furniture.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
It's a big box.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Yeah, I could pick it up and move it.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Okay.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,960
Yes, so an armoire is a tall place to keep clothing.

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,520
Usually you hang your clothes.

60
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,640
You hang your shirts and your dresses and your coats.

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,080
And moving on, we have a dresser.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,600
Now this seems pretty straightforward.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,360
To get dressed, you have a dresser.

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,640
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense, but there is a big difference here between an armoire and

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
a dresser.

66
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,720
A dresser is usually drawers.

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,000
So you keep your sweaters, your shirts, your socks, your underwear in a dresser.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Okay, so an armoire, as you said, usually you hang your shirts or your pants.

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,200
It's for hanging stuff only.

70
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,560
A dresser is you have different drawers where you can put your socks, your boxer shorts,

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
and any other things that you keep.

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Exactly.

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Okay, very good.

74
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,880
So two very handy words, and that's what makes the difference between a closet.

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
So many people say, oh, it's just a closet.

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Well, a closet's different.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,240
No, a closet is actually part of your house.

78
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
It's a part of the wall.

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Maybe it has a door.

80
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,800
Yeah, there's a big difference there.

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Okay.

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,320
So moving on, we have a nightstand that's also usually in the bedroom.

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
That's right.

84
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,520
So I always wondered, why is it called a nightstand and not a daystand?

85
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,720
Well, a nightstand, it makes sense.

86
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,840
It usually has a lamp on it, a light on it.

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,600
And so when you're in bed and you want to read, you have a nightstand next to you to

88
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,120
put your lamp so you can turn the lamp on.

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,600
Usually I also keep my books here.

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,840
So when I'm reading, I put my books down, then I go to sleep.

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,040
Some people also keep their glasses and their alarm clock on a nightstand.

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,560
It's a small table that stands next to your bed.

93
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Very good.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,280
And our last word for language takeaway part one, we have a coffee table.

95
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Okay.

96
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,620
So with the coffee table, Marco, we're moving back into the living room.

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,640
And in the living room, you have a sofa, you have some chairs.

98
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,080
You need a table, but you don't want a big table.

99
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,960
You want a small table or a very short table.

100
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,160
This is a coffee table.

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,760
It's called a coffee table.

102
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm not really sure why.

103
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,760
I guess because if you're having coffee in the living room, this is where you put the

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
coffee.

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
That's right.

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
And we even have something called coffee table books.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,280
These are big, beautiful books, hardback books that have many pictures that you put on your

108
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
coffee table to look nice.

109
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,040
It's not for you to actually read all the time.

110
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,640
Well, I read them, but it's more important to use these books to look nice.

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,280
This is interesting though, because in many other countries, they're not really called

112
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
a coffee table.

113
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,440
A direct translation wouldn't really help you in many cases.

114
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,480
I think in Chinese, it's called a tea table, not a coffee table.

115
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
It makes sense.

116
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Right?

117
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,720
I know in Spanish, it's just called a center table.

118
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Okay.

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,440
So this is basically the low table you have in your living room next to your sofa, in

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,600
front of your sofa actually, so you can have tea or coffee and read books.

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Or put your feet up while you're watching TV.

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Not in my house when I was a kid.

123
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
All right.

124
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be returning a little bit

125
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,480
with more vocab.

126
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,840
How about this floor lamp?

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Fine.

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Just get it.

129
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,480
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

130
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,980
I'm so tired.

131
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,640
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

132
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Fine.

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and loveseat while you look

134
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,800
for the rest of the things.

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Great.

136
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,240
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a beanbag and a dining set.

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,040
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

138
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,640
I really want one so I can watch TV.

139
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,880
Recliner?

140
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,320
In my beautifully decorated living room?

141
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,640
I don't think so.

142
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
All right.

143
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
We're back.

144
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
So now, let's take a look at Language Takeaway Part 2.

145
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Language Takeaway

146
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,400
Coming up, we have one of my favorite phrases in the English language.

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,640
I don't know why I like it so much, but it is a great name for a piece of furniture.

148
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
A loveseat.

149
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Loveseat.

150
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Okay.

151
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Okay.

152
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
It sounds very romantic.

153
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
It does.

154
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
A loveseat.

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Well, think about a sofa.

156
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
A sofa can be very large.

157
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
You can have four or five people on a sofa.

158
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Right.

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
But a loveseat is a small sofa for two people.

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Okay.

161
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,080
So that's what makes the difference, right?

162
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,680
It's a sofa, but only two people can sit on this.

163
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
That's right.

164
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
So a sofa, it's not a loveseat.

165
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,240
And what about if it's one, because usually sofa sets, you have a loveseat, a big one,

166
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,440
and you have one, sometimes an individual one.

167
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,920
Do you just call that a chair?

168
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Yep.

169
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
A chair.

170
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
A chair.

171
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Okay.

172
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Exactly.

173
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
We'll come to it in a minute.

174
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,040
There's a special kind of chair that it might be, but we're not quite there yet.

175
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,600
First, we have another kind of chair, which is very special and reminds me a lot of the

176
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
1970s.

177
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Right.

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,240
We have a bean bag, and this is actually a piece of furniture that's still very popular

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
in many places.

180
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,760
And it's called a bean bag because it's a huge bag that is filled with beans.

181
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Right.

182
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
Beans or something soft.

183
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,680
And when you sit on it, it looks like a ball, but when you sit on it, it can change shape.

184
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Right.

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
It molds to what shape you are.

186
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
And usually they're very light.

187
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,480
A lot of times, I hate to say it, a lot of times bachelors' apartments have these.

188
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
That's right.

189
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,680
It's actually a very cheap piece of furniture, and it's comfortable.

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,400
Sometimes if you're watching TV, you can just sit on your bean bag and watch TV.

191
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,720
Even I know some people may fall asleep on a bean bag as guests.

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,920
I've never slept on, well, maybe once, but I don't remember sleeping on a bean bag.

193
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,440
I imagine it's quite uncomfortable.

194
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
Yeah, for your back.

195
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,960
But moving on after a bean bag, which is a good informal piece of furniture, we have

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,080
a dining set, which is a lot nicer.

197
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,560
Okay, dining set.

198
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
All right.

199
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,520
So a dining set has many pieces.

200
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,000
You have a dining room table.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,340
And you have chairs.

203
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,800
So a set is basically a collection of a table and chairs together.

204
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,400
Sometimes I think it will also include some type of piece of furniture that's next to

205
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,800
the dining table where you can keep your plates and you can keep your teacups and all that.

206
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
What's that called?

207
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
That's called a buffet.

208
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,920
And that's basically, it's like a dresser for your dining room.

209
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Right, exactly.

210
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,520
It's got like drawers and stuff for your plates, your cups, like you said, and it's next to

211
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,200
the dining room table.

212
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,600
But the dining room set or the dining set is for the dining room.

213
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,160
It's the table where you eat dinner.

214
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,880
Okay, very good.

215
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,340
And now moving on to that special chair that I am a big fan of.

216
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,800
It's very comfortable to sit on and it's called a recliner.

217
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,080
So we have a word here, recline.

218
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,200
It means to lie back, to put your head back, to get comfortable.

219
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:38,380
So a recliner is a chair that you can change the shape of to make you lie down flat.

220
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,160
So when you sit down, you're sitting, but what if you want to lie down in a chair?

221
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,840
This chair lets you do that.

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,660
And it also, from the bottom part where your feet are, a little thing pops up so you can

223
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,360
rest your feet on top of this little extension of the chair.

224
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
Okay, so it has a built-in footrest.

225
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,060
Footrest, exactly.

226
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,140
So it's very comfortable.

227
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,420
It's very popular.

228
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,740
If you ever watch the series Friends, they have the recliners.

229
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,760
It's very comfortable to watch sports, for example.

230
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
You have your beer.

231
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Joey has his recliner.

232
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,200
And remember when Joey and Chandler lived together, they have the two recliners in front

233
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
of the TV.

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,480
Those chairs are recliners and they're very, very popular.

235
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,640
Actually I think in the United States, they're very commonly known by the brand, Lazy Boy.

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
That's right.

237
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
There's a brand.

238
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,440
It's not a kind of furniture, but it's the name of the brand.

239
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
It's Lazy Boy and they're very, very famous.

240
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,080
You're right, Marco, for their reclining chairs.

241
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Exactly.

242
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,760
So Lazy Boys, you may hear it, but the real word for it is called a recliner.

243
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,640
So a lot of interesting pieces of furniture there.

244
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
I think our house is going to look amazing.

245
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:52,920
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.

246
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
How about this floor lamp?

247
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Fine.

248
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Just get it.

249
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,960
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.

250
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm so tired.

251
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,040
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser.

252
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Fine.

253
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,120
I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and loveseat while you look

254
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,160
for the rest of the things.

255
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Great.

256
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,680
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a beanbag and a dining set.

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
While you're at it, can you pick up a nice recliner?

258
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
I really want one so I can watch TV.

259
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,320
Recliner?

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
In my beautifully decorated living room?

261
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
I don't think so.

262
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,640
All right, we're back.

263
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,000
So talking about furniture, it's very interesting.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
How do you take it home?

265
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,200
What do you do?

266
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,080
In this case, they were transporting it themselves.

267
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,940
The guy said, I'm going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table, and loveseat.

268
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
So to drop off.

269
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,560
Okay, this is a great verb.

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,800
To drop off.

271
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
It's a verbal phrase.

272
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,680
So the preposition there is off, not on.

273
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,000
So I could say, for example, Marco, I'm just going to drop off my bag at home and then

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,120
I'll meet you guys for dinner.

275
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,960
That means I'm going to go to my house and put down my bag and then I'll leave.

276
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,160
So to drop off is basically to go somewhere so you can put something in that place.

277
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,280
But it doesn't mean that you're going to go to that place and stay there.

278
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,240
So if I say, I'm going to drop off the kids at school, that means I'm going to take the

279
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,640
kids and leave them at school and then go away.

280
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,200
It doesn't mean you're going to school yourself.

281
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,200
So can you drop off the laundry at the dry cleaners, please?

282
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Very good.

283
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,360
So drop off the laundry to the dry cleaners, leave it there and then go somewhere else.

284
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,560
So what happens at three o'clock when the kids are still at school?

285
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
That's right.

286
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,320
Now we use the opposite verbal phrase and that is to pick up.

287
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Okay, drop off, pick up.

288
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,700
So you go pick up the kids.

289
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,560
You go pick up the laundry.

290
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,520
So this isn't just about picking something up from a table or the ground.

291
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,760
You can actually use your car to pick something up.

292
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Right.

293
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,840
You go and retrieve it.

294
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,120
So I'm going to the post office to pick up my package.

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Very good.

296
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,240
So phrases that you're going to have to use if you're talking about furniture, if you're

297
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,400
talking about buying something.

298
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,320
And while we're on the topic, I know that one of the most popular places to buy furniture

299
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
is Ikea.

300
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you a big fan of Ikea?

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I like Ikea and I love what they've done for people who don't want to spend too much money

302
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
on furniture.

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Furniture is expensive.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Furniture is very expensive.

305
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,560
You can spend $5,000 on a sofa.

306
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,360
And so Ikea is a wonderful brand and I think a wonderful company because it makes good-looking

307
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,520
furniture affordable.

308
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,840
And it's because you put it together yourself, right?

309
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
That's right.

310
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,880
A lot of things you have to assemble or put together by yourself.

311
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
So you buy it in a box and then you make it.

312
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,600
It's a little bit frustrating sometimes, but for people like me, and I'm sure people like

313
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,440
you, part of the fun is putting stuff together.

314
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,520
Yeah, because you kind of feel like you kind of built it, but you really didn't.

315
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,200
So it kind of gives you that false sense of accomplishment.

316
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,520
It's like I'm in the 19th century and I can make my own furniture.

317
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,600
So it's very popular.

318
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,920
And apart from having great furniture, I understand that they have amazing meatballs.

319
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
They do.

320
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,720
Well, I'm a Swedish.

321
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
I never get to eat Swedish meatballs.

322
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,360
And here in China, they do have some of the better meatballs around.

323
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,520
So I would recommend if you haven't tried them, try them.

324
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
They're pretty good.

325
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Yeah, go to IKEA.

326
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Go to IKEA, have some dinner.

327
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Let me know.

328
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,600
Do you like IKEA and do you love their meatballs?

330
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
All right.

331
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
We'll see you guys there.

332
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Bye.
