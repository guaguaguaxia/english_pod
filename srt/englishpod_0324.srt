00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine and today we're celebrating a very important and very special American holiday.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right. Today we are celebrating and talking about Thanksgiving, a very, as you say, traditional and big holiday in the United States.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right. So this year it's on November 25th. It's always on a Thursday.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's check out our dialogue to hear about what happens at this special dinner and why this is a holiday and then we'll be back to talk about it in just a moment.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Not much really. It's more of an American tradition. So back home we don't really celebrate it.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You know, it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Once in the New World, they befriended a native named Squanto who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then what happened?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter and in celebration they decided to have a big feast with the natives,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health and new lives.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Interesting. I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Come to my house for Thanksgiving. We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy and lots of stuffing.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Count me in!

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
All right, we're back. So a very interesting holiday.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We learned a little bit about why it's celebrated, how it came to be.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So let's take a look at some of those words now on Language Takeaway.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Language Takeaway

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The first word we have for you guys today on Language Takeaway is settler.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, a settler is a person. What kind of a person is a settler?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Basically, it's a person that goes to a place to settle down there or to settle there and that basically means to live there, to stay there permanently.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right, but the idea with a settler is that he or she will start to build something, build a house, build a city, build a town.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So settlers go to places where there aren't very many people.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right. Kind of hard to be a settler now.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But yeah, back then, obviously, there were so many places that were undiscovered or didn't have people and they would settle there.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And the place where they went in the United States is called Massachusetts.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Massachusetts. Now, this is a very long, very hard to pronounce word and I believe it comes from a local Indian language.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But Massachusetts, if you break it down, Massachusetts is a state.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And you might have heard of the biggest city in Massachusetts, which is Boston.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So Boston, Massachusetts. But this is where the settlers first came when they came to America.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right. So I think if you go to Boston, it has kind of this atmosphere of the settlers and how this old little touch to it of how it used to be.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right. There is an old feel to Boston because unlike most places in America, Boston has been a city for over 400 years, almost 500 years.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So it's much different from places like California or Texas.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right. OK. So the settlers arrived to Massachusetts and they went there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OK. So the key here is persecution. This is something that you do to someone else or this is something a government does to someone else.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Basically, to persecute someone is to is to limit them or to attack them or to to prevent them from doing things that they want to do.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right. So basically, that is the reason why they left England, because the king was persecuting them.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They didn't let them be have their own religion. Right.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They had this religion and the king did not approve of the religion and they felt like people were critical of them or attacking them or preventing them from practicing this religion.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And so their religious persecution in England pushed them to this place, the New World.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that's our next word. Right. That's right. The New World. And this is what they used to call the continent of United States or North America.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They used to call it the New World. All right. So New World, Old World.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So if we think of Europe as being the old world, America, like you're saying, Latin America, North America, these are part of the New World.

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So it's almost like they had never been discovered before. Right. So, yeah, basically everyone was concentrated in Europe at that time.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then when they went to the West, they went to the New World. And obviously, when they arrived, it wasn't empty.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They had people there. And we say that they are the natives of that land.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
OK, so a native of some place is someone who comes from there originally. All right.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So if I came to America in 1500, there were Native American Indians who were living there.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And so they're the natives of this place. Now, can you use that nowadays? Can you say I am a native of Italy?

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm a native of Italy. I'm a native of Chicago. Yes, you can.

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a little bit, you know, it's a little bit less common than saying I'm from Chicago or I'm from Italy, but it's also correct.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OK, but in this case, we're talking about the natives as the people who were already there.

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, Native American Indians. Like Squanto. Like Squanto. That's the name of that Native American Indian who was there.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And this native named Squanto taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So this is the interesting part of the story. It is. Basically, these two groups worked together.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You have Native American Indians and settlers, and they worked together to make a meal and to survive, basically.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And to harvest food, to harvest, the key here is that it's a verb. It's something you do to crops or like corn or potatoes.

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And you take them out from the field and you bring them home.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Right. So in this case, the corn is growing out of the land. And if you go out and cut it down and take it, you are harvesting corn.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are you're picking it, collecting it.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Exactly. And so they harvested the food and they have a very big meal.

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So we do want to talk about the special meal here that features all of this harvested food.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's take a look at some of those words in Language Takeaway Part 2.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right. So talking about the foods. Now, obviously, the tradition is that you have this big meal together.

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And the one thing that is, I think, a given is that you have a big turkey.

70
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's right. So a turkey is a bird. They make very funny sounds, don't they?

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right. Like gobble, gobble, gobble.

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But they they're very big. They run around and they have this red part under their neck and beaks and everything.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So it's a very commonly eaten food for Thanksgiving. But people can eat it anytime.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah. This is a weird thing. I usually don't see turkey too much, if not during Thanksgiving.

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Like I don't see somebody like a restaurant offering turkey.

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, you don't. But you do see it in delis like a roast turkey sandwich.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, this is true.

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because turkey is very healthy.

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
OK. So we have turkey. We also have pumpkin pie. So pumpkin pie.

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Pumpkin pie. This is a classic. You've heard of apple pie.

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But pumpkin pie is a baked dessert that is filled with some pumpkin filling.

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So as you know, pumpkin or may know pumpkin is a big...

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a gourd.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a gourd.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah. I think it's kind of vegetable.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Kind of like a vegetable. It's big and orange. And basically this is a... It's kind of sweet, right? The insides.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It is. It's a little bit sweet. It's big, orange and round, like you say.

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
People often start to harvest them around October. I'd say.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Some people like to eat the seeds. But you can also scoop out with your spoon.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can take out some of the meat, some of the filling.

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that's what we use to create this pumpkin pie.

92
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Very good. So pumpkin pie. Delicious food.

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Now we also have a typical mashed potatoes with gravy.

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
All right. I love mashed potatoes. Mashed means to squish or to break down or to push down.

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And so mashed potatoes, you have a normal potato and you mix up all the potatoes together.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it's kind of like soft and creamy.

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah. It almost becomes like a paste or almost like, let's say, like ice cream, but not cold.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Not cold and not sweet. But yeah, that's the consistency. That's what it feels like.

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so when we eat potatoes like this, in America, we often like to eat it with a sauce.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And the sauce that we eat with mashed potatoes is called gravy.

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Gravy. And now gravy is usually made out of what?

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Gravy is made from... Well, you can make different kinds of gravy.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But the way that we make it at my house is we take all of the juice from the turkey.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because when you bake a turkey in the oven, on the bottom of the pan you'll get some liquid, some water, some fat.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And you use that to make a gravy. So it's brown and it's very salty and delicious.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Awesome. Sounds delicious. And to end things, we have stuffing.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now this stuffing goes inside the turkey, right? But then you take it out.

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's right. So stuffing, we talk about stuffing in general as being something that you put inside something else.

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So if I have a stuffed animal, he has some cotton inside or whatever.

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But if you have a turkey, you take out all of the organs, the heart, the liver.

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You take those parts out because we don't eat those.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And you put some bread, onions and vegetables inside the turkey to cook.

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then you take it out and you eat it. So it tastes a bit like turkey and meat, but it's very delicious.

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But you eat it apart, kind of like let's say rice.

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Like a side dish.

116
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like a side dish.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right. It sounds delicious. And obviously it's a very big meal, but very, very common, a traditional holiday in the United States.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's very fun to celebrate as well. You get together with family and you have this nice meal together.

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right. It's a wonderful holiday. And we'll be talking a bit about it in a second.

120
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But let's just take one more listen to today's dialogue.

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not much, really. It's more of an American tradition. So back home, we don't really celebrate it.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

124
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, you know, it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything.

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

126
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

127
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Once in the New World, they befriended a native named Squanto who taught them how to harvest food from the area, such as corn.

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then what happened?

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter, and in celebration, they decided to have a big feast with the natives,

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health and new lives.

131
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Interesting. I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Come to my house for Thanksgiving. We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy and lots of stuffing.

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Count me in.

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right, so Thanksgiving is a national holiday. Now, is it you said it's a Thursday.

135
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's always on Thursday.

136
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So you get that Thursday off from school, from work and everything.

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You get Thursday and Friday.

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So you get two days.

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, it's a four day weekend.

140
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, nice.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And it's a wonderful holiday because it's something that everybody in America can celebrate.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because, you know, for Christmas, for example, some people don't celebrate Christmas.

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or you don't really get holiday time off during the summer for everyone, maybe just the schoolchildren.

144
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And so this is actually a nice holiday because everybody is home.

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Right. So it doesn't have a religious connotation because you're talking about, you know, the settlers and how they arrived there

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and they survived a harsh winter.

147
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And so, as you say, it's kind of like a neutral holiday where you just it's a good excuse to get together, have a big meal

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and just spend quality time with the family.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's right. You cook all day. You eat. You watch some football on TV.

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You spend some time with your family and you fall asleep very, very full.

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So this is another very interesting thing is that usually on TV, because everyone is home,

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
everyone is having dinner or spending time with each other, they will have a football game on TV for Thanksgiving.

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right. So everyone's sitting around eating dinner and then there's a football game on the TV.

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wow. So that kind of that's kind of bad for the football players that have to be playing on Thanksgiving Day.

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, but they get all hungry, you know, out there on the field and they get to go home and eat a big turkey.

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And have a big meal. It's very, very interesting.

157
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We'll put some pictures of the food that is commonly served on this holiday.

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And it would be interesting to know if I know a lot of our listeners are not originally from the United States.

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So if you are there, tell us if you've celebrated it or how have you seen it or will you celebrate it or any story that you can share with us.

160
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's right. We are very excited to hear this from you and we wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving.

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
