00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,520
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,640
And where are we going today, Erika?

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
To the pharmacy.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,520
All right, to the pharmacy or drugstore?

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,520
Yes.

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,240
Or also in British English, sometimes people say the chemist.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
That's right.

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,120
So as you know, at the pharmacy you get medicine, but there are certain vocabulary words that

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,200
are related to this place that we need to learn.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
That's right.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,840
And then some vocabulary about medicine and also some interesting phrases.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,120
So before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,760
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,320
We're going to look at two words today that you'll hear in the dialogue.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
And the first one, milligrams.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Milligrams.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Milligrams.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,680
Also, the abbreviation for this is MG.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
That's right.

22
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Okay.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
So a milligram is?

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,760
A hundredth of a gram.

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,160
So there are 100 milligrams in a gram.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
Exactly.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,360
And it's very common to be used with medicine, right?

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Exactly.

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
We buy medicine in milligrams.

30
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Okay.

31
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,960
And what's our next word?

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Price check.

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,200
A price check.

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
A price check.

35
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Okay.

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,320
So at the pharmacy or at the supermarket, sometimes the cashier will ask for a price

37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
check.

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,600
And that is the action of checking to find out the price.

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Okay.

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,080
So a price check.

41
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,160
With this, I think we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

42
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,200
And let's see what our shopper is buying at the pharmacy.

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,440
Hello, sir.

44
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,240
How can I help you?

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Yes.

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,720
I need this prescription, please.

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Let's see.

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Okay.

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,920
So 50 milligrams of Prozac.

50
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,440
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

51
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Capsules are fine.

52
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Okay.

53
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,040
You should take one capsule three times a day.

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,760
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

55
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,520
Yes, I know.

56
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,160
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Don't worry.

58
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
I won't overdose.

59
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Okay.

60
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,800
Anything else I can get you?

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
Oh, yes.

62
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I almost forgot.

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,320
Can I also get some eye drops and some condoms?

64
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Sure.

65
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,720
Darn, condoms aren't registered in our system.

66
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, well, that's okay.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll get some later.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thanks.

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Really, it's no problem.

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Just hang on there a sec.

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:35,440
Can I get a price check on Funtime's ribbed condoms, please?

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Oh, no.

73
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
How embarrassing.

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,720
A little bit embarrassing that she asked for a price check on these condoms, right?

75
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Yeah.

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
But you know what?

77
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,440
It seems like every time you have to buy something embarrassing at the pharmacy, there's a million

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
people watching you.

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
It never fails.

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Yeah.

82
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,120
Well, let's take a look at some of those words that we were talking about related to medicine

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
in Language Takeaway.

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Language Takeaway.

85
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
All right.

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Well, the first word, a prescription.

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Prescription.

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Prescription.

89
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
All right.

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,440
So what is a prescription?

91
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,880
Well, a prescription is a note from your doctor explaining what medicine you need.

92
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,840
So this note from your doctor is necessary to buy that medicine, right?

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Exactly.

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay.

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Prescription.

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Well, this shopper was getting some medicine and, well, the chemist or the pharmacist asked

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
if he wanted it in capsules or tablets.

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
So let's look at those two words.

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
A capsule.

100
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Capsule.

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Capsule.

102
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,320
Now, a capsule is like a small tube, right?

103
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Yeah.

104
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,240
It's a form of a pill.

105
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,080
And it's shaped like a tube with the medicine inside.

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Inside.

107
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
Inside, inside inside, in plastic, right?

108
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Exactly.

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,400
Now, you swallow the capsule.

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Yep.

111
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
And the tablet?

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,600
Is like a pill that is round and flat.

113
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Okay.

114
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,240
So tablet and capsule.

115
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,680
Both are the same thing basically, but just different presentations.

116
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Different shapes.

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Different shapes.

118
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Yeah.

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,400
It's easier maybe for some people to swallow a capsule.

120
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You think so?

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I don't know.

122
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
I think so.

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Well, like-

124
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,560
Because sometimes tablets are a little bit like big circles and it's hard to swallow.

125
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Yeah.

126
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,060
And I guess capsules are smoother.

127
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Yeah, exactly.

128
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,640
But we're not pharmacists, so let's move on and focus on the language, which is what

129
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,020
we do know about.

130
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,600
So the pharmacist warned the patient not to take too much medicine, right?

131
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Because he might overdose.

132
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Overdose.

133
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Overdose.

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,340
Okay, so to overdose, like you said...

135
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,440
Is to take too much medicine and get really sick or even die.

136
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,640
So if you overdose on medicine, it could be bad for you instead of good.

137
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,960
Well, obviously very bad.

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
And what about our last word for today?

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,280
Well, the shopper also asked for some eye drops.

140
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Eye drops.

141
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
Eye drops.

142
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,280
So this is medicine for your eyes.

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,440
Yeah, usually liquid, like water that you put in your eyes.

144
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay.

145
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,840
So I think now with this medicine language clear, we can listen to our dialogue again,

146
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,800
but it's going to be slowed down a little bit.

147
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,920
It'll help us understand these phrases just a little bit better.

148
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:23,200
Hello, sir.

149
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,680
How can I help you?

150
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,400
Yes, I need this prescription, please.

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Let's see.

152
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Okay.

153
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,880
So, 50 milligrams of Prozac.

154
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,760
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

155
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Capsules are fine.

156
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,160
Okay.

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,960
You should take one capsule three times a day.

158
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,240
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach.

159
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,720
And also, don't ever mix it with alcohol.

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
Yes, I know.

161
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

162
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
Don't worry.

163
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,160
I won't overdose.

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,280
Okay.

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,040
Anything else I can get you?

166
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, yes.

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,880
I almost forgot.

168
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,000
Can I get some eye drops and some condoms?

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
Sure.

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,600
Darn condoms aren't registered in our system.

171
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,920
Oh, well, that's okay.

172
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,640
I'll get some later.

173
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Thanks.

174
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
Really, it's no problem.

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,280
Just hang on there a sec.

176
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:31,040
Can I get a price check on Funtime's ribbed condoms, please?

177
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay, so now it's time for us to take a look at some of the phrases that we saw in this

178
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,640
dialogue in Putting It Together.

179
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Putting It Together.

180
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,640
We're going to look at two phrases here and we're going to see how we can use them in

181
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,280
different situations.

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,240
The pharmacist warned, be sure not to take it on an empty stomach.

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Okay, so be sure not to.

184
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Be sure not to.

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,280
What does he mean by this?

186
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,920
He just means don't do this.

187
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Okay.

188
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,040
So don't take the medicine without eating.

189
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
We can mix it up a little bit.

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this in different situations.

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,020
Example one.

192
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,320
Be sure not to leave your bike outside or it will be stolen.

193
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,120
Example two.

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,840
Be sure not to forget your umbrella.

195
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,280
It's raining today.

196
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Example three.

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,720
I told him to be sure not to do anything stupid, but he did.

198
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,760
So Marco, why should we say be sure not to instead of don't?

199
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,640
I think don't sounds more like an order.

200
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Okay.

201
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Very direct.

202
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,420
Maybe be sure not to is a little bit softer, a little bit more friendly.

203
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,960
So be sure not to.

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
Now for our last phrase.

205
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,640
So the pharmacist in the end wanted to check for the price and he said, just hang on there

206
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,900
a sec.

207
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,280
So that's interesting.

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Hang on.

209
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Hang on.

210
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Hang on.

211
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Well, hang on.

212
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,480
What does he mean by hang on?

213
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
He means wait.

214
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Wait.

215
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,120
It's an informal way of saying wait.

216
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Exactly.

217
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,760
It's also a little bit more friendly than just saying wait.

218
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Right.

219
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Exactly.

220
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
And we can change the time a little bit, right?

221
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Yeah.

222
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,920
So we can say hang on a second.

223
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
Or hang on a moment.

224
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Hang on a minute.

225
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
All right.

226
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
What about hang on an hour?

227
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Well, maybe if you're telling someone to wait for an hour, just hang on there for an hour.

228
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll be there soon.

229
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Yeah.

230
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,320
But I guess it's more common hang on a minute.

231
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Right.

232
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,680
Maybe for shorter periods of time.

233
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Okay.

234
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,360
So with these phrases, I think now we can use them in different circumstances, obviously

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
not only in the pharmacy.

236
00:08:50,360 --> 00:09:00,760
But let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

237
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Hello sir.

238
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
How can I help you?

239
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Yes.

240
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
I need this prescription, please.

241
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Let's see.

242
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Okay.

243
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,520
So 50 milligrams of Prozac.

244
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,040
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

245
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
Capsules are fine.

246
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Okay.

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640
You should take one capsule three times a day.

248
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,400
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

249
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,120
Yes, I know.

250
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,760
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

251
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Don't worry.

252
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I won't overdose.

253
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,920
Okay.

254
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,400
Anything else I can get you?

255
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,840
Oh, yes.

256
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I almost forgot.

257
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,880
Can I also get some eye drops and some condoms?

258
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Sure.

259
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,280
Darn, condoms aren't registered in our system.

260
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh, well, that's okay.

261
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I'll get some later.

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Thanks.

263
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,800
Really, it's no problem.

264
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,080
Just hang on there a sec.

265
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:56,200
Can I get a price check on Funtimes Ribbed Condoms, please?

266
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,800
Okay.

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,400
So with medicine, an interesting thing comes up, right?

268
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
That's right.

269
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,760
A lot of people think that you eat medicine.

270
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Okay.

271
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Or drink medicine?

272
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Yeah.

273
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
But in English, you always take medicine.

274
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Always take medicine.

275
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Yeah.

276
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,880
So you never can say, oh, I ate my medicine yesterday.

277
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
It always has to be, I took my medicine.

278
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Okay.

279
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
So you take the capsules.

280
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Exactly.

281
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Or take the tablets.

282
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
All right.

283
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
So you take medicine.

284
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,040
Now, an interesting thing in the United States, for example, it's very hard to get medicine

285
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,960
without a prescription.

286
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
That's right.

287
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,680
So we always talk about prescription medicine and OTC medicine or over-the-counter medicine.

288
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
So over-the-counter medicine is?

289
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
Is medicine you can just buy without that prescription or note from your doctor.

290
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Okay.

291
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,760
So for example, if you have a headache, you can go to the pharmacy and buy aspirin.

292
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Yeah.

293
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,640
And that's over-the-counter medicine.

294
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,160
But prescription medicine, you can't get it without the doctor's note.

295
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Yes.

296
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,080
And like you said, in America, you almost have to have a prescription for everything.

297
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,360
Which is strange because people can overdose on aspirin.

298
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,740
So tell us how medicine and pharmacies work in your countries.
