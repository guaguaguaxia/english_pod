00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,720
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,720
My name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
What do you got, Catherine, for us today?

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
That's a good question.

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,880
Well, we've got a little bit of a Seinfeld situation.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,240
So, for those of you who are not familiar with this American TV show, which, by the

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,640
way, is one of my favorites, Seinfeld is a TV show, a comedy, about very awkward, very

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
common situations that are taken to the extreme.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
Right.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,560
So, it's a very popular show.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,040
It was around for like 10 years, I think.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
But it's not airing anymore.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
Well, they're not making new episodes anymore.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,680
No, you have to see them in reruns.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Reruns, right.

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,720
So, we have a situation that's very common and it was pretty funny on the show.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,400
It's a guy trying to rent a car.

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay, so he's probably at the airport or traveling and he's had a long flight and he wants to

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,680
rent a car, but of course, there are some problems.

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,360
So, this is an elementary level lesson, by the way.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,000
So keep that in mind as we listen to this dialogue one time.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,480
Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,680
The name is Jimmy Fox.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,440
I don't understand.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,840
I made a reservation.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,040
Do you have my reservation?

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
Yes, we do.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,720
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,160
But the reservation keeps the car here.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,200
That's why you have the reservation.

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I know why we have reservations.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
I don't think you do.

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,880
If you did, I'd have a car.

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,680
See, you know how to take the reservation.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,700
You just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part

40
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,000
of the reservation, the holding.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Anybody can just take them.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Fine.

44
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll take the compact.

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,240
All right.

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,680
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,160
Would you like insurance?

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,680
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,720
All right, great.

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,520
So this actually happens a lot.

51
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,800
You make a reservation and either they lose it or they run out of cars.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,920
It's such a common situation.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
And it's not just cars.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
Sometimes this happens at restaurants too and it really makes me angry.

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Yeah, that happens a lot.

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,080
You show up and they're like, oh, we don't have a reservation.

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
And you're just like...

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Well, then you have to keep yourself in check.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,840
You can't really get angry.

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
But this guy does.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,100
So let's take a look at the language takeaway to find out what are some of the words we're

62
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:49,200
using here to describe renting a car and what kind of car we're talking about.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
Language takeaway.

64
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,080
Well, as you mentioned, at rental places, they have different size cars, right?

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Different size vehicles.

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
Which, by the way, costs different prices.

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Right.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,040
So let's take a look at the sizes that they mentioned in dialogue.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,160
Starting with the cheapest one, the least expensive and the smallest, it's a compact

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
vehicle.

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
All right, compact.

72
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,440
So compact actually means small.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Small.

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Right.

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
So compact car, you're going to hear very often.

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,680
Even if you're buying a car, let's think of an...

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
What's a compact car?

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
The VW Golf is a compact car, very small car.

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,560
So usually it's two doors or if it's a four door car, it's very small, not very long,

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
right?

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Right, exactly.

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,080
So maybe like a Ford Focus could be a small car, a compact.

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,240
Now moving up in size a little bit, we would have a midsize vehicle.

84
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,440
Okay, midsize vehicle is...

85
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, it's a giveaway here because mid means middle.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,240
So it's kind of in the middle between the small and the large.

87
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,960
And this is your average four door sedan car.

88
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay.

89
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,360
So as an example, you would have a Ford Taurus or maybe a Toyota Camry.

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,920
Yeah, Toyota Camry is maybe the most common car.

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah.

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,800
It's kind of expensive, but it's still midsize, right?

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Exactly.

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,360
And now a bigger car and probably one of the most popular cars in the United States is

95
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,760
an SUV.

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Not anymore, Marco.

97
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I know.

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,040
Yeah, the energy crisis and the...

99
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Gas prices.

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
Well, and the economy as well.

101
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,000
People are not driving their SUVs anymore.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,020
But SUV is an acronym.

103
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,120
That means it stands for three different words.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
S meaning...

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Sports.

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
U meaning...

107
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Utility.

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
V...

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Vehicle.

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
All right.

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Thank you.

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,440
So SUV, sport utility vehicle, means it can go maybe off-road.

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Right.

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,120
So an example of this would be a Ford Explorer or...

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Jeep Cherokee.

116
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,960
A Jeep Cherokee could be an SUV as well.

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
That's right.

118
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,000
Those are three different types of cars.

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Now obviously there are many more like a van or a...

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
A limo.

121
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,920
A limo, like a limousine.

122
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,400
But yeah, these are the most common ones that you would rent at a car rental place.

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,720
Yeah, definitely.

124
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,120
But what we have to do here is make a reservation.

125
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Now interesting, you make a reservation.

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah, you don't have it.

127
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
You don't do it.

128
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,740
You don't...

129
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
You make it.

130
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Yeah, you make...

131
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,080
These are words that go together.

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
So we're going to keep them together.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,480
I can call a restaurant.

134
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
So say for example, Marco works at a restaurant.

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,240
I say, hello, I'd like to make a reservation for tonight.

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Oh, okay.

137
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Perfect.

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,880
Now if you show up at the restaurant, you say...

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Where's my table?

140
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,680
I made a reservation.

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Right.

142
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,680
And of course I throw a fit because there's no table for me.

143
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,280
So you make a reservation and in this case it was made before.

144
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,240
Okay, so you make a reservation.

145
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
Now why was this guy angry at the rental car place?

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Oh, long story short, the company ran out of cars.

147
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,760
Not all cars, just the car that he wanted, the mid-size vehicle.

148
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,560
So they ran out.

149
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,600
So that doesn't mean they're actually running somewhere.

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
No, they're not putting on their running shoes and going for a jog.

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,680
Now in this case, to run out or in this case, we ran out means that they don't have any

152
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
more.

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
You don't have any more.

154
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Exactly.

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,720
So, I think it is a nice word for us to take a look at some other examples now.

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Example one.

157
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,080
We're going to run out of gasoline.

158
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,400
We need to find a gas station soon.

159
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,680
Example two.

160
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Can you buy some milk on your way home?

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,320
We ran out last night.

162
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,640
Example three.

163
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
My pen ran out of ink.

164
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,440
Can you lend me one, please?

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Not a fun phrase, but an important one in case you're ever in a restaurant or in a hotel

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,800
or in a place where you can purchase something or rent something and it's all gone.

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
All right.

168
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,880
So, I think we've taken a look at a lot of great words here.

169
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,120
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

170
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,680
We're going to slow it down just a little bit and then we'll come back and explain some

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
phrases.

172
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,880
Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle.

173
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,680
The name is Jimmy Fox.

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We have no mid-size available at the moment.

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
I don't understand.

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
I made a reservation.

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,920
Do you have my reservation?

179
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,080
Yes, we do.

180
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,720
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

181
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,200
But the reservation keeps the car here.

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,240
That's why you have the reservation.

183
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,200
I know why we have reservations.

184
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
I don't think you do.

185
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,880
If you did, I'd have a car.

186
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,680
See, you know how to take the reservation.

187
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,280
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,760
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

189
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,040
Anybody can just take them.

190
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,000
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,120
Fine.

192
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
I'll take the compact.

193
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,280
All right.

194
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,720
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox.

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,200
Would you like insurance?

196
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

197
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
And we're back.

198
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,720
So, Marco, we've got a couple of phrases here that deserve some attention.

199
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,680
So let's take a look at them in today's Fluency Builder.

200
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Fluency Builder.

201
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,600
So, the first phrase that I want to take a look at is when the agent says, I'm sorry,

202
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,280
we have no mid-size available at the moment.

203
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Okay.

204
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,520
So do they or do they not have any?

205
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Yeah.

206
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
She says, we have no mid-size.

207
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Okay.

208
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,720
So another way to say this is, we haven't got any.

209
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,600
Or we don't have any.

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Okay.

211
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,120
But in this case, you can just simplify it and say, we have no.

212
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,160
Why wouldn't you say we have none?

213
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Good question.

214
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Why?

215
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,680
Because we need a thing here.

216
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,080
We have no cars.

217
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
We have no cake.

218
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,960
We have no food.

219
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,000
So this is a very common phrase in English.

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
And remember to put the thing at the end.

221
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,440
So for example, can I say, I have no money?

222
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Absolutely.

223
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm so sorry, Marco, but I'm not going to lend you any.

224
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I have no money.

225
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,920
Seriously, lend me some money.

226
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,080
So we have no.

227
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,120
This is interesting because this is not a structure that is usually learned through

228
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
textbooks, right?

229
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
You usually say, I don't have or we haven't got.

230
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Exactly.

231
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,480
This is very spoken because you would never say, I go no.

232
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Right.

233
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Exactly.

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Right.

235
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,560
We're not knowing that we, that has an object, something that we have.

236
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,680
So here, I have no is very spoken, very common.

237
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,240
It's got another phrase that is also not taught so much in those textbooks that we were just

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
mentioning.

239
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,560
So what's that phrase at the end?

240
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Well, well.

241
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,440
It's a threat.

242
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
It's a threat.

243
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
The guy is so angry.

244
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,400
He leans over the counter and he points his finger in the agent's face.

245
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,840
And what does he say?

246
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,100
He says, yeah, you better give me the insurance.

247
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
You better.

248
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
You better.

249
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
All right.

250
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,400
So you better than me.

251
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
No, no.

252
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,880
It's not like better, like something is good, right?

253
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,480
You'd better is like a suggestion, but a very strong one.

254
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Okay.

255
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Very strong.

256
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
This is a threat.

257
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Yeah.

258
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,680
You better eat your dinner or I'm going to send you to your room.

259
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Exactly.

260
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,480
So as you can see, it says, he says, you better, you better give me the insurance.

261
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,760
But the grammatically correct way would be.

262
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
You had better.

263
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
You had better.

264
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,360
So the contraction would be you'd better.

265
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Exactly.

266
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,680
You'd, you had better do this.

267
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,320
So this is a, it's a hypothetical situation.

268
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
You had better do this.

269
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,520
If you don't do this, bad things will happen.

270
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,560
So remember that here we've got the grammatically correct form that you should write.

271
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,800
You'd better or the spoken form.

272
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
You better.

273
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
You better.

274
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,640
I think in this one, we should also listen to some other examples to get a better idea

275
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,080
of how we can use this very strong suggestion.

276
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,760
Example one.

277
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,880
You better go to the doctor before that cold gets any worse.

278
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,640
Example two.

279
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
You better watch out.

280
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,960
It's dangerous to go out this late.

281
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,520
Example three.

282
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,920
She better change her attitude or her boss is going to fire her.

283
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,240
So what is the threat?

284
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
You better give me insurance because what is he going to do?

285
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,040
He says, I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

286
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
Okay, so this is future.

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm going to, I'm gonna.

288
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Right.

289
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,280
Beat the hell out of this car.

290
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,160
So this is very strong, right?

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,560
Yeah, it's very strong.

292
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,280
And he's saying he is going to destroy the car.

293
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,640
So beat the hell out of.

294
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,360
That means really just do damage to something.

295
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,240
So you can use it towards a person also.

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,000
It's like, I'm going to beat the hell out of you.

297
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
And I'll arrest you for violence.

298
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Right.

299
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,320
So it's a very strong phrase.

300
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
It shows anger.

301
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,940
It shows that you are threatening somebody.

302
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,480
So it's not, obviously it's not polite.

303
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,560
And it might get you a broken nose in a bar if you ever say this to someone or about someone.

304
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
So be very careful.

305
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Right.

306
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,840
But you can use it to describe a situation, right?

307
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,720
It's like, yeah, we went to a bar yesterday and Dan beat the hell out of the bartender.

308
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Right?

309
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Man.

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,920
So instead of just saying Dan hit the bartender or Dan got into a fight, you're saying he

311
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
hit him and he just.

312
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
And he kept hitting him and kept hitting him and kept hitting him.

313
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
So yeah, he beat the hell out of him.

314
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Right.

315
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
All right, great.

316
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
So those are the phrases and words that we wanted to talk about today.

317
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,520
But I think it'd be good if we listen to this dialogue one more time just to get a good

318
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
feel for it.

319
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,520
When we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about the process of renting a car.

320
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,440
Hi, I made a reservation for a midsize vehicle.

321
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
The name is Jimmy Fox.

322
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry, we have no midsize available at the moment.

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
I don't understand.

324
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,840
I made a reservation.

325
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,040
Do you have my reservation?

326
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,080
Yes, we do.

327
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,680
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

328
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,160
But the reservation keeps the car here.

329
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,200
That's why you have the reservation.

330
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
I know why we have reservations.

331
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,020
I don't think you do.

332
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,880
If you did, I'd have a car.

333
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,660
See, you know how to take the reservation.

334
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,240
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

335
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,880
And that's really the most important part of the reservation.

336
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
The holding.

337
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,000
Anybody can just take them.

338
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,960
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

339
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,920
Fine, I'll take the compact.

340
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
All right.

341
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,680
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox.

342
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,200
Would you like insurance?

343
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:02,600
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

344
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,960
You know, I heard that in Florida or in certain like cities of California and Florida, you

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,280
can actually rent luxury cars.

346
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Oh, yeah, you can do that in most places.

347
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,640
You can rent like a Porsche or a Lamborghini or a Ferrari.

348
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,800
Yeah, obviously it costs a lot of money, but it gives you the opportunity to maybe drive

349
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
one of these cars that you obviously wouldn't have the money to buy.

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,120
Yeah, especially if you're talking about those warm places like Florida, California, you

351
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,240
want to be in the sunshine, you get a convertible.

352
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
You got to get a convertible.

353
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,800
Yeah, so I think the insurance premiums on those particular cars are very high though.

354
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,680
So you're not only paying for the car, but you're also paying for the insurance and possibly

355
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
the speeding tickets.
