00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,800
My name is Kathryn and it's the holiday season.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,560
Today we have a lesson all about a special December holiday.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
That's right.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,960
We are getting close to Christmas and of course today we are going to talk about Christmas

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,800
in the United States and some of the typical traditions that you see over there.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
That's right.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,760
So we're going to be looking at a family as they wait for Christmas morning to arrive.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,160
If you don't know what that is, don't worry, you'll hear us talk about it in a moment.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,880
But first let's listen to our dialogue.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,440
What are you doing awake?

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,940
I can't sleep.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,940
But it's almost midnight.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,940
Exactly.

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,940
I'm too excited for Christmas morning.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,120
Also, I thought I heard Santa.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Really?

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
How do you know it was Santa?

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,280
Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings so I thought I'd

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
be nice and make Santa cookies.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,560
I even left out some milk.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,600
I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies so I came downstairs.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Hmm.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,440
Well, I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree spying

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
on him.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Really?

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Really.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,520
Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
That way we can let Santa do his job.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,360
Then when you wake up, it will be Christmas already.

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Okay.

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,240
Hey, honey, is that you?

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,360
Don't eat all the cookies.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,400
I want some too.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Alright, we're back.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,960
So now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,840
Okay, I just said it but here's that phrase again.

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,160
Christmas morning.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
That's right.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,760
So Christmas morning is December 25th in the morning, right?

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
That's right.

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Okay.

45
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,120
Okay, so the tradition is that small children will wake up early and run downstairs and

46
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,280
they will find Christmas presents under the Christmas tree.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,120
And so this is the Christmas morning tradition.

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,080
Many countries, they celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve, the 24th, right?

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,400
Alright, so Christmas Eve is December 24th, Christmas Day or if it's in the morning, Christmas

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,240
morning is December 25th.

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,920
And as you said, kids come downstairs or go to where the Christmas tree is to look for

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,880
their presents that Santa came and left for them.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
That's right.

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,720
So the idea, the story is that Santa comes at night, late at night and brings presents

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,000
for the children.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,840
And when the children wake up, they see the presents but Santa has already gone.

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,440
So Santa is a man, he's kind of a mythical figure with a big white beard and a red outfit

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,920
and a red hat.

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Right.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,120
So his name is Santa Claus or just Santa.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,920
There are many, many different names for Santa in different cultures and different countries.

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,200
Yeah, some people like to call him Saint Nick or Saint Nicholas but most people will call

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,960
him Santa in America.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
That's right.

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,080
So this is what happens or part of what happens during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,400
And usually also, boys and girls will find our stockings that will be filled with candy

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
or small toys as well.

68
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
That's right.

69
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,240
Stockings are basically socks.

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,800
But these are special socks that you don't wear, you hang them and a lot of people like

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,880
to put them on the fireplace.

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
They hang them from the fireplace.

73
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,400
And like you said, Marco, they're filled with sweets.

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,520
The story says that boys and girls who are nice get good things like sweets and toys

75
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,720
and boys and girls who are naughty get coal.

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Coal.

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,960
So that's that black material that we use to make a barbecue for example.

78
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Yeah, exactly.

79
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,640
It's very dirty and it's not something you want in your stocking.

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Okay.

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
That's right.

82
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
So that's what we get in our stockings.

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,840
And now when the small boy and his father were talking, they were saying that he should

84
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,640
go back to bed and not hide behind the tree.

85
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,160
So if they're in the living room or they're downstairs in the house, what tree do they

86
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
have?

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,640
We're not talking about a big real tree outside.

88
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,560
We're talking about the Christmas tree.

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,200
But you know, it's a long phrase, the Christmas tree.

90
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
We don't have to say it that way.

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,200
When we have a Christmas tree inside the house, we can just call it the tree.

92
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Okay.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,160
And the Christmas tree, as many of you may have seen already, is a pine tree usually

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,720
and you put decorations on it and the presents go under it.

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
That's right.

96
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,040
So you might hear this phrase, there are presents under the tree or there are many nice presents

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
under the tree.

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,640
That means there are lots of nice presents under the Christmas tree.

99
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
That's right.

100
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,120
And well, the kid wanted to stay behind the tree and spy on Santa Claus.

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
That's right.

102
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,800
So this is a verb, to spy.

103
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,280
This means to watch someone but to watch them while they don't know that you're watching

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
them.

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
So you're hiding but looking at someone else.

106
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Right.

107
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
You're spying.

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,320
This is where the noun comes, a spy like James Bond.

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
James Bond spies.

110
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
He is a very famous spy.

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
That's right.

112
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,280
But in this case, the boy does not want Santa Claus to see him so he is spying on Santa

113
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Claus.

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
All right.

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Very good stuff.

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:30,360
Let's listen to the dialogue again and review this vocab.

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,920
What are you doing awake?

118
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,420
I can't sleep.

119
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
But it's almost midnight.

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Exactly.

121
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm too excited for Christmas morning.

122
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,720
Also, I thought I heard Santa.

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Really?

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
How do you know it was Santa?

125
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings.

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,080
So I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies.

127
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
I even left out some milk.

128
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,400
I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies so I came downstairs.

129
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Hmm.

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,920
Well, I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree spying

131
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
on him.

132
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Really?

133
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Really.

134
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,880
That way we can let Santa do his job.

136
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,200
Then when you wake up, it will be Christmas already.

137
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,720
Hey, honey, is that you?

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't eat all the cookies.

139
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,320
I want some too.

140
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,040
All right, we're back.

141
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,960
So now let's take a look at three phrases on Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Fluency Builder.

143
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
All right.

144
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,840
So, Marco, there's another great phrase in here that we often use just around Christmas.

145
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,880
What is it that Santa Claus does?

146
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,560
Well, the way Santa Claus leaves presents for boys and girls is that he will come down

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
the chimney.

148
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,760
We saw that when the dad said, well, Santa Claus won't come down the chimney if you're

149
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
here hiding behind the tree.

150
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
All right.

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,080
So the chimney is part of the fireplace.

152
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,840
A fireplace is where you have a fire in your house to keep warm.

153
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,080
And the chimney is where the smoke goes to come outside.

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
But Santa Claus goes the other way.

155
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,760
He comes down the chimney from the roof into your house.

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
That's right.

157
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,120
And then he leaves the presents.

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,840
So the father said, all right, so, you know, stop spying on Santa.

159
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All right.

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Get back to bed.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,320
And this is a phrase that you're going to hear parents say a lot to their children.

163
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,480
So if the children are awake or walking around, you say, get back to bed.

164
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,100
That means go back to sleep.

165
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,160
Go back to sleep.

166
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
That's right.

167
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,520
And we want the kid to go back to sleep so we can let Santa do his job.

168
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
All right.

169
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,600
Like that last phrase, this is a phrase that you can use in other ways.

170
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
It's not just for Christmas.

171
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,920
But we said, you know, let Santa do his job.

172
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,840
Let Santa leave his presents.

173
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,800
Let's not bother Santa.

174
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,200
But we can change Santa with any other name.

175
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Right.

176
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,560
So you can say, I don't know, maybe your dad is working in the office and your mom will

177
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,840
tell you, you know, come out here.

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,080
Let dad do his job.

179
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
That means don't bother dad.

180
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,200
Don't distract him.

181
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Let him work.

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Right.

183
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
OK.

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,120
So that's the way that you use those phrases.

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Very good stuff here.

186
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Why don't we review one last time?

187
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,360
What are you doing awake?

188
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,860
I can't sleep.

189
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
But it's almost midnight.

190
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Exactly.

191
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,860
I'm too excited for Christmas morning.

192
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,120
Also, I thought I heard Santa.

193
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Exactly.

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
How do you know it was Santa?

195
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,640
Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings.

196
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,480
So I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies.

197
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,440
I even left out some milk.

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,020
I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies.

199
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,600
So I came downstairs.

200
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Hmm.

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,320
Well, I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree spying

202
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
on him.

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Really?

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Really.

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed.

206
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,600
That way we can let Santa do his job.

207
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Then when you wake up, it will be Christmas already.

208
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,480
OK.

209
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,160
Hey, honey, is that you?

210
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't eat all the cookies.

211
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,560
I want some, too.

212
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
All right.

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,700
So these Christmas traditions are, as we said, they're typically American, but many other

214
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,200
cultures share similar traditions like this.

215
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
That's correct.

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,680
Obviously, traditions are different in every family.

217
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,820
Not everyone celebrates Christmas morning.

218
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,240
Some people celebrate Christmas Eve.

219
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,880
But most people will be familiar with Christmas stockings, Christmas trees, and Santa who

220
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,520
comes down the chimney.

221
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
That's right.

222
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,080
So it also depends, I guess, on the culture and religion.

223
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,120
Some religions celebrate Christmas differently or not at all.

224
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,840
So it's actually a very interesting time of the year.

225
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,600
But if you look or if you can see any American movies, like I remember this one called The

226
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:13,780
Santa Claus, you can see the typical American Christmas, snow and trees and presents and

227
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,800
Santa Claus, a lot of things.

228
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
That's right.

229
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,720
So a good way to end this would be to say have a very Merry Christmas.

230
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,160
That means have a nice holiday.

231
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
Enjoy Christmas.

232
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,000
If you're not going to celebrate Christmas for whatever reason, you can just say happy

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,060
holidays.

234
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Happy holidays.

235
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
That's right.

236
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,960
And of course, you can go to our website, EnglishPod.com, where we want to know if you
