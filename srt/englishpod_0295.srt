00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco. My name is Katherine and

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,080
here today we have almost, almost to the end of our series on giving a presentation in

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,600
English. This is part 9 of 10, so this is near the end. But we've got a lot of really

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,280
great words and phrases for discussing what you've talked about in the last, I don't know,

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,960
10 minutes or so. It's the summary of your speech and so that's what we're going to talk

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,960
about today.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,240
That's right. So let's take a look at what Mr. Ford is saying in his summary and we'll

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,760
be back in a bit.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,000
Right everyone. I apologize that I can't show you the marketing campaign today, but next

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,100
week you will all have the opportunity to see it for yourselves. And I have no doubt

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,680
that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,100
As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha Computers. The recession

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,000
is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,620
especially in the developing markets. If we are to succeed in this ultra-competitive field

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,580
then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,140
on all levels. As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,960
can really satisfy those needs.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,500
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,820
range and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the X420

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,420
in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,220
and impressive products.

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,580
Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I really see no limit in

23
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,220
our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier. Quality, excellence, and

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,220
service.

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,780
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,140
really sums up everything that we've discussed today and hopefully it will provide you with

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,540
the same inspiration that it gives me. As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means

28
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,900
doing it right when no one is looking. Well, in fact our customers are looking. They are

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,580
looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,220
We cannot let them down.

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:23,140
All right, we're back. So now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

32
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Language Takeaway.

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,620
So, Marco, at the very beginning of today's monologue, we have a phrase that basically

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,700
means the same thing as summarize. What was that phrase?

35
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,260
That's right. At the last sentence of the first paragraph, we see Mr. Ford say, let

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,540
me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points. So the phrase there is wrap

37
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
up.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:50,300
It means to conclude, to finish, to end. This is the very end of his speech and so to wrap

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,220
something up means to finish it.

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,460
That's right. So maybe if you're giving a speech and someone is telling you to wrap

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
it up quickly.

42
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
That means stop.

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,460
That's right.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,060
Please find an ending point. So wrap it up. Let's go. Come on.

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,820
That's right. So he's wrapping it up by summarizing what he has talked about. And so he goes back

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,380
to the very beginning and he says, as I mentioned at the outset.

47
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,820
Okay, the outset is a noun, it's a time and it means the beginning. So you might remember

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,500
in parts one or two of this speech that he was talking about why 2010 is an important

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,580
year for their company. And so this is the outset. This is the beginning. You can also

50
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,060
say at the outset things looked bad but it turns out that they went well.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,780
Okay. So outset means beginning the start of something. Okay. And he also talked about

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,660
how the computer industry demand is booming.

53
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,580
All right. So booming is an interesting word because boom, the noun means boom, a sound.

54
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
To explode.

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,780
Right. It's a sound that you hear when there's a storm. But booming means doing very well.

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,780
That means that in this case demand is booming. There is a lot of demand.

57
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,620
That's right. So when you hear people say business is booming.

58
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,220
That means business is going very well. It's very successful.

59
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,580
Okay. So it basically means that it's doing very well, that it's growing quickly and rapidly.

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:22,620
So he went on to talk about the X420 and how the company has plans to keep expanding and

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,380
keep coming out with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

62
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,900
Okay. So something is a revolutionary if it changes a situation. Okay. Because revolution

63
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,340
basically means change but not a small change, a really big change. And so a product is revolutionary

64
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,700
if it introduces something really new, really exciting.

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay. So an example of a revolutionary product was the home computer.

66
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,820
Exactly. Because the home computer changed the way people typed and communicated and

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,780
did all these different things. And so it's revolutionary because it introduced a big

68
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,780
change.

69
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,300
That's right. Okay. So revolutionary. Towards the end of Mr. Ford's dialogue, he said that

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,500
they're going to have a Q&A section and he left us with a quote that according to him

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,420
sums up everything we've discussed today.

72
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,900
Okay. To sum up. This is very related to the word to summarize. It means to say in fewer

73
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,900
words. Okay. So this quote says what he wants to say, but it says it in a very short space.

74
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,460
So if we read a book and I ask you to sum up the story, this is basically I'm asking

75
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,740
for a summary.

76
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,220
That's right. So I could say, you know, the Harry Potter story is a story about a young

77
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,220
boy who is a wizard who loses his parents, who goes to school with his friends and learns

78
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
about his powers.

79
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,020
That's a perfect way to sum up the Harry Potter story. All right. Very good.

80
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,340
So that's about it for language takeaway today, but we have some great phrases coming up for

81
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,220
you in Fluency Builder. Let's listen to the dialogue again first and we'll be back in

82
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,420
a moment.

83
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,660
Right everyone, I apologize that I can't show you the marketing campaign today, but next

84
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,760
week you will all have the opportunity to see it for yourselves. And I have no doubt

85
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,340
that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,780
As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha Computers. The recession

87
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,700
is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming,

88
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,340
especially in the developing markets. If we're to succeed in this ultra competitive field,

89
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,260
then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs

90
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,060
on all levels.

91
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,820
As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy

92
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,140
those needs. I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the

93
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,860
new X420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the

94
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,060
X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary

95
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,100
and impressive products. Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I

96
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,540
really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier,

97
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,900
quality, excellence, and service.

98
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,460
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that

99
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,820
really sums up everything that we've discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with

100
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,220
the same inspiration that it gives me. As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means

101
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,580
doing it right when no one is looking. Well, in fact, our customers are looking. They're

102
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,460
looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

103
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,460
We cannot let them down.

104
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:48,260
All right, we're back. So now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

105
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,900
Fluency Builder.

106
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,020
So the first phrase we've got here in Fluency Builder is an interesting one, and I think

107
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,540
it's important to point out because we've got a verb and a noun that often go together.

108
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:07,180
Mr. Ford said this kind of computer can really satisfy those needs that customers have.

109
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,340
That's right. So the phrase there is to satisfy a need. And as you said, this verb and this

110
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,340
noun usually go together. You want to satisfy your customers' needs.

111
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,420
All right, so what do I need? I need a good computer that is fast that I can do my business

112
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:30,500
on. And this computer, the X420, satisfies that need. It does what I need it to do.

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,620
Okay, so we understand the verb to satisfy, but the phrase is a very powerful phrase,

114
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,340
especially if you use it in business where you're saying we are giving our customers

115
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,420
what they need and we are making them happy.

116
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Exactly.

117
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,260
Okay. As he continued talking about the X420, he said this is just the beginning.

118
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,020
All right, so this is something we often say when we have a long project or plan. You can

119
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,500
say, yes, things are good now, but this is just the beginning. All right, there are many

120
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,660
good things to come. And this is something we often say in a positive way. Yes, this

121
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,460
is good, but expect better things in the future.

122
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,180
Very good. Okay, so this is just the beginning. And well, as he continued talking about the

123
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,060
company, he said that the customers are looking for us to lead the way.

124
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,540
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase because he's making a comparison with other companies

125
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,980
and he's saying, listen, our customers have many needs, but they want us to really be

126
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:41,060
ahead of them and to innovate and to make new things and new computers that will be

127
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,180
ahead of the competition. So take the lead, be in the front.

128
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,740
So basically the phrase to lead the way is for you to be in the front and give people

129
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,020
a clear path.

130
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,460
Think of Usain Bolt, that runner in the Olympics. Everyone's running quickly, but all of a sudden

131
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,660
he takes the lead. He leads the way. He is ahead of everyone else. All the other runners

132
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,340
are far, far behind him.

133
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,300
That's right. Okay, so he's leading the way and he finishes his monologue by saying, we

134
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,540
cannot let them down. We cannot let our customers down, basically. So the phrase here is to

135
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,340
let someone down.

136
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,300
He let me down. We let them down. This is a great phrase and you can use it about anybody.

137
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,100
And it's a really important phrase because it means to disappoint someone. So for example,

138
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,260
Marco, when you forgot my birthday, you really let me down.

139
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:38,060
Okay, so that means I disappointed you because I forgot your birthday. So to let someone

140
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:45,060
down is to disappoint them, to not do what you were expected to do.

141
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,100
Exactly. And so a company can do this. For example, when a company like Toyota makes

142
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,740
a car that has many problems, that company lets down its customers.

143
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,900
So you can let someone down. Basically, you have to have the subject. You let someone

144
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,900
down or the company let down its customers.

145
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Exactly.

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,100
Okay. A lot of great stuff here. Why don't we take one last listen and we'll be back

147
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,300
in a bit.

148
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,540
Right everyone, I apologize that I can't show you the marketing campaign today, but next

149
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,620
week you will all have the opportunity to see it for yourselves. And I have no doubt

150
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,180
that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

151
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,620
As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha Computers. The recession

152
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,540
is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming,

153
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,140
especially in the developing markets. If we are to succeed in this ultra-competitive field,

154
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,100
then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs

155
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,660
on all levels. As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that

156
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,460
can really satisfy those needs.

157
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,020
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420

158
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,300
range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the X420

159
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,940
in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary

160
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,980
and impressive products.

161
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,100
Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I really see no limit in

162
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,740
our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and

163
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
service.

164
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,300
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that

165
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,660
really sums up everything we've discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with

166
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,060
the same inspiration that it gives me. As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means

167
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,660
doing it right, when no one is looking. Well, in fact, our customers are looking. They are

168
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,300
looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

169
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,980
We cannot let them down.

170
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,340
Alright guys, so this is the penultimate lesson about presentation skills. As you saw, we

171
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,660
are summarizing and concluding the presentation, and there are actually a lot of great things

172
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,940
here to learn from, especially the vocab where you're saying, okay, let's sum things up,

173
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,460
to wrap it up, to conclude, to summarize.

174
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,580
Summarize the key points, yeah. But there are also some important things coming up next

175
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,500
week. That's the very, very last part of this series, because usually after a presentation,

176
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
there is a section for questions and answers. That's called Q&A, and that's the topic of

177
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,820
our next show. So you guys should stay tuned for that.

178
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,420
Alright, so we'll see you guys next time, and of course, if you have any questions or

179
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,740
comments, you will always find us at EnglishPod.com.

180
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
See you guys there.

181
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Bye.

182
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:55,560
Lauren, we have a lot of questions.
