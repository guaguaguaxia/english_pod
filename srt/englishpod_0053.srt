00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,720
And today, we're back bringing you another great lesson, an intermediate lesson.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,920
That's right, about one of my favorite subjects.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,480
We're talking about food.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Exactly.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,480
So, on this occasion, we're going to be talking about food.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,280
So let's preview some words on Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
All right.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,320
We have three words for you today.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,400
And the first word is head chef.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Head chef.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Head chef.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,240
So, what is a head chef?

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,600
Well, in a professional kitchen, this is the boss of the kitchen or the leader of the kitchen.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Okay.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,800
So the head chef is the main cook.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,280
Yes, but he doesn't cook.

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
But he doesn't cook.

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Okay.

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
All right.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,800
So if he doesn't cook, who's the one that does the cooking?

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,920
That brings us to our second word, sous chef.

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Sous chef.

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Sous chef.

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Sous chef.

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
S-O-U-S.

31
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,280
So the S is silent because it's like a French word.

32
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,520
Yeah, something like that.

33
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Okay.

34
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,480
So the sous chef is the second in line to the head chef.

35
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,680
Yeah, he's the number two.

36
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Number two.

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,920
So he's basically the one that's doing some of the work in the kitchen.

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Yeah.

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,600
Now let's take a look at our last word, cuisine.

40
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Cuisine.

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Cuisine.

42
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Cuisine.

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
So this is an interesting word.

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,960
What exactly does it mean?

45
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,760
Well, it basically means cooking, right?

46
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Okay.

47
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,400
It's the art of cooking.

48
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,520
So for example, I can say French food.

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Yeah.

50
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Or French cuisine.

51
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,400
French cuisine, which includes all the food.

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Yeah.

53
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,800
And this is also the major that people study in college to become a chef.

54
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Yeah.

55
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
You study cuisine.

56
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
And cuisine is a noun, right?

57
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
It's a noun.

58
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Okay.

59
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,280
So I think we're ready to dive into our dialogue.

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,680
What exactly is going on?

61
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,700
Well, we're in a restaurant and it's a really busy night.

62
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,560
And so we're going to listen to what is happening in the kitchen.

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,240
Right away, sir.

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Your order will be ready shortly.

65
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,160
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for table seven.

66
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm working as fast as I can.

67
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
We are really in the weeds.

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,800
Where is my sous chef?

69
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,480
Luc, I need you to peel more potatoes.

70
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Jean-Pierre, another special.

72
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
We're really packed tonight.

73
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
We're running low on wine.

74
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
Is there any left in the cellar?

75
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,120
Wow, we're really doing well tonight.

77
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Harry, stop talking and get over here.

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,240
I need some sautÃ©ed and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

79
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay, I'm on it.

80
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,880
Jean-Pierre, table seven has requested to see the chef.

81
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,360
I think there are food critics from Cuisine Magazine.

82
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay, so a busy night here at this restaurant.

83
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I know.

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,240
It sounds like there's a lot of pressure on this chef, Jean-Pierre.

85
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,880
Yeah, you can tell in his voice that he's really stressed out.

86
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Okay, let's take a look at some of this kitchen vocabulary that we found in Language Takeaway.

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Language Takeaway.

88
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,400
All right, well, we've got five words for you today.

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,320
And the first one is peel.

90
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Peel.

91
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Peel.

92
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Peel.

93
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
P-E-E-L.

94
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,920
So, this is a verb and it means to...

95
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,440
Remove the outside skin.

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
Okay, so for example, when you're going to eat a banana...

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,920
You must peel it first.

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
You must peel it.

99
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,360
You got to take away the yellow skin.

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
What else do you peel?

101
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Oranges, potatoes...

102
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Potatoes, like in the dialogue.

103
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
What else can you peel?

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
I don't know.

105
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Carrots.

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Carrots.

107
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Some people peel their tomatoes.

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I don't know why.

109
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Yeah, it is kind of weird.

110
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
All right, now let's take a look at our next word.

111
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Chop.

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Chop.

113
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Chop.

114
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Chop.

115
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,440
So, again, another verb and it means to...

116
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,960
It means to cut food into pieces.

117
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,760
So, if you're going to eat carrots, first you got to chop them.

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Exactly.

119
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,240
Right, you can't put a whole carrot in...

120
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
In your soup.

121
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
In your soup or in your rice.

122
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Yeah.

123
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Okay, chop.

124
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,520
Okay, our next word, stirred.

125
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,080
Yeah, this is the past participle of the word stir.

126
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, so the verb stir.

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Stir.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,600
So, when you stir something...

129
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Imagine you have a big pot and you've got a long spoon.

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
You move the spoon around in circles.

131
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,200
So, you're stirring the pot.

132
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
You're mixing.

133
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,520
To stir is very similar to mix.

134
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Yes.

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Okay.

136
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
So, you just move the food around.

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Move the food around.

138
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Yeah.

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Okay, our next word, butchered.

140
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,920
Again, the past participle of the verb butcher.

141
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Okay, butcher.

142
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Butcher.

143
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,760
Now, this verb to butcher something, it's when you remove all the bones and all the

144
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
organs from the meat.

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Exactly.

146
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
So, you cut up the meat.

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
And this is interesting because it's also a noun.

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Right.

149
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
A butcher is a person who cuts up meat.

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,120
Okay, so it's really easy.

151
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,160
A butcher butchers meat.

152
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes.

153
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,800
All right, our last word, buttered.

154
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Buttered.

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Buttered.

156
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Buttered.

157
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,160
Okay, so buttered, this is weird.

158
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I know.

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Normally, we all know the noun butter, but here it's acting as a verb.

160
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Okay.

161
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,440
So, when you butter something, you spread or put butter on it.

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Okay.

163
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,600
So, to put butter on something.

164
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,880
So, you can butter a piece of bread.

165
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Exactly.

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
Or in this case, the fish is being buttered.

167
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,960
Sounds delicious.

168
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,720
Okay, now we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

169
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:53,160
We're going to slow it down a little bit so it's easier to understand.

170
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
Right away, sir.

171
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,920
Your order will be ready shortly.

172
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,720
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for table seven.

173
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,640
I'm working as fast as I can.

174
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,280
We are really in the weeds.

175
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Where is my sous-chef?

176
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Luc?

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,400
I need you to peel more potatoes.

178
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,280
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
It's not possible.

180
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
I'm fed up.

181
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,840
Jean-Pierre, another special.

182
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,680
We're really packed tonight.

183
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,280
We're running low on wine.

184
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Is there any left in the cellar?

185
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,840
Whoa, sorry I'm late, everyone.

186
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Wow, we are really doing well tonight.

187
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,320
Harry, stop talking and come over here.

188
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,920
I need this sauce stirred and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

189
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,160
Okay, I'm on it.

190
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,680
Jean-Pierre, table seven has requested to see the chef.

191
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,000
I think they are food critics from Cuisine Magazine.

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,560
Okay, so that seems to be a little bit better.

193
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,500
And hey, I noticed that there's a lot of really great kitchen words in here, like words that

194
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,880
you commonly hear in a professional kitchen.

195
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,280
Okay, so let's take a look at these kitchen words in Fluency Builder.

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Fluency Builder.

197
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,240
All right, we've got three phrases.

198
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,880
And the first one is in the weeds.

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,920
In the weeds.

200
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,400
In the weeds.

201
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
In the weeds.

202
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,160
So when you're in the weeds, you're so, so busy and you can't do all the work you need

203
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
to do on time.

204
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
Okay, so in the weeds, it means that you're really busy.

205
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Yes.

206
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,400
And you can't finish everything.

207
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,360
And you have too much to do.

208
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Yep.

209
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
In the weeds.

210
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,480
Okay, our next word, running low on.

211
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,960
Running low on.

212
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
Running low on.

213
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Running low on.

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,320
Okay, so before we get into explaining what running low on means, let's listen to some

215
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,920
examples.

216
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Example one.

217
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
You better look for a gas station.

218
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,540
We're running low on fuel.

219
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,240
Example two.

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
We're running low on beers.

221
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,480
Can you go out and get some?

222
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Example three.

223
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,480
My flashlight is running low on battery.

224
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,160
Hurry up before it gets dark.

225
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,600
So basically, running low means...

226
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,280
You don't have much of this left.

227
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,000
You don't have much of something left.

228
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,560
So here, they're running low on wine.

230
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,320
So basically...

231
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
There's not much wine left.

232
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Right.

233
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
So if you listen to the examples, you could also be running low on fuel, for example,

234
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,760
on your car, etc.

235
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Running low on.

236
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,320
All right, and now let's take a look at our last word.

237
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,840
Doing really well.

238
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,200
Doing really well.

239
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,120
We are doing really well.

240
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,240
Doing really well.

241
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,560
So this seems to be like a pretty simple structure.

242
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,560
I mean, we know all these words, right?

243
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,000
So why is it special?

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,160
Well basically, if you say, I am doing really well, maybe it sounds a little bit difficult

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
to understand.

246
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
But what are you doing really well?

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
So this is a great way of answering a question.

248
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
When somebody says, how are you?

249
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Or how are you doing?

250
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,400
You can say, I'm doing really well.

251
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,760
Or I'm doing well.

252
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
In your life, everything is good.

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,440
In your life, things are good and you're happy, basically.

254
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,000
But in this situation, in the dialogue, what's doing really well?

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
Well, the restaurant is doing really well.

256
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,100
The business is doing really well.

257
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,480
So when he says, we're doing really well, business is good.

258
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,760
They're making lots of money.

259
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Exactly.

260
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,400
So you can use it with people.

261
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,540
You can use it with businesses.

262
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,340
You can say, I'm doing really well in my new job.

263
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,560
Or my son is doing really well in school.

264
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Okay, so you can use it in those different ways.

265
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Alright, well, let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be able to hear all

266
00:09:46,600 --> 00:10:01,360
of these great words and phrases we just talked about.

267
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:29,200
So let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:48,080
So Marco, do you think this chef had a rat under his hat?

269
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,320
That was a really good movie, Ratatouille, Disney, Pixar, where a rat is a cook.

270
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,440
It's interesting, I love to cook, but I'm not very good at cooking.

271
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,800
But it's good because for me, it helps me relieve stress.

272
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Me too, actually.

273
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,360
You know, if I'm in a bad mood, I go home and cook something to eat and the world seems

274
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
a happier place.

275
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,880
And people don't understand it because they think cooking is work.

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,800
But for some people, it's fun.

277
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,840
So what about you guys?

278
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
What do you like to cook?

279
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,560
Do you have any particular dish that you prepare very well?

280
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,360
