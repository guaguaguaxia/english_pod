1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello English learners, welcome to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,220
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,220
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,120
So, Erika, how are you today?

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm doing pretty well.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,100
And I think we've got a good lesson today, a really helpful lesson.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,280
What are we talking about today?

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,120
We have an elementary lesson about making an appointment.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,680
Alright, making an appointment.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
Yeah, that's really helpful.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
I guess you have to make appointments for the doctor or...

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
At work maybe.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
At work, personal.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
Or with your friends, yeah.

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,200
So, this is language that you can use every day to make appointments.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Great.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,800
Well, so, why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,520
Vocabulary Preview.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,320
We only have one word today which you need to know to understand this dialogue.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,000
And it is financial advisor.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,920
Financial advisor.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,480
Financial advisor.

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
So, what is a financial advisor?

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,480
A financial advisor is a person who gives suggestions or recommendations about investing

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
money.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,920
Someone who wants you to put money in the stock market.

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Okay, great.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,720
I guess we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,200
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
because...

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,280
We'll come back and teach you all the important words.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,800
Hello?

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Fairbrook Consulting.

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
How may I help you?

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Yes, this is Julianne Horton.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,800
And I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. McNeely.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Certainly.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
What day were you thinking of?

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
How's Thursday?

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,280
Does she have any time available then?

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,760
Um, let me double check.

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,880
Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday.

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
How does next Monday work for you?

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Can't you do Tuesday?

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,840
Sure, Tuesday's perfect.

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,680
May I ask where you're calling from?

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Sure.

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Merton Financial Advisors.

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Oh.

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
Actually, Tuesday's no good.

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,920
Sorry about that.

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,240
Well, I guess Ms. McNeely does not want to speak to any financial advisors.

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Yeah, I guess she doesn't really want to invest in the stock market.

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,440
Or maybe she just gets too many phone calls from them.

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Yeah.

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
If you have money, I guess you'll get phone calls from people like that.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
I guess we don't have that problem, hey?

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
No, we don't.

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, let's start with our language takeaway for today.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,360
Language takeaway.

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
So four words today.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,120
The first one is available.

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Available.

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Available.

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Available.

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,880
Available, meaning that you are not busy.

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
That you're free.

69
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
You're free.

70
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
You're not busy.

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Exactly.

72
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Let's move to our next word.

73
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Double check.

74
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Double check.

75
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Double check.

76
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Double check.

77
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,840
I think we've got some examples of this phrase.

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,000
Example one.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do you have the tickets?

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,760
I think so, but let me just double check.

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,680
Example two.

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,400
I thought I sent that email already, but let me double check.

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Okay, so double check basically means to check something twice.

84
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Exactly.

85
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
To check it again.

86
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Check it again.

87
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Okay.

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Our third word for language takeaway today is scheduled.

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Scheduled.

90
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Scheduled.

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Scheduled.

92
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
S-C-H-E-D-U-L-D.

93
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Scheduled.

94
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Scheduled.

95
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
So, when you have something scheduled, it means that you have something planned, right?

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Yeah, or booked at that time.

97
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Booked at that time.

98
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Yeah.

99
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
We've got a lunch scheduled this afternoon, don't we?

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Yes, we do.

101
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
All right.

102
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
A great lunch.

103
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Looking forward to it.

104
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,240
And our last word for today is booked solid.

105
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Booked solid.

106
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Booked solid.

107
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
B-O-O-K-E-D.

108
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Booked solid.

109
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
So, we have some great words for today.

110
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
We have a great word for today.

111
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
We have a great word for today.

112
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
We have a great word for today.

113
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
We have a great phrase for today, which is booked solid.

114
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,240
So, we have some great examples on how you can use this great phrase, booked solid, and

115
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
you can understand what it means.

116
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Example one.

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I can't get a hotel room.

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,240
They're booked solid until after the New Year.

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Example two.

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I'm sorry, there are no seats available on this flight.

121
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm booked solid over the Christmas holidays.

122
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Example three.

123
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Sorry, I can't meet with you today.

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm booked solid.

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Okay, great.

126
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
So, booked solid basically is?

127
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,240
You have no free time, no available time.

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Right.

129
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
So, you've got appointments scheduled all day.

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
All day, great.

131
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Mm-hmm.

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
So, with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue a second time.

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:19,240
This time, it's going to be slow, so we can understand a little bit better.

134
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting.

135
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
How may I help you?

136
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Yes, this is Julianne Horton, and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. McNeely.

137
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Certainly.

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
What date were you thinking of?

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
How's Thursday?

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Does she have any time available then?

141
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Um, let me double check.

142
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
No, unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday.

143
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,240
How does next Monday work for you?

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Can she do Tuesday?

146
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Sure, Tuesday's perfect.

147
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
May I ask where you're calling from?

148
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Sure, Merton Financial Advisors.

149
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh.

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Actually, Tuesday's no good.

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Sorry about that.

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Okay, so now it's a little bit more clear, and with this, we can start with putting it together.

153
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Putting it together.

154
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:33,240
There's some great examples in this dialogue of phrases you can use when you need to schedule an appointment, and we're going to look at those today.

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,240
In the dialogue, we heard Julianne ask about making an appointment, and she said this.

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. McNeely.

157
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,240
I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. McNeely.

158
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,240
So this is a great way to schedule an appointment, to ask for some time from somebody else.

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Yeah, and we have some more examples of this phrase.

160
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Example one.

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Please book an appointment for next week.

162
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Example two.

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Please schedule an appointment for next week.

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Great, so after that, when you're scheduling an appointment, you need to suggest a day when maybe that person has time.

165
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes, let's listen to what they said in the dialogue.

166
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:34,240
How's Thursday? Does she have any time available then?

167
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
You say, well, how's Thursday or how's Tuesday?

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
And maybe that person doesn't have time that day, so they'll say something like this.

169
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Can't you do Tuesday?

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Okay, Erica, so if I want to have a meeting with you, I would say, how's Monday sound or how's Monday?

171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Monday's no good. I'm busy all day.

172
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
How's Tuesday?

173
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Sorry, Tuesday's no good either.

174
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
What about Wednesday?

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Okay, Wednesday works.

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
All right, great.

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Wednesday's perfect.

178
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Okay, great, so we have a meeting on Wednesday.

179
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Okay, yeah, those are some great phrases, hey, for scheduling an appointment.

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Yeah, they're really good.

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Okay, so now we can listen to our dialogue a third time and we're ready to understand everything that we've just talked about.

182
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Hello, Fairbrook Consulting. How may I help you?

183
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Yes, this is Julianne Horton, and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. McNeely.

184
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Certainly. What day were you thinking of?

185
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
How's Thursday? Does she have any time available then?

186
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Um, let me double check.

187
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday. How does next Monday work for you?

188
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday. Can't you do Tuesday?

189
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Sure, Tuesday's perfect. May I ask where you're calling from?

190
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Sure, Merton Financial Advisors.

191
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Oh, actually, Tuesday's no good. Sorry about that.

192
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
The language in this dialogue is really useful, isn't it, Marco?

193
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Yeah, it's from an everyday situation. You always have to make appointments at some point.

194
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Yes, and like we said earlier, it's language you can use when you need to talk about work with your boss, maybe.

195
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Right.

196
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Or when you need to do daily things, like go to the doctor.

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Or even when you're planning something with your friends.

198
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Right.

199
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Yeah, you can use this in all those situations.

200
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
In all situations.

201
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Uh-huh.

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Great. Well, we're out of time now, but I hope you enjoyed our lesson and found it useful.
