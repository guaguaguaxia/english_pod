00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,800
And we're bringing you the final lesson of our job interview series.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
That's right.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,560
And in this lesson, we're going to be focusing on two very, very common, but sometimes difficult

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
questions.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,320
Okay, so we've talked about preparing for the job interview in part one.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,100
Part two, we talked about educational background and work experience.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,240
And in part three, what are we going to be looking at?

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,720
We're going to be looking at two questions, why we should hire you and your greatest weakness.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:42,040
Okay, so these are the classic common questions that you'll get at a job interview, right?

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
That's right.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,280
So why don't we just get started and we'll take a listen to the dialogue and see how

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:58,080
our interviewee handles these questions.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Very good.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,400
Now, I have a couple of final questions.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,840
I hope they're not too hard.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,140
Well, why should we hire you?

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,880
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,760
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,460
You know, I excel at building strong, long-term consumer relationships.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,500
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,480
resolved about 70% of our customers' problems.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,420
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,680
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,480
department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,280
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,760
Impressive.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,120
So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,400
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,160
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,080
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
management.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,520
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
time efficiently.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,800
So, I think I'm getting better now.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
Great.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,600
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,140
We are shortlisting our candidates this week.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,260
And next week, we will inform our shortlisted candidates of the day and time for a second

43
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,000
interview with our CEO.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Great.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thanks a lot.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I hope to hear from you.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,040
Goodbye.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:53,840
Well, our interviewee is doing very well, but I think he had a little bit too many beans

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
or chili.

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Oh my God.

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,300
Like, this is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of.

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,720
But he doesn't say anything.

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
So, I don't know.

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,640
Maybe he should have said, oh, pardon me, excuse me or something.

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
I don't know.

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
I don't know.

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
It's a controversy.

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Yeah.

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Okay.

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,600
But what isn't a controversy is the language because there's some great stuff in here.

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
All right.

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,920
Let's take a look at the language in Language Takeaway.

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Language Takeaway.

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,840
All right.

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,200
We've got some great phrases and words for you to use when you're talking about what

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,520
sort of benefits and skills and experience and expertise you can bring to a company.

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Okay.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,480
The first thing that he said, and it's a very interesting word, he said, technical acumen.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Technical acumen.

70
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Acumen.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Acumen.

72
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a really hard word.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
What is acumen?

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:53,840
It's basically insight and understanding and the ability to make good and difficult decisions.

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Okay.

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,800
So, he has a very strong technical acumen.

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,960
So, a strong insight or understanding of technical issues.

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Okay.

79
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,120
Or I can change it and may say, I have a very strong business acumen.

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Exactly.

81
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,160
So, these are the two most common ways that this word is used, technical acumen, business

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
acumen.

83
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Okay.

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Great.

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,320
Now, let's take a look at another word which is very interesting because everybody knows

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
it.

87
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Yes.

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Excel.

89
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Excel.

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Excel.

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Excel.

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Now, Excel is, of course, the software that you use, right?

93
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Yeah.

94
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,800
But here, it's a verb meaning to be really, really good at something.

95
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Right.

96
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,280
To be the best maybe.

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Yeah.

98
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,880
To excel at something.

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Yes.

100
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
So, I excel at cooking.

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
All right.

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,680
So, Excel, you are the best.

103
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,040
That's not really going to help me in a job interview, but the next word might.

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Head.

105
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Head.

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Well, in the dialogue, we heard it as headed in the past, right?

107
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Yeah.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
That's right.

109
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,280
He headed the customer support department.

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:04,520
So, I think this is a great word to use when you were saying, I was the leader.

111
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,840
I was the main person in charge.

112
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Yeah, the manager.

113
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,640
So, this is a nice verb to use to show that you were leading something.

114
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Okay.

115
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Okay.

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,320
Now, for the next word.

117
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
Struggle.

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
To struggle.

119
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Struggle.

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Struggle.

121
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,700
So, what does struggle mean?

122
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,040
It means that you have difficulty doing something.

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,120
So, it's hard for you.

124
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Yeah.

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,640
For example, when I was in school, I struggled with math.

126
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Okay.

127
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,520
And now, I struggle with Chinese.

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Exactly.

129
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
So, to have a hard time.

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Yeah.

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,720
Why don't we hear a couple of examples of how this word is used?

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,640
Example one.

133
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,320
We're really struggling to reach our sales target.

134
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Example two.

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah, to be honest, I do struggle with time management.

136
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,760
Example three.

137
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,320
The teacher farted in class and I really had to struggle not to laugh.

138
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,800
Okay.

139
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
So, great examples.

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Let's move on to our next word.

141
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Punctuality.

142
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Punctuality.

143
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Punctuality.

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Punctuality.

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay.

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,680
So, to be punctual.

147
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,600
It means to be on time, always.

148
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Always.

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,520
So, punctuality would be the noun form.

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Right.

151
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,800
So, the condition or the state of always being on time.

152
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Right.

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,240
So, punctuality, to be punctual.

154
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Yeah.

155
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
And our interviewee struggles with punctuality.

156
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Right.

157
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Like me.

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,560
I guess you guys have something in common.

159
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
We do.

160
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,680
Now, he has a problem with punctuality, but he said he has addressed this weakness.

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,160
Yes, to address.

162
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Address.

163
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Address.

164
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Now, if you notice, it's spelled the same way as address.

165
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,200
That's right.

166
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
But you pronounce it differently.

167
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,280
So, the verb address has the stress on the second syllable.

168
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay.

169
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Address.

170
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Yes.

171
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
And that means to...

172
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Deal with.

173
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
To deal with the problem.

174
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Yeah.

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
To acknowledge the problem.

176
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Yeah.

177
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
And to try and solve it.

178
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
And to try and solve it.

179
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay.

180
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
So, different from your home address where you live.

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Yeah.

182
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
And there, the stress is on the first syllable.

183
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Address.

184
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Right.

185
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Perfect.

186
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Very good.

187
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Okay.

188
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,800
So, let's listen to this dialogue one more time, and then we'll come back and talk about

189
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,440
these two questions.

190
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:54,720
Greatest weakness and why should we hire you?

191
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Very good.

192
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,880
So, I have a couple of final questions.

193
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,360
I hope they're not too hard.

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,640
Well, why should we hire you?

195
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,400
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,840
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

197
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,960
I excel at building strong, long-term consumer relationships.

198
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,000
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
resolved about 70% of our customers' problems.

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,920
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

201
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,240
So after, I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
department.

203
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,080
We were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

204
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,520
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

205
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,840
Impressive.

206
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,640
So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

207
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,960
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

208
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,080
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

209
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

210
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,600
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,940
management.

212
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,040
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my

213
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
time efficiently.

214
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,960
So, I think I'm getting better now.

215
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
Great.

216
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,080
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
We are shortlisting our candidates this week.

218
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,760
And next week, we will inform our shortlisted candidates of the day and time for a second

219
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,480
interview with our CEO.

220
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Great.

221
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Thanks a lot.

222
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I hope to hear from you.

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Goodbye.

224
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,320
All right, Marco.

225
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,920
Well, this classic question, why should we hire you?

226
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,860
I think you'll hear it in many, many different interviews.

227
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,560
And how did he deal with it here?

228
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,440
Well, the first thing that he said is very, very important because they're asking you

229
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,720
why so your immediate reaction would be to answer with because or I think that.

230
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
But there's a different way of approaching it, which is a little bit more professional.

231
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,760
He said, I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,380
I think I would be a perfect fit in this company.

233
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,760
That's how he started his answer.

234
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,440
And then he explained why.

235
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,760
So this sounds really strong, doesn't it?

236
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,400
Yeah, basically, it just makes you seem to be very confident and puts you like you are

237
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,160
already part of the company.

238
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,220
So this is a great way to start off this question.

239
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,300
But you got to follow this up with some information.

240
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,760
So what kind of information should you be giving?

241
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,360
Well, like we talked about in your work experience, the same thing goes here.

242
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,960
What do you have to offer to this company?

243
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,480
What special skills or insights or experience can you bring that would help us?

244
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,360
Yeah, that nobody else can bring.

245
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Exactly.

246
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,320
So again, you have to start talking about your strengths and your previous experience,

247
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,040
but with examples, right?

248
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,520
Very, very specific examples.

249
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:05,360
And whenever you can throw in some numbers or some specific successes that you have had.

250
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Exactly.

251
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,680
And once you've talked about these things, you can close off this answer by saying, given

252
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,040
the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

253
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,080
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

254
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,260
So that is just like a magical sentence saying like, if you give me the chance, I will demonstrate

255
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,280
how good I am and how I can help this company.

256
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Yes.

257
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,640
A really, really strong closing argument.

258
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Yes.

259
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,480
So that's the way you should more or less approach that question, right?

260
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,680
All right, but let's turn now to the classic, classic question.

261
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Your greatest weakness.

262
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
What is your greatest weakness?

263
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,140
When you get this question, be sure to not say, my greatest weakness is I work too much.

264
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,840
My greatest weakness is I'm a workaholic.

265
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Right.

266
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Or what was it?

267
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,760
Oh, or I am a perfectionist.

268
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, these we can see right through these.

269
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,480
I mean, they're too obvious and they're too, they're too silly.

270
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,880
I mean, everyone has a weakness, so don't try and turn it around into a strength.

271
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,680
I just don't think that's a good idea.

272
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Okay.

273
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,960
So yeah, be sure to stay away from these answers, but you can say anything.

274
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,240
Like in this case, he has a problem with being on time.

275
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Yeah.

276
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
So be honest, say what one of your greatest weaknesses are.

277
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,760
But the key to making this weakness look good is saying what you are doing to solve this

278
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
weakness.

279
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Exactly.

280
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
So really be truthful.

281
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,460
Tell the interviewer what you're not good at because there's obviously something that

282
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
you're not good at.

283
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,460
Exactly.

284
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,280
So you can say, I am usually late, but I am getting more organized.

285
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,960
I am doing the seminar.

286
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,000
Let the interviewer know that you are trying to improve this weakness.

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Exactly.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,520
And be sure to also think about your strength, right?

289
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah.

290
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,280
Be prepared to answer the question, what is your greatest strength?

291
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,280
So and again, when you're talking about your strengths, be sure it's something more specific

292
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,120
than saying, oh, I'm very responsible.

293
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Yeah.

294
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,640
You want to be as specific as you can.

295
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,280
And again, give those examples, give those successes, give those numbers.

296
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Right.

297
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Exactly.

298
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,640
So think about your weaknesses.

299
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,120
Think about your strengths.

300
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,000
If you don't know them, ask people, ask your colleagues or ask your friends, what do you

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,480
think is my greatest strength?

302
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
Maybe you're a funny person.

303
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
That's a strength.

304
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Yes.

305
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,960
Well, remember there are three parts to this interviewing series and you can find them

306
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,200

307

Good luck in your interviews and until next time.

315
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Goodbye.

316
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,720
Cheers.
