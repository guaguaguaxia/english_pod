00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Catherine and today we're talking a little bit about more small talk.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,200
That's right.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
We're going to continue our series.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,300
This is part nine, so we're coming close to the end of our 10-part series.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,260
And today we're following Melissa and Michelle as they discuss very casually their personal

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,500
life specifically about their marriages or getting married.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
That's right.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,680
So this one's a little bit more difficult than the last few.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,640
Let's take a listen to the dialogue and when we come back we'll be talking about some of

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,080
those phrases that you heard.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,480
Hey, Michelle.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:45,120
Jump in quick.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,280
It's pouring out there.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,840
Oh, hi, Melissa.

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
Are you going to the conference too?

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,400
I was planning to pick up Mr. Campbell.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,560
Yes, he told me.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,920
We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,240
Oh, I see.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Okay.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
So I heard you got married.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Congratulations.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,160
Oh, thank you.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm very excited.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,280
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
instead.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
It was wonderful.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,280
That sounds so romantic.

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,860
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,360
We just don't have the money.

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,760
I know what you mean.

34
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,000
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't you?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I sure do.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,520
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Definitely.

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,040
Oh, there's Mr. Campbell.

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,200
Driver, can you stop here, please?

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
All right, we're back.

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
So a lot of interesting phrases in this dialogue more than vocab.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,760
So we're going to have two fluency builders.

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,640
Let's start with the first one now.

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,240
Fluency Builder.

46
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,360
The first phrase in today's fluency builder is the phrase jump in.

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,400
So Melissa says, hey, Michelle, jump in quick.

48
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
That's right.

49
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,000
So Melissa is actually in a taxi and that's why she's saying jump in quick.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,160
So she is directing Michelle to do something.

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
She's saying jump in.

52
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,600
So it's actually her telling Melissa, get in the car.

53
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
That's right.

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,440
And so we can use this phrase to jump in somewhere, which means you're going to do it very quickly.

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,840
Yeah, to go somewhere, to get in a place very quickly.

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,720
We could say it about a cab, but we could also say it about a swimming pool.

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,000
Maybe I'm swimming in the water and I say, Marco, jump in.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
The water's nice.

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
That's right.

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,180
Or maybe you just got back from the gym and you're going to jump in the shower really

61
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,240
quick and before you go out again.

62
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,360
You're not actually going to jump like you jump the action, but you're going to get into

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,080
the shower very quickly.

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
That's right.

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,840
And of course, Melissa tells Michelle to jump in the cab quickly because it's pouring out

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,920
there.

67
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
It's pouring.

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
What's pouring?

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
The rain.

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
Pouring water, pouring wine.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,160
It's actually, yeah, it's pouring water out there.

73
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,600
It means it's raining very, very hard.

74
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,480
Okay, so it's not just drizzling a little, little bit.

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,760
It's raining very hard.

76
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
It's pouring rain.

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,960
Okay, so we don't have to say the word rain.

78
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,640
We can just say it's pouring.

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
That's right.

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,320
As you can see in that sentence, Melissa doesn't say at any time it's raining, but we understand

81
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,520
that when somebody says it's pouring out there, you know that it means it's raining very hard.

82
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Can't be chocolate.

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,160
Can't be chocolate, can't be dogs or cats, right?

84
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
No.

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,400
All right, so Michelle gets in the cab and she says, well, we have to pick up Mr. Campbell.

86
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,320
And Melissa says, yep, we need to pick him up at the hotel.

87
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,160
All right, the verb here is to pick up.

88
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,640
Now we want to just remember this as a phrasal verb.

89
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,560
You pick someone up in your car, you could even pick someone up on your bicycle.

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
That's right, that's right.

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,160
So, but you can see that you can say we need to pick up Tommy at the hotel or you can say

92
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,060
we need to pick Tommy up.

93
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,160
So you can use it both ways.

94
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,540
You can put the noun in between or after.

95
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,720
So can you pick me up at five?

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, right.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,320
Or can you pick up the clothes at the dry cleaners?

98
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
That's right.

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,680
It means to go collect something.

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
That's right.

101
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,280
So you can use it in different ways.

102
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,760
You can put the noun in between pick up or you can put it after.

103
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,400
And all right, so they're going to go pick up Mr. Campbell.

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,040
Now they're talking, well, they're kind of gossiping a little bit.

105
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,120
They said, well, I heard you got married.

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
All right, so I heard.

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Now this is a very, very common way to start a sentence that might have some gossip in

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
it.

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,360
So I'm going to say something that might or might not be true.

110
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
That's right.

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,640
So you're not really sure if it's true or not.

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,440
So this is why you start with the sentence, I heard that something, something, something.

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,080
So in this case, you said, I heard you got married.

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,160
Or I heard you got married because I'm basically saying, well, some rumor made it to me and

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,800
I heard that you got married, but I'm not sure.

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
So she's asking, did you get married?

117
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,920
If so, congratulations.

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
That's right.

119
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
That's right.

120
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,420
So it's a very common way of starting a sentence when you are talking to someone and maybe

121
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,840
you want them to confirm this news or this gossip or this rumor is true or not.

122
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,160
I heard you got a promotion.

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
That's right.

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Congratulations.

125
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,200
So that's the way that you use this phrase.

126
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,120
I heard you or well, if you're using another person, I heard that Tom got divorced.

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,400
I heard Susie had a baby.

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
That's right.

129
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
All right.

130
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
So that's all for the first part of Fluency Builder.

131
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:56,120
Let's take a break and we'll be back in a bit with part two.

132
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Hey Michelle, jumping quick.

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,320
It's pouring out there.

134
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,760
Oh, hi Melissa.

135
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,560
Are you going to the conference too?

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,360
I was planning to pick up Mr. Campbell.

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Yes.

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Actually, we need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

139
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Oh, I see.

140
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Okay.

141
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,760
So I heard you got married.

142
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Congratulations.

143
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,120
Oh, thank you.

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm very excited.

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,200
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday

146
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
instead.

147
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,240
It was wonderful.

148
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
That sounds so romantic.

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,820
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

150
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,320
We just don't have the money.

151
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,680
I know what you mean.

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,920
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't you?

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I sure do.

155
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,520
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

156
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Definitely.

157
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh, there's Mr. Campbell.

158
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,440
Driver, can you stop here, please?

159
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,080
All right.

160
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,200
So now we're back with part two of Fluency Builder.

161
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,880
Let's get started with the first phrase.

162
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,000
When she says that they got married on holiday, what does that mean?

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,480
On holiday is another way of saying on vacation.

164
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,520
So while we were having a holiday somewhere, this happened.

165
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,480
So you could say, we decided to get married on holiday.

166
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,560
That means when they were traveling, when they were on vacation, they got married.

167
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,320
So it's kind of more of a British way of saying, right?

168
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
On holiday?

169
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Yes.

170
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,760
You could say, where did you go on holiday?

171
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,600
But maybe in America, we'd prefer to say, where did you go on vacation?

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
On vacation.

173
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
So both are correct.

174
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,080
You can say, we got married while on holiday or we got married while on vacation.

175
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Both are correct.

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,400
It's just a little bit of difference between British English and American English.

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,480
And then moving on, she said, well, they also wanted to get married, Michelle did, but they

178
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,200
had to postpone their wedding.

179
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Okay.

180
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,160
To postpone something means to wait until later to do it.

181
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,680
So you maybe want to do it today, but it's raining today.

182
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,520
So you have to postpone until next week.

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
That's right.

184
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,480
So it's kind of like you had to delay, you had to wait.

185
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Yeah, that's right.

186
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,880
So you could say that because of bad weather, the picnic will be postponed until next month.

187
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Okay.

188
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,280
So that's the way they use postpone.

189
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
Now it's interesting because you have a P in between there, so it's postpone.

190
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Postpone.

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,080
Yeah, it's an interesting word to pronounce.

192
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Okay.

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,880
And well, they also had to postpone it because of money.

194
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,040
It's just very expensive.

195
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,400
And Melissa agrees by saying, I know what you mean.

196
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,040
I know what you mean.

197
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,600
Now this is a really common phrase and this is something you'll hear with more relaxed

198
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
conversations between friends.

199
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,000
It means I understand the situation or I feel the same way.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So in this case, we just don't have the money.

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
Melissa's saying, I know what you mean.

202
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,720
It means I'm having a hard time with money too.

203
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,400
I don't have much money either.

204
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
That's right.

205
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,160
So you understand what she's talking about.

206
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,520
You also agree.

207
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,120
I know what you mean.

208
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,160
It's just a way of agreeing with someone.

209
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
All right.

210
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,400
And then she goes on to confirm what Michelle is saying by saying, I think Shanghai is getting

211
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
more and more expensive.

212
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
All right.

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Now this is a really, really key sentence structure here.

214
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
We have more and more, more and more.

215
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
And then after that we have an adjective.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
So the structure is more and more adjectives.

217
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,960
So more and more spicy, more and more funny, more and more expensive.

218
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,440
So in this case, the city is more expensive than it was before.

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
That's right.

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
And it's still getting more expensive.

221
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
That's right.

222
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,220
That's the main idea when you use this structure is that when you say more and more and then

223
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,240
you add an adjective such as expensive or beautiful, it means that it continues to grow.

224
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,800
It continues to get more expensive or more beautiful or more difficult.

225
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,560
But remember that we are using adjectives here that are when you're using the comparative,

226
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
you can't say, for example, you can't use funny.

227
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
You can't say you are getting more and more funny because obviously the comparative for

228
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
funny is funnier.

229
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,520
So just be careful with that one because it could be a little bit confusing.

230
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
All right.

231
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,240
So and to finish off our fluency builder, we have Michelle who agrees with Melissa and

232
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,280
says, yeah, you know, I think Shanghai is getting more expensive.

233
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,900
And she says, I sure do.

234
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
So she's basically agreeing.

235
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,320
She's saying, yes, that's true.

236
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
But why?

237
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,960
Why does she say I sure do?

238
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
Why doesn't she say agree?

239
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,640
I agree or yeah, you're right.

240
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Well, she doesn't have to say it because she says I do.

241
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,520
The question before that was, I think something, something, don't you?

242
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,040
And she says, I do.

243
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
And I think that.

244
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,920
So it's assumed that she also thinks this.

245
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
She's answering a question.

246
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
That's right.

247
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,880
So that's an interesting way of asking a question when you say, I think the city is beautiful.

248
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Don't you?

249
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,840
So the proper way to answer that would be I do or I sure do.

250
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
All right.

251
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,680
So that's all the time we have for fluency builder.

252
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,880
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

253
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:27,400
Hey, Michelle, jumping quick.

254
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
It's pouring out there.

255
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh, hi, Melissa.

256
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,880
Are you going to the conference too?

257
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,600
I was planning to pick up Mr. Campbell.

258
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes, he told me we need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

259
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,560
Oh, I see.

260
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,120
OK, so I heard you got married.

261
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Congratulations.

262
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,400
Oh, thank you.

263
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm very excited.

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,520
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday

265
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
instead.

266
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
It was wonderful.

267
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,560
That sounds so romantic.

268
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,120
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

269
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,620
We just don't have the money.

270
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,000
I know what you mean.

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,240
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

272
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Don't you?

273
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
I sure do.

274
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,880
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

275
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Definitely.

276
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
Oh, there's Mr. Campbell.

277
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,000
Driver, can you stop here, please?

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,960
All right, so we're reaching the end of our small talk series.

279
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,560
In this case, it's two women who are talking about their personal lives.

280
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,400
And not only that, they're talking about weddings and they're talking about money.

281
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,960
So this is a very interesting way to talk about these very common topics, personal life,

282
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,000
love and especially money.

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,360
But remember, in American culture, these are the kinds of things you would only talk to

284
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
your friends about.

285
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,280
You wouldn't really want to talk to strangers about money, personal life, marriage, because

286
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,720
those are considered private.

287
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,880
So be careful when you're talking to people you don't know very well.

288
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
That's right.

289
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,240
And actually, your feedback was very interesting when we discussed about if it's okay to ask,

290
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,760
for example, a woman her age or her weight or a man's salary.

291
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,280
So in most places, you said that it wasn't really correct.

292
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,560
But this is the very interesting thing about the cultural differences and what is appropriate

293
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
to talk about.

294
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
That's right.

295
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,840
So again, if you have any questions or comments about the things we talked about here today

296
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,880
or any of our older lessons about small talk, please just let us know.

297
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

298
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
All right, guys.

299
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
We'll see you there.

300
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:47,540
And thanks for watching Polish English.
