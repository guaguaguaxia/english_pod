00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,260
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,640
And today we don't feel very good.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
That's right.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,400
Actually, in this lesson we're talking about a hangover.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,680
Hangover, wow, that's an interesting word.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
What does that mean?

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,760
Well, when you drink beer or wine or vodka, and you drink too much of it, the next morning

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
you have a hangover.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,280
Aha, okay, so a lot of our listeners have probably experienced a hangover before.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,920
It's very likely.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
But the problem is when you have to go to work the next day.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,280
Yes, and you might need to actually miss work, but you need some good words and phrases to

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,680
describe how bad you feel.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,420
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,120
We have a guy describing his hangover and why he missed work that day.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
Are you okay, man?

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,280
You don't look very well.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,280
I feel terrible.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:23,280
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Nice, so where did you guys go?

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,000
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
Everything was cool until Mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
yesterday.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh no, Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
Tell me about it.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,460
We drank everything in the bar.

29
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,960
Is that why you missed work today?

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
I threw up like five times.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
day.

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,280
I swear, I am never going to drink again.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
Too bad, man.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,320
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Oh yeah?

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
I'm there.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:15,480
All right, so he's never drinking again, but then at the next chance for a party, he's

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,800
already ready to go.

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I think that's the typical lie of every person that drinks.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,560
They say, I'll never drink again, but a week later or a month later, there they are again.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Or a day later.

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,720
All right, so we saw some great vocab here, so let's look at it now in Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm going to look at five words here.

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,960
Now, the first one, they talked about how Mike's birthday is a drink fest.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,680
A drink fest.

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
It's a drink fest.

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,160
All right, so we have this word, drink fest.

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,480
Now, what is this fest part?

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,120
Well, maybe you recognize the word, Oktoberfest.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,600
Okay, or festival.

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,360
So fest is like a party.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
There's lots of food.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
There's lots of drink.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,880
A drink fest is an event where there's a lot of drinks.

58
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,640
Okay, so can I have different types of fests?

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,160
Yeah, this is a really informal sort of slang way of saying there's lots of something.

60
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,520
So I could say, oh my God, it's a puppy fest.

61
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,280
So there are a lot of puppies.

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,560
Or I can say like a fast food fest.

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay, so you're eating a lot of fast food.

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
There's a lot of fast food.

65
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,080
All right, so fest, interesting.

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,880
Now, when he was describing his hangover, he said that he felt really nauseous.

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Nauseous.

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Nauseous.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,320
Now, I always have a hard time spelling this word.

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,600
So N-A-U-S-E-O-U-S, nauseous.

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Nauseous.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,920
It kind of seems like you should say nauseous.

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Right, but-

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,360
But you say nauseous.

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Yeah.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Okay, so when you're feeling nauseous, what do you feel like?

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
So you feel dizzy.

78
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,960
You don't feel very well.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
Like your stomach hurts.

80
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah, and your head is kind of spinning.

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,240
Okay, and you feel like you might throw up.

82
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,640
Right, exactly.

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,000
Now this word that you just mentioned, throw up, is actually our next word and well, we're

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
not going to describe it.

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,560
Why don't we just listen to a person throwing up?

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh, Marco, that was horrible.

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, that's the only way we could actually explain throw up.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,280
It's kind of a hard word to explain, but I'm sure everyone understands now what it means,

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
right?

90
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,640
Okay, the word is to throw up.

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
To throw up.

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
To throw up.

93
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Our next word.

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,520
Now, our guy who's hungover, he said, I was so dehydrated.

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,400
Dehydrated.

96
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
To be dehydrated.

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,440
So this is an adjective and it means that I have no water in my body.

98
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Exactly.

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
Okay, so I am dehydrated.

100
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
I need water.

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,040
That common feeling after drinking too much beer, huh?

102
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Exactly.

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Now our final word.

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,840
He said he had a headache and he said, my head's been pounding all day.

105
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,760
Okay, so his head has been pounding all day.

106
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,720
Now this verb, pounding, it sounds like this.

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:26,400
Alright, so a clear example of what your head feels like when you have this very bad headache.

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,200
You can also say, I have a pounding headache.

109
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,680
I have a pounding headache.

110
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Exactly.

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Or my head is pounding.

112
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,100
Alright so five great words that we just looked at right now.

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,400
So why don't we listen to our dialogue a second time.

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:51,760
Let's slow it down just a little bit and then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

115
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Are you okay, man?

116
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,400
You don't look very well.

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
I feel terrible.

118
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,000
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Nice.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
So where did you guys go?

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,400
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Everything was cool until Mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
yesterday.

124
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Oh no.

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,680
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

126
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,800
Tell me about it.

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,840
We drank everything in the bar.

128
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,360
Is that why you missed work today?

129
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

130
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,800
I threw up like five times.

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Ew.

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,320
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all

133
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
day.

134
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,680
I swear I am never going to drink again.

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
Too bad, man.

136
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,640
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

137
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Oh yeah?

138
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm there.

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,680
Alright, well that was a little easier to understand this time.

140
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Now you mentioned that we've got some great phrases so let's go to them now in Fluency

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,840
Builder.

142
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Fluency Builder.

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Alright, so as we heard in the dialogue, the party was, I think it was a great party, right?

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Well, it sounds like it was fantastic.

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Well, apparently it was a great party and he said that he went out with Trevor and things

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,640
got a little out of hand.

147
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,360
Things got a little out of hand.

148
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,080
Right, so things got a little out of hand.

149
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,240
Now to get out of hand, what's that mean?

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,440
Well, we have some examples so let's listen to a couple of them before we explain it.

151
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Example 1.

152
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,560
Honey, the kids are getting a little out of hand.

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Can you do something?

154
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,280
Example 2.

155
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Guys, this argument is getting out of hand.

156
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,080
Let's all calm down.

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,920
Example 3.

158
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,640
The party last night got out of hand.

159
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,480
The neighbors called the police.

160
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Okay, so when things get out of hand, you lose control.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,400
Exactly, they get out of control just a little bit maybe.

162
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,760
Yeah, go a little crazy.

163
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,520
Alright so things got a little out of hand.

164
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,480
Now the opposite of this was everything was cool.

165
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
Everything was cool.

166
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
So everything was cool.

167
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,200
So basically everything was okay, everything was relaxed, everything was going fine.

168
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,640
Exactly, and then Mike came along and then things got a little out of hand.

169
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Oh, that Mike.

170
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,280
And now for our last phrase.

171
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,800
He was describing that Mike's birthday party was a drink fest, right?

172
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,320
And then his friend agreed.

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,480
He said, tell me about it.

174
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Tell me about it.

175
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
Tell me about it.

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,640
Now what does this mean exactly when he says tell me about it?

177
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,320
Basically it means I completely understand.

178
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,360
I completely agree with you.

179
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
So I could say, oh my god Marco, it's so hot outside today.

180
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
And I would say, I know, tell me about it.

181
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,760
So I'm saying, yeah, I agree with you, you are right.

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Very good.

183
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,200
So these phrases, okay, so three great phrases that we just looked at.

184
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
bit more.

186
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:24,080
Are you okay, man?

187
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,480
You don't look very well.

188
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,200
I feel terrible.

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,960
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

190
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Nice.

191
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,520
So where did you guys go?

192
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,440
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

193
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,640
Everything was cool until Mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday

194
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
yesterday.

195
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Oh no.

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,720
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
Tell me about it.

198
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,880
We drank everything in the bar.

199
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,400
Is that why you missed work today?

200
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,920
I threw up like five times.

202
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Ew.

203
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,360
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all

204
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
day.

205
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,720
I swear, I am never going to drink again.

206
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Too bad, man.

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

208
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Oh yeah?

209
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm there.

210
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,120
So it sounds like these guys sure like to go out and have a few drinks, don't they?

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,360
Yeah, exactly.

212
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:33,520
And I think this is a very common thing among young people, usually in the United States.

213
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,760
After a day at the office or something, they'll go or even in Europe, they'll go to the pub,

214
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
right?

215
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Yeah.

216
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,880
But the thing is that in America and Canada, we're very careful about alcohol and young

217
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,160
people, right?

218
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
Yeah, exactly.

219
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,560
The legal drinking age in the most part of the United States is 21 years of age.

220
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,240
And really, many parents or families will never let their children drink alcohol until

221
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
they're 21.

222
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Right.

223
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,440
And also the laws that control alcohol, like for example, on television, if you notice

224
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,360
a TV commercial with a beer or a wine, you will never see the person actually drinking

225
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
it.

226
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
It's illegal.

227
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Yeah, that's true.

228
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
While in other countries, it's okay.

229
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,840
You'll see people drinking it and having fun.

230
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,600
In these commercials, they can only maybe put them close to their lips but not drink

231
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
it.

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Interesting.

233
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,360
I mean, another weird thing is that sometimes you might want to sit in your back garden

234
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,660
or out on your porch and have a beer after work, right?

235
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,160
But in places, it's totally illegal to do that.

236
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
You can't be outside with alcohol.

237
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Right.

238
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,480
You can't be seen drinking or you can't be on the sidewalk or on a bus drinking.

239
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,880
While in other places, you can, right?

240
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,760
You can just have a beer on the subway.

241
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,520
So it's a little bit different policies on alcohol control.

242
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,640
What do you guys think about it?

243
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,920
Do you think it's correct or do you think maybe it's a little bit too exaggerated?

244
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

245
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Alright.

246
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,920
We'll see you guys there and until next time.

247
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.
