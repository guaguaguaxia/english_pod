00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,820
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,820
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,820
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,280
Today we're bringing you part two of another great lesson that we had.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,800
Yes, new guy in town.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,120
The new guy in town.

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
Part two.

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
Part two.

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Kind of a creepy story.

11
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Yes.

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,080
Yeah, and this one is also a little bit strange, a little bit weird.

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
Yeah, unusual outcome, unusual ending.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,320
But it has to do a lot with invitations.

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
That's right.

16
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,280
An invitation is when you ask somebody to do something with you.

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Right.

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,480
A dinner invitation.

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,520
So we're going to be talking about invitations and inviting people to do things.

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Okay.

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,120
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, Arman, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,520
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Don't you think so, Ellen?

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Oh, yes, of course.

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
We'd love to come over.

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
Can I bring anything?

28
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
No, don't worry about it.

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
I'll take care of everything.

30
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
I'll see you tonight.

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Come with an appetite.

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
I know I will.

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

34
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
He gives me the creeps.

35
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Why on earth did you accept?

36
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Oh, come on, Ellen.

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
It'll be nice to get to know him.

38
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood.

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
He's a bit of a creep.

40
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
He's a bit of a creep.

41
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
He's a bit of a creep.

42
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
He's a bit of a creep.

43
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
He's a bit of a creep.

44
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
He's a bit of a creep.

45
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
He's a bit of a creep.

46
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
He's a bit of a creep.

47
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
He's a bit of a creep.

48
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:27,520
He's a bit of a creep.

49
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:38,520
He's a bit of a creep.

50
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:51,940
Ladies!

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Thank you for coming.

52
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
You look delicious.

53
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,320
I mean beautiful.

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Please come in.

55
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Oh, Arlond, you are too kind.

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
How did I get myself into this?

57
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:22,520
Wow, I'm really anxious to see what happens in this dinner party.

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,040
Yeah, I guess we'll have to stay tuned and find out.

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
For part three.

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Yeah.

61
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,600
All right, well, we have some really great vocabulary, so I guess we can start with language

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,720
takeaway.

63
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Language takeaway.

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,760
All right, on language takeaway today, we have three great words.

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,400
Erika, why don't you start us off with the first one?

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
The first word is thoughtful.

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Thoughtful.

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Thoughtful.

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Thoughtful.

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,880
So, when you're thoughtful, you're kind, right?

71
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,640
You're kind, you're considerate to other people.

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,880
You think about what the other person would like.

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Right.

74
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
And you do that thing.

75
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
It's so thoughtful of you.

76
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Yeah.

77
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,360
Our second phrase, give me the creeps.

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
Give me the creeps.

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,040
Give me the creeps.

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,600
This is kind of a funny phrase, but I think if we listen to some examples, we'll understand

81
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,760
the meaning.

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,400
Example one.

83
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Horror movies give me the creeps.

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Example two.

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Stop it.

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
You're giving me the creeps.

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,840
Example three.

88
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
I saw this really scary clown.

89
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,960
It gave me the creeps.

90
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,960
So I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable.

91
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Right.

92
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,120
It makes me feel like scared.

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Yeah, scared.

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Also, gives me the creeps.

95
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,400
And our last phrase for language takeaway, rope me into.

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Rope me into something.

97
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,460
Rope me into something.

98
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,840
So if you rope me into something, it's...

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,160
It's like you convince me to do something that I don't really want to do.

100
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Right.

101
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,200
So I roped you into lending me your car.

102
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes.

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
It was a bad idea.

104
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
That was a bad idea.

105
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,800
And you roped me into going out for beers after work.

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,920
Yeah, that was a great idea.

107
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,760
All right, so rope me into, convince.

108
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Yeah.

109
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
All righty.

110
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
So I guess we could listen to our dialogue again.

111
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,640
This time a little bit slower and you'll be able to understand the language a little bit

112
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,120
more clearly.

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:44,280
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,520
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

115
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,320
Don't you think so, Ellen?

116
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh, yes, of course.

117
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,320
We'd love to come over.

118
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,920
Can I bring anything?

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,640
No, don't worry about it.

120
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,960
I'll take care of everything.

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,920
I'll see you tonight.

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,480
Come with an appetite.

123
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,080
I know I will.

124
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,040
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

125
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,160
He gives me the creeps.

126
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,240
Why on earth did you accept?

127
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,040
Oh, come on, Ellen.

128
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,200
It would be nice to get to know him.

129
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,160
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood and it would be rude to decline his invitation.

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,320
I guess so.

131
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,280
You always rope me into things like this.

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Ladies, thank you for coming.

133
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
You look delicious.

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
I mean, beautiful.

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Please come in.

136
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Come in.

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,280
Oh, Armand, you are too kind.

138
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,200
How did I get myself into this?

139
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Well, I guess that's a lot more clear and with that, we can start putting it together

140
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,920
today.

141
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,480
Putting it together.

142
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,280
Today we've got three words and phrases that we want to show you how you can put together

143
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,320
and use differently.

144
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,600
The first one is appetite.

145
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Appetite.

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Appetite.

147
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Appetite.

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Appetite.

149
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,440
So, appetite is like a strong desire for food, right?

150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Right.

151
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
An appetite.

152
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,920
We've got some examples that show you how to use this phrase.

153
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Let's listen.

154
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,000
Example one.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
Dinner smells so good.

156
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,000
It's giving me an appetite.

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Example two.

158
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
You're sure eating a lot.

159
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,120
You must have a big appetite.

160
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Example three.

161
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm getting sick.

162
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,920
I have a fever and I've lost my appetite.

163
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,240
Okay, so we saw some great examples of appetite.

164
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,680
You can lose your appetite.

165
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
That's right.

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
You have a big appetite.

167
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,560
A small appetite.

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,960
A healthy appetite.

169
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Right.

170
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,080
So, appetite just means... a desire for food.

171
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,640
A hunger for food.

172
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Okay.

173
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Great.

174
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
What's our second phrase for today?

175
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,200
Get to know someone.

176
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,320
Get to know.

177
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,040
Get to know.

178
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,760
So when you get to know someone is you talk to them and you find out what they do.

179
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Yeah.

180
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
You get more familiar with them.

181
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,880
More familiar, right?

182
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,920
For example, we can say, I got to know her in Spanish class and she's a really nice person.

183
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Yeah.

184
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Or you can say, Armand, Ellen, and Doris got to know each other at a dinner party.

185
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Right.

186
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,160
Or you can say, if you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not a bad guy.

187
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Yeah.

188
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
That's true.

189
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Okay.

190
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Get to know.

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,040
And our third phrase is, why on earth?

192
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,440
Why on earth?

193
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,160
Why on earth?

194
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Why on earth?

195
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,960
This is like a saying.

196
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Yeah.

197
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Expression.

198
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
You can use it in a lot of different ways.

199
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,600
So we've got some examples for you.

200
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,680
Let's listen.

201
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Example one.

202
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,760
Where on earth is my phone?

203
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,640
Example two.

204
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:26,480
How on earth did you learn English in one month?

205
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,200
Example three.

206
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,560
What on earth is it?

207
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,840
So when you ask a question with on earth, so why on earth, how on earth, what on earth,

208
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,480
it's like you're showing a lot of surprise.

209
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Okay.

210
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Great stuff.

211
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,120
So let's just listen to our dialogue a third time.

212
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,280
Oh, Armand, thank you for such a thoughtful invitation.

213
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,840
It's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner.

214
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Don't you think so, Ellen?

215
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Oh, yes, of course.

216
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
We'd love to come over.

217
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Can I bring anything?

218
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
No.

219
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,280
Don't worry about it.

220
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,960
I'll take care of everything.

221
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I'll see you tonight.

222
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Come with an appetite.

223
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
I know I will.

224
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner.

225
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
He gives me the creeps.

226
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Why on earth did you accept?

227
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Come on, Ellen.

228
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,840
It'll be nice to get to know him.

229
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,180
Besides, he's new to the neighborhood.

230
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,080
He'll be rude to decline his invitation.

231
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I guess so.

232
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:44,000
You always wrote me into things like this.

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:56,280
Ladies.

234
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,400
Thank you for coming.

235
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
You look delicious.

236
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I mean, beautiful.

237
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Please come in.

238
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh, Arlond, you are too kind.

239
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:23,320
How did I get myself into this?

240
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,120
We want to know what you think happens next.

241
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,360
Yes, what happens in this dialogue next.

242
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,520
So we want you to send us your idea of what happens next and we're going to choose the

243
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
best one.

244
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
That's right.

245
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,980
Marco and I will choose the best continuation of the story and we'll use that in part three

246
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,680
of The New Guy in Town.

247
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
That's right.

248
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
So you can give it any direction you want.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
That's right.

250
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,400
And of course, we'll publish the name of the author with the lesson.

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Yes.

252
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm really anxious to see what ideas come up and how we can end this dialogue.

253
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
I know.

254
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,760
We've got a lot of really creative users out there.

255
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,120
So I'm really looking forward to this.

256
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
That's right.

257
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
That's right.

258
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,360
So be sure to send us your ideas, either a private message or you can post it on the

259
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
comment section of this lesson.

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,440
And any other questions or doubts, go to EnglishPod.com and you can leave them there.

261
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Yes.

262
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Marco and I are always happy to answer your questions.

263
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,320
Okay, folks.

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:29,800
So until then, it's goodbye.
