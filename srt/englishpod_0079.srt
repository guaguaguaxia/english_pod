00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we have a special lesson for all our sci-fi or science fiction fans.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, and actually one special user was the inspiration for this lesson.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wolfgang.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This one is for you.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, sci-fi is very popular, Star Trek, Star Wars.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yep.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And well, there are some really interesting words that maybe you wouldn't use in real life or in normal circumstances.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But you do want to understand these movies or why they say these words, right?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we're going to look at some sci-fi language in this lesson.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But before we start, let's look at Vocabulary Preview.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Vocabulary Preview.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And in Vocabulary Preview today, we have one phrase only.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's right.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Unidentified spacecraft.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Unidentified spacecraft.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Unidentified spacecraft.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So unidentified.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You don't know which one it is.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You don't know the name.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You don't know the identity.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And a spacecraft.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A spacecraft is a vehicle that travels in space.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Also known as a spaceship.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Actually, this is interesting because you know the word UFO.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That comes from...

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Unidentified flying object.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Exactly.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So unidentified spacecraft, an unknown vehicle flying in space.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A UFO.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Have you ever seen a UFO?

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's too bad.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Have you?

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Of course.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hasn't anyone?

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All right.

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I think the people in our dialogue may or may not have seen a UFO.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So why don't we take a listen?

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They are breaking through.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Set your blasters to full power.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Good job.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Search the ship.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Bring her to me.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lord Hater, we have a survivor here.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where is she?

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't make me destroy you.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tell me where she is.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Not so fast.

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
She will no longer be your prisoner.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We will stop you.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Lord Hater, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
After them.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We lost them, sir.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, so a really cool Lord Hater, huh?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The music and everything.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, you may have noticed that it's similar to a certain movie out there.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, it seems quite original to me.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But everything for educational purposes.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's right.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, so we saw some words that were maybe a little bit difficult.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So let's take a look at these now in Language Takeaway.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Language Takeaway.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, I guess in the dialogue, the bad guys were breaking through.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Breaking through.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Breaking through.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In the simple present, it would be?

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
To break through.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, break through.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And what does that mean?

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us find out.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Example 1.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
After 15 minutes, the workers broke through the wall and rescued everyone from the fire.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Example 2.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He is such a good player.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He broke through the entire defense.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Example 3.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They are breaking through our impenetrable wall.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Run!

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right, so it's kind of like to enter by force somewhere.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, to maybe break some glass and come into a room or something like that.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Break through.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right, so Lord Hater had a fight with his enemy and he said he wants to settle this.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
To settle this.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Settle.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So what do you do when you settle something?

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, when you settle something is you end a fight or a dispute.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or an argument.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or an argument or a problem.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, when you settle an argument, does everyone always agree?

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, not always, right?

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sometimes you are forced to agree.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Not everyone agrees, but you have no other choice.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's a little bit different from reaching an agreement because there's usually a winner and a loser.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Right, exactly.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, now another very popular word and within sci-fi is this word tractor beam.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tractor beam.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A tractor beam.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tractor beam.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, I'm not sure if this really exists in real life.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, I've never heard of it.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But a tractor beam in sci-fi movies is like this invisible force that grabs an object and doesn't let it escape and brings it towards another spaceship.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So it's like almost like a rope that you can't see.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Right, and it brings it in.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So the spaceship managed to escape their tractor beam.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, I think that is definitely not true.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, maybe, I don't know.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But in sci-fi you will always hear this tractor beam.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, let's move on to our final word.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The spaceship was accelerating towards the speed of light.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Accelerating.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Accelerating.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To accelerate.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So that means to increase speed, right?

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, to go faster.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To go faster.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So if you are in your car.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You want to accelerate so you can pass another car.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Or even when you stop at a red light and it turns green.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You got to accelerate.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, to accelerate.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and take a look at some of the phrases that came up in this dialogue.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Lord Hater, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
After them.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We lost them, sir.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, great.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, great.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think that's a little bit more clear this time.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But like Marco said, I want to look at now some phrases that you might hear in a sci-fi context.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The first phrase that we can take a look at and maybe it looks a little bit strange.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He said she will no longer be your prisoner.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No longer be.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No longer be.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So what does he mean by no longer?

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Anymore.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Anymore, right?

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, so you will not be my prisoner anymore.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, so how would I use it in this form?

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No longer be.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've always got to use it in the future tense.

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, so she'll no longer be your prisoner.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will no longer be your employee.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, or I can say I will no longer be your boyfriend.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, so it's always will no longer be.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's always in the future.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
One more thing, Marco.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is this quite commonly used or maybe a little bit formal?

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I think it's a little bit formal and it's very, I don't know, to a certain point poetic.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, which I think is why we hear it a little bit more often in sci-fi movies.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All right, so no longer be.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What about our next phrase?

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, you know nothing of.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You know nothing of.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So again, it's very poetic.

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, basically meaning you don't know about.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You don't know about.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So again, let's take a look at how you would use it.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You know nothing of and then.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Science fiction.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You know nothing of science fiction.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Very good.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So you would use a noun afterwards.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Exactly.

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, so interesting phrases.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Again, formal and probably quite often used in science fiction movies.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But now you can understand when they use some of these words that maybe are a little bit difficult and very common in these types of movies.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now let's go to our last phrase.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And this one actually can be used in many different circumstances.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's settle this once and for all.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay, so we saw the word settle already.

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Now let's settle this once and for all.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Once and for all.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So what does that mean?

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Finally.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's right, forever.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay, so once and for all, forever.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use this phrase once and for all in different contexts.

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Example one.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm fed up with arguing about this.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's just settle the argument once and for all.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Example two.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He claims his photographs prove once and for all that UFOs do exist.

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Example three.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I told him once and for all that I don't want to be his girlfriend anymore.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, so now I think it's clear.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We've seen a lot of words.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We've seen a lot of phrases.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one more time.

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They are breaking through.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Set your blasters to full power.

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Excellent job.

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Search the ship.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Bring her to me.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Lord Hager, we have a survivor here.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Where is she?

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't make me destroy you.

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Tell me where she is.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Not so fast.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She will no longer be your prisoner.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sure you and I settled this once and for all.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We will stop you.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Lord Hager, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
After them.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We lost them, sir.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, so are you a big sci-fi fan?

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I think as you can tell, no.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Actually, I've seen some of the Star Wars movies, but everyone that I've watched, I've fallen asleep in the middle of.

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Really?

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, even in the movie theater.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I fell asleep in the movie theater watching Star Wars.

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wow, was it too boring?

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was too boring.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're not really into the fantasy side?

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, the whole time I'm sitting there going, this cannot happen.

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, that's why it's called science fiction, right?

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But it is interesting to some people, and well, behind Star Wars, there is a huge culture.

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Even some people know some of the languages or symbols that are used in it, or the names of some of the robots and models of spacecraft.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, maybe we'll have to come up with Star Wars pods.

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Exactly.

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, that's all for today, guys.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
