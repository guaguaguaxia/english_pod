00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,560
And my name is Catherine and today we have a great elementary level lesson all about

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,000
having fun.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,640
Today we are going to have a lot of fun and well before we explain what exactly we're

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,320
going to do, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,600
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,480
Okay, so the word we're previewing today is a noun.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
It's a thing.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,120
It's a roller coaster.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,660
Alright a roller coaster.

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,120
So that's what we're going to do today.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,240
We're going to get on a roller coaster.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,320
But what is a roller coaster?

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,280
Well a roller coaster is something that we see often times in parks, amusement parks.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,220
And it's like a little train but it can go upside down and it goes very fast and it turns

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,400
and it's supposed to make you scared and happy.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Okay.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,600
So it goes very fast and yeah many people have probably seen it.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,280
It goes very fast and as you say up and down and well you just get on it because it's fun.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,920
You go fast and you get scared because you're going so fast and sometimes you're going upside

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
down.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Exactly and for some reason, I don't know why, but in many romance languages the name

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
is Russian mountains.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Exactly, yeah.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
It's also in Spanish it's also a Russian mountain.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Yeah.

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
MontaÃ±a rusa.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
So I think the reason is because back in the day, back you know a hundred years ago when

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,920
they were starting, the first roller coasters came from Russia.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Oh wow.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Yeah.

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
So that's why it's called like that.

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Well that's a theory.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,600
I'm not sure but take a listen to today's dialogue.

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,480
We'll hear it one time and when we come back we'll be talking about more interesting and

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,600
exciting phrases and words about roller coasters.

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm so excited!

40
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
We're finally here!

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Six Flags Magic Mountain.

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,240
This is the best amusement park in the world.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,960
All right settle down now.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,480
You're going to give yourself a heart attack.

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,640
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.

46
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,840
Seems like such a rip-off don't you think?

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
It's not like I'm going to get on these things.

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
Whoa Viper!

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,600
That's the world's highest and fastest roller coaster!

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,400
You go at more than 100 miles per hour.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,280
I want to go on that one.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Can I mom please?

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Can I?

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
Chris I'm not sure you should get on that.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,160
It seems a bit too much for you and we just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
I don't think it's a good idea.

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Oh come on mom.

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
I can handle it.

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,640
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,320
Besides it's not like I'm going to throw up or anything.

61
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Let him go Carol.

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
He'll be fine.

63
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
All right!

64
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah this is amazing!

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:03:01,360
See how high up we're going?

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
All right we're back.

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,000
So uh interesting that I think this is very common.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,640
You get on one of these things, you go so fast that you just throw up.

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,160
Have you ever thrown up?

70
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
On a roller coaster?

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
No never.

72
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
No me neither.

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,000
All right well maybe it's not that common but let's take a look at some of the words

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,080
that we hear in this conversation between a boy and his parents.

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,840
All right so as we mentioned this word throw up, to throw up.

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,800
Why don't we take a look at that one first although it's almost at the end of the dialogue.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,440
What is it to throw up?

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
Okay well to throw is different than to throw up.

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
So remember that these two words go together to mean to vomit.

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,600
That means that the things in your stomach come out your mouth.

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,480
So like we heard in the dialogue they came in like bleh.

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,400
Yeah it's a very disgusting sound right?

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
And so sometimes people throw up when they eat too much, sometimes they throw up when

84
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
they're sick, and sometimes they throw up after riding a roller coaster.

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,120
And so this is an important phrase to know.

86
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Or like when you're on a boat you get seasick and you throw up.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,920
Or in a car sometimes you get carsick.

88
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,440
All right so as we mentioned we're also visiting an amusement park.

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,680
So why don't we explain this word a little bit, amusement park.

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
Okay first of all everyone probably knows the word park.

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,520
You know it's a public place.

92
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,480
But in this case an amusement park is a park of fun.

93
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,640
Amusement means fun.

94
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,160
And so it's usually a place that you go to and you pay a price and they give you a ticket

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,520
and you can play all day long.

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,680
So they have roller coasters and food and shows.

97
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
And probably the most famous or well known amusement park is Disneyland.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,160
So that's an amusement park.

99
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Exactly and there's lots of fun things to do for people of all ages.

100
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
All right and now the kid was so excited that the mom said all right you're gonna give yourself

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,680
a heart attack.

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,080
Okay well a heart attack is another serious health issue.

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,440
We talked about throwing up before.

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,240
Is when your heart stops beating.

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,680
So maybe something is stuck or there's some problem with your heart and there's no more

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,460
blood going through your heart.

107
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,640
And so it's a very very serious issue.

108
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,400
But in this case she's saying you're so excited you might hurt your heart.

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,160
You're gonna have a heart attack.

110
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,120
You might hurt yourself because you're so excited.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Right so she's exaggerating.

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,080
That's not really going to happen but she's trying to warn him.

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,120
All right and now the father mentioned that they paid $35 for each of their tickets and

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,560
he thought it was a ripoff.

115
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,280
Okay ripoff is a great great phrase that we use in spoken English to describe something

116
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,360
that's unfair.

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,760
So a price that's unfair.

118
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,280
Okay so you can maybe go to the market right and you ask how much a sweater is and they'll

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,980
tell you it's $100.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
You think that's a ripoff.

121
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
What a ripoff!

122
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,240
I can buy a sweater for $20.

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
So a hundred is definitely a ripoff.

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
All right so that's a ripoff.

125
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,000
It was a ripoff.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,520
He's not very happy with how much money he paid.

127
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Not at all.

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,320
All right and now the kid was talking about the roller coaster that is the highest and

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,480
fastest roller coaster and he said that the speed was at more than a hundred miles per

130
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
hour.

131
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
So what about this miles per hour?

132
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Okay this is very important if you go to America you'll see that the speeds on the road are

133
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,480
all in miles per hour.

134
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,520
So mile is a distance.

135
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,080
And per hour means how many miles you can travel every hour.

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,360
So in one hour you can go a hundred miles.

137
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
So we have the equivalent right?

138
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,000
We have like kilometers per hour.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,760
Exactly and so miles per hour, kilometers per hour, these are both called speeds.

140
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,600
And well this is called the imperial system right?

141
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,880
You use miles, you use inches and feet whereas the kilometers or centimeters or meters you

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,240
would use the metric system right?

143
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,360
Exactly because the counting is done by meters.

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Meters metric.

145
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,120
So in this case we're in America we know that because the speed limit is a hundred miles

146
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
or the speed here is a hundred miles an hour.

147
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,200
We know that we're in America because the speed the boy is talking about is miles per

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
hour.

149
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,040
Very good and I think yeah use it in North America and that's pretty much it right?

150
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
I think they use miles in Britain.

151
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Really?

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm positive I'd have to check with my British friends.

153
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,080
Alright okay so that's all the words we have for language takeaway.

154
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,640
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to explain some phrases.

155
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm so excited!

156
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
We're finally here!

157
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,400
Six Flags Magic Mountain.

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,560
This is the best amusement park in the world!

159
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
Alright settle down now.

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

161
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,600
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.

162
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,120
It seems like such a ripoff don't you think?

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
It's not like I'm gonna get on these things.

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,840
Whoa Viper that's the world's highest and fastest roller coaster!

165
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,720
You go at more than 100 miles per hour.

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
I want to go on that one.

167
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Can I mom please?

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Can I?

169
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Chris I'm not sure you should get on that.

170
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,400
It seems a bit too much for you and we've just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.

171
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,920
I don't think it's a good idea.

172
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Come on mom.

173
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,040
I can handle it.

174
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,320
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

175
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,600
Besides it's not like I'm gonna throw up or anything.

176
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Let him go Carol.

177
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
He'll be fine.

178
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Alright!

179
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Yeah!

180
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
This is amazing!

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
See how high up we're going?

182
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Whoa!

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:39,760
Alright we're back so now why don't we start with three phrases that we have prepared for

184
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
you today in Fluency Builder.

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Fluency Builder.

186
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay this first phrase Marco is definitely a parent phrase.

187
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,560
Okay so this is something that you often hear parents saying to their children.

188
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,160
They say settle down now.

189
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Settle down now.

190
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Teachers say this too.

191
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Yeah.

192
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Alright everyone settle down.

193
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,320
That means if I'm really excited and I want to talk and I'm running around the room and

194
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,160
my teacher says settle down now that means quiet down, go slowly, sit down, don't talk.

195
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,120
It means calm down.

196
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
Calm down yeah.

197
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,840
So to calm down to relax.

198
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Exactly.

199
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Settle down.

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,560
Alright and now the next phrase is a very kids phrase I think right?

201
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
That you would use on your parents.

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,480
So if they say no you can't go to your friend's house.

203
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,120
Oh come on please.

204
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh mom come on.

205
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,200
Alright so what do you mean with that phrase?

206
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,760
Come on come on what?

207
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,960
So in this we have a child who's asking something.

208
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,440
He's saying can you please let me do something.

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
Please come on.

210
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,240
That means I'm encouraging you to change your mind or to let me do something.

211
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,880
So please let me have my way.

212
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Right right.

213
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,760
Alright so come on and you don't only use it as a child or with your parents right?

214
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,200
You can encourage your friends to like come on come with me to the bar.

215
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Come on.

216
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Come on let's go.

217
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Please.

218
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Come on.

219
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Alright.

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Very good.

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
You know you want to.

222
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,920
And our last phrase I can handle it.

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,520
Okay this is next to the phrase oh come on.

224
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,400
So the boy is trying to explain that he's big enough and old enough to go on a roller

225
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
coaster but his mother doesn't know.

226
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
She says oh I don't know.

227
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
You know you're too young.

228
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,920
And so he says I can handle it.

229
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,440
That means I am big enough and old enough to go on a roller coaster.

230
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,040
I won't have a problem.

231
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,200
So you can do it right.

232
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,540
Basically I am good enough to do it.

233
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,720
So for example if I give you a very hard project you can say I can handle it.

234
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
I can do it.

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
You could also say I am very busy right now.

236
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,120
I can't handle it.

237
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Okay.

238
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
I can't.

239
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
I can't do it.

240
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
I can't do it.

242
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Alright.

243
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Very good.

244
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Interesting phrases there.

245
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,680
They're very useful and very very common in spoken English in North America and well

246
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,960
a lot of places.

247
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:16,200
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the third time and we'll be back.

248
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm so excited.

249
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
We're finally here.

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Six Flags Magic Mountain.

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
This is the best amusement park in the world.

252
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
All right.

253
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Settle down now.

254
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
You're going to give yourself a heart attack.

255
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I can't believe I'm here.

256
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm so excited.

257
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm so excited.

258
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm so excited.

259
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm so excited.

260
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm so excited.

261
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.

262
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,680
Seems like such a ripoff, don't you think?

263
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
It's not like I'm going to get on these things.

264
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Whoa.

265
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Viper.

266
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,440
That's the world's highest and fastest roller coaster.

267
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,520
You go at more than 100 miles per hour.

268
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,960
I want to go on that one.

269
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Can I, mom, please?

270
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Can I?

271
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,040
Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that.

272
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,960
It seems a bit too much for you and we just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.

273
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I don't think it's a good idea.

274
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Come on, mom.

275
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I can handle it.

276
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,600
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

277
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,160
Besides, it's not like I'm going to throw up or anything.

278
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Let him go, Kel.

279
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
He'll be fine.

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
All right.

281
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Yeah, this is amazing.

282
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
See how high up we're going?

283
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Whoa.

284
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
All right.

285
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:24,160
So this amusement park, Magic Mountain, it actually is a little bit bigger than I thought.

286
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,960
All right, so this amusement park, Magic Mountain, it actually exists in the United States, right?

287
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
It does.

288
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,720
And Six Flags is really a brand, so there are many different amusement parks called

289
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,240
Six Flags and each one has a different name.

290
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,120
I'm not sure where Magic Mountain is, but-

291
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
That one's in California.

292
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah.

293
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,440
Then you have Six Flags Greater America or something like that.

294
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah, that's my Chicago Six Flags.

295
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
That's the one in Chicago?

296
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Yeah.

297
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,320
So they're basically amusement parks and they're famous because they have really great or intense

298
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,560
roller coasters, right?

299
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Exactly.

300
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,720
So the one that we heard about in today's dialogue is called Viper, like the snake,

301
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,160
and that one is at the amusement park in California you mentioned.

302
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,720
But the famous ride in Chicago is Batman the Ride.

303
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Oh, really?

304
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
Because you sit on a seat, but there's no place for your feet, so your feet swing in

305
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,840
the wind.

306
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,760
And it's very fast and you don't actually sit on a train, right?

307
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,560
The track is on top of your head.

308
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Exactly.

309
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
And you're hanging like a bat.

310
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
So you see everyone downstairs.

311
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Yeah.

312
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,440
Well, not downstairs, down at the bottom.

313
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,000
And I hear they have a very serious problem with people losing their shoes.

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I heard about this.

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, so-

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,360
People wearing sandals and they just fly off.

317
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Exactly.

318
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,440
So I want to warn everyone, if you go to Chicago or you go to these upside down, these flipped

319
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,840
roller coasters, you should bring real shoes, not sandals.

320
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
All right.

321
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,800
Well, as we mentioned, in many languages, in the Romance languages, they're called Russian

322
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Mountains.

323
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,720
I wonder, for our Russian listeners, do you have any intense or great roller coasters

324
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
in Russia?

325
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,080
I mean, if they come from Russia, they should have amazing roller coasters there, right?

326
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
That's right.

327
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,600
Or do you have any idea why we call them Russian Mountains in other languages?

328
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Please let us know.

329
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,520
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

332
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Bye.

333
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:25,040
Let's get back to business.
