00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to another episode of EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,140
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,200
And today, with Erica, we are getting married.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,360
Well, we're not getting married.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,520
We're not, but our actors in the podcast are.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
That's right.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,400
So we've got a lesson today about weddings.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
And you know what?

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,040
A lot of the language in this lesson is about weddings and marriages.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,360
And maybe you don't need to use this language every day, but learning this vocabulary will

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,240
definitely help you understand or learn a lot more about Anglo culture.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,960
Okay, great point, Marco.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,440
I think now we can look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,040
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,360
So two simple words in this vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,920
The first one is groom.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,360
Groom.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,680
Groom.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,760
Groom.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,880
So who is the groom?

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,920
Is the man, the man that's getting married.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Okay.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,880
And our second word is...

25
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Bride.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Bride.

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Bride.

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,780
And obviously, the bride is...

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,080
The woman getting married.

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Perfect.

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,720
Now we have our bride and our groom, so it's time to listen to our dialogue the first time.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:31,760
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,320
Yeah, well, it's about time.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,920
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,680
Don't be mean.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,960
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Their dresses look beautiful.

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,560
That's the flower girl and the ring bearer.

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,760
Oh, they look so cute.

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm starving.

44
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,920
I hope the food's good at the reception.

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,480
That's all you ever think about, food.

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,040
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
She looks gorgeous.

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Wait, what's she doing?

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Where is she going?

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh, great.

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

52
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh, Marco, that's so sad.

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Yeah.

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,440
I know, the reception is canceled now.

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,040
Marco, they're not getting married.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Oh, well, I mean, the best part is when you go and eat and drink at the reception.

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Okay.

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Well, there's some great language in this dialogue.

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,160
And now, let's look at our language takeaway.

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,520
Language takeaway.

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
Great.

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,560
Our first word on the language takeaway today is, it's about time.

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,900
It's about time.

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,140
It's about time.

65
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,560
It's about time.

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,240
So now, we are going to listen to some examples on how we use this great phrase.

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,960
Example one.

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,040
Dinner's ready.

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
It's about time.

70
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,480
I'm starving.

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
Example two.

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Guess what?

73
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
I finally got a job.

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,880
It's about time.

75
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,600
You've been unemployed for two years.

76
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,360
Example three.

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
We're almost there.

78
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Just a couple more minutes.

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
It's about time.

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,740
We've been driving for 12 hours.

81
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,600
So this phrase means, finally.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Finally, at last.

83
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,920
We've been waiting a long time for this.

84
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Exactly.

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Okay.

86
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
So, it's about time.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Great.

88
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,440
Let's take a look at our second word now.

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Aisle.

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Aisle.

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
A-I-S-L-E.

92
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Aisle.

93
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Aisle.

94
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,640
It's a tricky word.

95
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,520
It sounds like the contraction of I will.

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah, but it's spelled so strangely.

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Right.

98
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,640
You don't pronounce the S. The S is silent.

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
That's true.

100
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
It's aisle.

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,200
So what is an aisle?

102
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,800
In a big room where you have a lot of chairs, that space in the middle that allows people

103
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,420
to walk through, that's the aisle.

104
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,720
So the aisle is the part where you walk.

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Yes.

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
In a big room.

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
In a big room.

108
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
With many chairs.

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
With many chairs.

110
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay.

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
So, in the church, the bride and groom walked on the aisle.

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Exactly.

113
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Great.

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Let's move to our third word.

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
This is a very tricky one.

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Okay.

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
This is a very tricky one.

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Okay.

119
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
So, who are the bridesmaids?

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Bridesmaid.

121
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Bridesmaid.

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Bridesmaids.

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
So, who are the bridesmaids?

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Or wait, maybe you should ask me that.

125
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah, because we don't get bridesmaids.

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Okay.

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,680
So, the bridesmaids are the women who are friends of the bride who stand next to her

128
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
when she's getting married.

129
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,960
Usually, they're her best friends.

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Right.

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Okay.

132
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Okay.

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
So, we have our bridesmaids.

134
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Now, we have our flower girl.

135
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,860
Flower girl.

136
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Flower girl.

137
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,000
Again, I'll explain this one.

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please, please.

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,920
The flower girl is that cute little girl who walks down the aisle and who throws flowers.

140
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
That's the flower girl.

141
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,920
And, with the flower girl, we have our ring bearer.

142
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,040
Ring bearer.

143
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Ring bearer.

144
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,920
So, the ring bearer is the cute little boy who walks down the aisle carrying the...

145
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Rings.

146
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Yep.

147
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Okay.

148
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,840
So, a lot of useful vocabulary for a wedding ceremony.

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
That's true.

150
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,960
Now, let's look at our last word.

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Gorgeous.

152
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Gorgeous.

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Gorgeous.

154
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,320
Gorgeous means beautiful.

155
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Very beautiful.

156
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Yeah.

157
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, beautiful, you can only use with a woman.

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can you use gorgeous with a woman or with a man?

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Gorgeous is unisex.

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,240
So, both men and women are gorgeous.

162
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Right.

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,600
So, that girl is gorgeous.

164
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,120
That guy is gorgeous.

165
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Right.

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
Or you can say even this house is gorgeous.

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Okay.

168
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,640
So, men, women, objects.

169
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Yes, yes.

170
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
All right.

171
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,320
Well, we've learned some really interesting vocabulary that will help us to understand

172
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,640
an Anglo wedding.

173
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:29,480
So, why don't we listen to the dialogue slowed down?

174
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,240
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

175
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah.

176
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,440
Well, it's about time.

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,640
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

178
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,320
Don't be mean.

179
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,620
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

180
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,520
Their dresses look beautiful.

181
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,960
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,520
That's the flower girl and the ring bearer.

183
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew.

184
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,560
Oh, they look so cute.

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm starving.

187
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,520
I hope the food's good at the reception.

188
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,320
That's all you ever think about, food.

189
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,840
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

190
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
She looks gorgeous.

191
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait, what's she doing?

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
Where's she going?

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,720
Oh, great.

194
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,680
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

195
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,960
Now in this dialogue, we have a word that many students often make mistakes on.

196
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,280
So this is a word that causes a lot of problems.

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,800
Yes, the word marry.

198
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Marry.

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,440
Marry, right?

200
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:55,440
So we are going to listen now to some common mistakes on how English learners use this

201
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
word.

202
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,800
Right, so these are wrong examples.

203
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,440
Example one.

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,600
Honey, let's marry.

205
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Example two.

206
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,040
We married four years ago.

207
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,440
Example three.

208
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,500
When I marry, I want a huge wedding.

209
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,840
These are great examples of mistakes students make with the word marry.

210
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,240
They're missing a word.

211
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,480
Let's listen to these right examples to see what word is missing.

212
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,680
Example one.

213
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,720
Honey, let's get married.

214
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,220
Example two.

215
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,560
We got married four years ago.

216
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,360
Example three.

217
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,240
When I get married, I want a huge wedding.

218
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:05,360
Great, so we can see that when we use the word marry, we say to get married.

219
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Exactly right.

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Get married.

221
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
To get married, right?

222
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,840
Okay, don't forget that.

223
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Yes.

224
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Get married.

225
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I will get married.

226
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,360
We got married.

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Right.

228
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
So now you know exactly how to use this word.

229
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,820
We are ready to listen to our dialogue again for a third time and this time it's going

230
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,160
to be at a normal speed.

231
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,520
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

232
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,120
Yeah, well, it's about time.

233
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,720
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

234
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
Don't be mean.

235
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,780
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

236
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Their dresses look beautiful.

237
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,440
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

238
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,360
That's the flower girl and the rain bearer.

239
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew.

240
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,160
Oh, they look so cute.

241
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,480
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

242
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I'm starving.

243
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,760
I hope the food's good at the reception.

244
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,280
That's all you ever think about, food.

245
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,840
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

246
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
She looks gorgeous.

247
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Wait, what's she doing?

248
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Where is she going?

249
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
So great.

250
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

251
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:17,720
Okay, well, I'm going to be honest with you.

252
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,480
I don't know too much about marriages because, first of all, I'm not married and I've never

253
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,160
really been to many marriages.

254
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
So, Erica, some questions for you.

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Okay.

256
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
What are these bridesmaids do?

257
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,400
I mean, what are they about?

258
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
What do the bridesmaids do?

259
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,160
Yeah, what are they doing there?

260
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,480
Well, like I said earlier, the bridesmaids are the friends of the bride.

261
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,360
But the most important people, besides the bride and groom, are the best man and the

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
maid of honor.

263
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Okay.

264
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
And what do they do there in the ceremony?

265
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Well, what they do is they sign the marriage license.

266
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Okay.

267
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,360
So they're like witnesses.

268
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Exactly.

269
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Okay.

270
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
So, but wait a minute.

271
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,040
They sign the marriage license there in the church?

272
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Yeah, of course.

273
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,360
Right inside the church, you sign the marriage license.

274
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Wow, that's strange because, from what I know, in other countries, usually you will sign

275
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,220
the marriage license before the ceremony.

276
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,880
So you get married twice?

277
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,560
Yeah, you have like the civil marriage and then you have like the church wedding or whatever.

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
That's so complicated.

279
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Well, yeah, I mean, the church wedding is just the ceremony.

280
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,040
It's not really anything official.

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,880
Oh, in Canada, it's the official part as well.

282
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,840
I guess maybe you're just more efficient.

283
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Maybe.

284
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Yeah.

285
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,560
Well, this is a really fascinating, a really interesting subject, isn't it?

286
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,160
Yeah, because there's so many countries that have different marriage ceremonies.

287
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,280
I know that marriages in India last around seven days.

288
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,920
I want to know more about how our users get married in their country.

290
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Yeah.

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,840

293
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
Yeah, it should be interesting, right?

294
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Okay.
