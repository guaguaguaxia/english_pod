00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,720
My name is Catherine and today we are here with an advanced level lesson.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,880
That means that we're going to listen to a pretty long and exciting dialogue and then

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,840
we'll talk a little bit about what you've heard and some of these cool interesting phrases.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
That's right.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,480
Today we have a lesson about planning a crime or planning a bank robbery.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Oh, my favorite.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,920
There have been lots of movies about this topic, very fun movies.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,440
From the beginning of movie making till now, it's a very popular topic.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,440
That's right.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,800
On this occasion, as Catherine said, it's a nice fun dialogue and we're going to have

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,400
a lot of colloquial terms.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,120
Maybe you won't really understand a couple of different phrases because they're very

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
colloquial.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
They're very American terms.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,520
The accents are also, they're a little bit from Boston, kind of like New Jersey maybe

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
or something.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Right.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,400
So, keep an ear out for some of the strange or unusual phrases.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,680
We will be talking about them in a moment.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,360
But don't worry, if you don't understand this dialogue the first time, you'll be hearing

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
it again later.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,440
All right.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,200
Let's run through this one more time from the top.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,720
I will be positioned here, across from the bank on this park bench.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,080
Now according to the intel we got from Jimmy.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Oh, who's Jimmy?

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,080
Geez, Ralph, pay attention, will ya?

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,760
Jimmy's our mole, you know?

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,600
The guy on the inside.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,480
He's been snooping and passing on the info to us so we can pull this heist off.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah, Ralph, clean the mothballs out of your ears and listen up.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,840
This here is important.

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,800
We don't want to end up back in the slammer, do ya?

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,360
Your role is pretty important here.

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,920
We're dependent on you, man.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,840
Okay, okay, I'm listening.

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Mothballs.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Alrighty then.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Where was I?

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Yeah, okay, so I'll be on the lookout, sitting here on the bench across from the bank.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,120
Nobody moves until I give the go-ahead, all right?

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,480
And what's the go-ahead, Ralph?

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,000
You uh, you uh, oh yeah, you'll take off your hat and scratch your head.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,480
When I take my hat off and scratch my head, you do what?

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
I get in the box.

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,920
Right, you get in the box.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll make sure it's all sealed and then posing as the delivery guy, I'll drop off a special

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
package for the manager.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,320
Now according to Jimmy, the bank manager's leaving early on Tuesday, because it's his

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,280
wedding anniversary.

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,720
He and the wife are having a romantic rendezvous in the country, so any packages delivered

55
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,240
will be left unopened in his office until he gets back late on Wednesday.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,120
Which gives us access to his office for at least 12 hours.

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Okay Ralph, this is where you come in.

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,440
Where are you?

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm standing right next to you, Sammy.

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Oh sorry, Sam.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,920
I'm in the box, right here in that box.

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,240
And what do you do once I deliver you to the manager's office?

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,680
I stay in the box until the bank is closed, and then I get out of the box.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
And then?

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
What next, Ralph?

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,960
Oh for Pete's sake, this is never going to work.

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,160
Hey, give me a chance here, fellas.

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I crack the safe and then, then I take the money, and then I, um, I get back in the box.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
Atta boy, Ralph.

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,120
In the morning, I come back to the bank, say there's been a mix-up with the delivery I

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,000
made, and take the special package back here.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,240
Alright, let's get some sleep.

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,200
It's a big day tomorrow, fellas.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,920
A perfect plan, Sammy!

75
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,280
It went off without a hitch!

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,680
Let's open this up and get Ralph out of here so we can start counting the money.

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,120
Phew, I sure am glad to see you guys.

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,720
I was sure getting lonely with no one to talk.

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
That's nice.

80
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Okay, how much?

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Uh, really?

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Really, really, really glad.

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Money, Ralph, money!

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Oh man, I knew I forgot something.

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Damn it.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Alright, we're back.

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:17,000
So, um, obviously this guy Ralph, I don't know why, always the one robber whose name

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,480
is Ralph is not very clever.

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,360
No, it doesn't mean that Ralphs are generally not smart people, but yeah, I think you're

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
right.

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
There's usually...

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Yeah, like in bank robberies or something, like for example in the old movies, always

93
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
Ralph was the one that was messing things up.

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Oh, Ralph.

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,880
Well, let's find out what Ralph screwed up today.

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,320
First of all, we've got the guys Sammy, Ralph, and Frankie who are talking about the plan.

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
And Sammy mentions that he had the intel from Jimmy.

98
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,920
Okay, so when we talk about intel, we're talking about information, right?

99
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
That's right.

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,880
So intel is a word that's short for intelligence or facts or information.

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
That's right.

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,680
So you can talk about intelligence as maybe you're very smart, you're very intelligent,

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,680
but when we talk about intelligence, we talk about gathering information in order to help

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
us accomplish an objective.

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,560
For example, in movies about the CIA, we often hear them talk about gathering intel.

106
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,280
That means collecting facts.

107
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Right.

108
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
Very good.

109
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,720
So they had intel from Jimmy about the bank and the layout.

110
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,880
And well, they were like, who's Jimmy?

111
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,920
And Sammy says that, well, he's our mole, you know, the guy on the inside.

112
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
A mole.

113
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,160
So mole is an animal.

114
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,600
But in cases of intelligence, or maybe in this case, a bank robbery, spying, a mole

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
is a person who's basically stealing information.

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,840
So for example, if I work in the CIA, but I'm selling information from the CIA to the

117
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
French government, I'm a mole.

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Right.

119
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,760
So you're basically like a spy.

120
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,880
Yes.

121
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
You're a person on the inside.

122
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,040
And that's what they mean when he says, he's our guy on the inside.

123
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,520
You're inside the enemy's territory or you're inside their organization.

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Exactly.

125
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,880
So for example, have you seen the show 24?

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Yeah, with Jack Bauer.

127
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, they often have this problem of moles inside the organization.

128
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,880
So maybe the terrorists have a guy on the inside.

129
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
That's right.

130
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
He's a mole.

131
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,480
So they have somebody that has penetrated their organization.

132
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Exactly.

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,520
Okay, so they talk about the mole and how they are going to pull this heist off.

134
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,240
Okay, so the phrase here is to pull off a heist.

135
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,720
First of all, what's a heist?

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Well, a heist is a robbery, is basically a robbery.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,840
Yeah, it's another word for robbery.

138
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
It's kind of old though.

139
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
You don't really say it anymore, right?

140
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,520
No, you can say it's a heist movie or it's a movie about a heist.

141
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
It's almost like a genre.

142
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Yeah.

143
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,840
So there's a basic storyline where they plan the robbery, they do the robbery, something

144
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,760
goes wrong, what's going to happen?

145
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,840
So that's a heist.

146
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Very good.

147
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,160
So a heist is something that was planned out, like a robbery that's planned out.

148
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
It's not really if you come up to someone and say, give me your wallet.

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
That's not really a heist.

150
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
No, that's a stick up.

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Right.

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,740
But a heist is something that you pull off.

153
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,720
So to pull off is to succeed.

154
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
To accomplish.

155
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
To accomplish.

156
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
So I pulled it off.

157
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I was able to do it.

158
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,680
So you pulled off the heist.

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Very good.

160
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,520
And well, they were talking about if they do it, they don't want to get caught because

161
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,200
they don't want to go back to the slammer.

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
The slammer.

163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Yeah, well, I don't blame them.

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,760
I wouldn't want to go to the slammer either.

165
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360
So what is the slammer?

166
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
The slammer.

167
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
The big house.

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Right.

169
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
Lock up, the slammer, the big house.

170
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,280
All these are colloquial synonyms for prison, for jail.

171
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Jail.

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,680
Normally we say prison or jail, like it's a maximum security prison, like prison break,

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
the TV show.

174
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Right.

175
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
But in colloquial English, we often say slammer.

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Okay.

177
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,520
The slammer or the big house.

178
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Okay.

179
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,320
So they were talking that they don't want to go back to the slammer.

180
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,120
And now when they were actually planning out the crime, he says, well, you wait until I

181
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
give you the go ahead.

182
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Okay.

183
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,800
So this is the plan.

184
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,920
He's going to wait for a sign.

185
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,520
The go ahead means a sign that indicates that it's time to do something.

186
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Okay.

187
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,280
So for example, so in this case, what is that sign?

188
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,600
The sign or the go ahead is he'll take off his hat and scratch his head.

189
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Okay.

190
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,200
So that's a sign that means it's okay to proceed.

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,360
It's okay to continue.

192
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,400
So you can also say, okay, when we're ready to go, Marco, I'll give you the go ahead.

193
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Okay.

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Just wait for me to wave.

195
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Okay.

196
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Very good.

197
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
That's a signal.

198
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Exactly.

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
All right.

200
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Very good.

201
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,640
Now moving on, we have a French word here, but that's used very commonly in English.

202
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,720
And they said, okay, we have a rendezvous.

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

204
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,720
So a rendezvous is a meetup or a time or place where people are connecting together.

205
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,920
So for example, in a heist, you could say we're going to rob the bank and then we will

206
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,480
rendezvous at our favorite restaurant in two hours.

207
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Okay.

208
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,720
So a rendezvous is to meet up, to get together.

209
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Right.

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,280
But in this case, they're talking about a romantic rendezvous.

211
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,640
So this means a trip with a lover.

212
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,960
So it's a little bit different, right?

213
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,960
He and his wife are having a romantic rendezvous in the country.

214
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Okay.

215
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,240
That means that they're going to have a romantic meeting.

216
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Okay.

217
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Very good.

218
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,920
And now this next phrase is very, very interesting.

219
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,960
It's very common to hear it as well.

220
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I think like moms say it a lot.

221
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,600
Oh, for Pete's sake.

222
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,920
Oh, for Pete's sake.

223
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,720
Well, I don't know who Pete is, honestly.

224
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,120
But this means my gosh or come on or I'm so tired of this.

225
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,960
So you're a little bit exasperated.

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Maybe you're a little bit irritated.

227
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,160
Oh, for Pete's sake, Marco.

228
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Stop giving me examples.

229
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm just, I'm done hearing them.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,680
So there are a lot of other ways to say this, right?

232
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Yeah.

233
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,000
So you could say for goodness sake.

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
For goodness sake or oh, for heaven's sake.

235
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
For heaven's sake.

236
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
And finally, for God's sake.

237
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Right.

238
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
But this one you have to be careful because some people who are religious might be offended

239
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
if you use it.

240
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,240
So if that's the case, then you would just rather go with Pete's sake, heaven's sake

241
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,200
or goodness sake.

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay.

243
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
For goodness sake.

244
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,320
It's a very common phrase and as you say, it's for when you're a little bit irritated.

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,880
It's like oh, for goodness sake.

246
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Stop complaining.

247
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Exactly.

248
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Right?

249
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Okay.

250
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,120
And now for our last word.

251
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
You may have seen the word fellas.

252
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Fellas.

253
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,200
So this comes from the word fellow, person, man.

254
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:03,880
But oftentimes in these kind of movies or stories about heists or crimes, the men talk

255
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,760
to each other using the word fella or fellas.

256
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,200
So come on, fellas.

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
Let's go.

258
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,680
That means come on, guys.

259
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Come on, everyone.

260
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Okay.

261
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Yeah.

262
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,400
So this is always about men, not like a group of women would use this.

263
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,480
And it's something that's a little bit older.

264
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,680
We don't really say this like oh, me and my fellas, we're going to go to the store.

265
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,200
You would say this more in old time English.

266
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Yeah.

267
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,360
You can see it maybe in some movies when somebody comes up and greets other people, other guys,

268
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
he would say hey, fellas.

269
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Exactly.

270
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Or there's a mafia movie.

271
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
It's about the American mafia called Goodfellas.

272
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Very good.

273
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,320
It's a very famous one.

274
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,160
So it kind of gives you that feeling of an older English like the 1940s to the 1970s.

275
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Okay.

276
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Very good.

277
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
So we've got a lot of things going on in this bank robbery.

278
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,960
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a little

279
00:11:51,960 --> 00:12:01,840
bit.

280
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,320
Alright let's run through this one more time from the top.

281
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,840
I will be positioned here across from the bank on this park bench.

282
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,160
Now according to the intel we got from Jimmy.

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,800
Oh, who's Jimmy?

284
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,240
Geez, Ralph, pay attention, will ya?

285
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
Jimmy's our mole, you know?

286
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,760
The guy on the inside.

287
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,640
He's been snooping and passing on the info to us so we can pull this heist off.

288
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,520
Yeah, Ralph, clean the mothballs out of your ears and listen up.

289
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,000
This here is important.

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,960
We don't want to end up back in the slammer, do ya?

291
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,520
Your role is pretty important here.

292
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
We're dependent on you, man.

293
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, okay, I'm listening.

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Mothballs.

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Alrighty then.

296
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Where was I?

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, okay.

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,640
So, I'll be on the lookout, sitting here on the bench across from the bank.

299
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,240
Nobody moves until I give the go-ahead, alright?

300
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,600
And what's the go-ahead, Ralph?

301
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,120
You uh, you uh, oh yeah, you'll take off your hat and scratch your head.

302
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Right.

303
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,640
When I take my hat off and scratch my head, you do what?

304
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,120
I get in the box.

305
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,040
Right, you get in the box.

306
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,800
I'll make sure it's all sealed and then posing as the delivery guy, I'll drop off a special

307
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,680
package for the manager.

308
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,440
Now, according to Jimmy, the bank manager's leaving early on Tuesday, because it's his

309
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,400
wedding anniversary.

310
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,840
He and the wife are having a romantic rendezvous in the country, so any packages delivered

311
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,400
will be left unopened in his office until he gets back late on Wednesday.

312
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,240
Which gives us access to his office for at least 12 hours.

313
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay Ralph, this is where you come in.

314
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Where are you?

315
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,240
I'm standing right next to you, Sammy.

316
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Oh, sorry Sam, I'm in the box, right here, in that box.

317
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,400
And what do you do once I deliver you to the manager's office?

318
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,840
I stay in the box until the bank is closed, and then I get out of the box.

319
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,360
And then?

320
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
What next, Ralph?

321
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,120
Oh, for Pete's sake, this is never going to work.

322
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Hey, give me a chance here, fellas.

323
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:12,000
I crack the safe and then, then I take the money, and then I, um, I get back in the box.

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,640
Atta boy, Ralph.

325
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,320
In the morning I come back to the bank, say there's been a mix-up with the delivery I

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,120
made and take the special package back here.

327
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,400
Alright, let's get some sleep.

328
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,360
It's a big day tomorrow, fellas.

329
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,080
A perfect plan, Sammy!

330
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,440
It went off without a hitch!

331
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,640
Let's open this up and get Ralph out of here so we can start counting the money.

332
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,280
Phew, I sure am glad to see you guys.

333
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,920
I was sure getting lonely with no one to talk.

334
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
That's nice.

335
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Okay, how much?

336
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Uh, really?

337
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,760
Really, really, really glad.

338
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,440
Money, Ralph, money!

339
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh, man, I knew I forgot something.

340
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Damn it.

341
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:05,880
Okay, so, someone proclaimed at the end of the dialogue that everything went off without

342
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
a hitch.

343
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Mm-hmm.

344
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Is this true?

345
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
No.

346
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,840
What does it mean if something went without a hitch?

347
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,040
It went off without a hitch means there was not even one problem.

348
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
It went off, it went perfectly.

349
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Smoothly.

350
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Smoothly, yes.

351
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Okay.

352
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,560
And it didn't because, well, these robbers didn't actually rob anyone.

353
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,040
Right, he forgot to get the money.

354
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,960
Right, so he's kind of an idiot.

355
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Right.

356
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,560
But there are actually a lot of good movies.

357
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,760
I think the most recent one about bank robberies is Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve, Ocean's

358
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Thirteen.

359
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Yeah, that's right.

360
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,320
Those are all about big heists.

361
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Big heists.

362
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,240
And I think they mentioned the word heist a couple of times in that movie.

363
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Yeah, definitely.

364
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,160
So, there was a movie with Clive Owen a few years ago called The Inside Man that was maybe

365
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,200
one of the best heist movies I've seen in a long time.

366
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Yeah, that was a really good movie.

367
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,360
I think also Swordfish was a pretty good movie with John Travolta.

368
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Yeah, I remember that one, too.

369
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,600
Yeah, I like it when the bad guys win, you know, because it's a little bit more interesting.

370
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,160
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

371
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,240
I don't think the public likes this.

372
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,080
Well, in The Inside Man, the bad guy is kind of a good guy, but he wins.

373
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,120
Yeah, I like that.

374
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,160
So, but it's a very interesting topic and I don't know, I haven't really heard of many

375
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
bank robberies nowadays anymore.

376
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Not so much.

377
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,940
I think security in banks is pretty good, but I'd be very curious to hear from our users

378
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,760
if they have any favorite heist stories or movies, real or fake.

379
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,860
Both are okay.

380
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,720
You can let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

381
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
That's right.

382
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Thanks for having us, everyone.

383
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Bye.

384
00:16:39,720 --> 00:17:08,380
See you soon.
