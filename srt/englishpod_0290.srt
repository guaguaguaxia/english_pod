00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,920
My name is Catherine and today we have a very romantic dialogue for you.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
That's right.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,800
Today we are at a shop and we are buying jewelry.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,360
So of course there are many different types of jewelry and stones.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,720
So we're going to take a look at all that great stuff.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's jump into our dialogue and see what's going on.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,200
Good afternoon sir.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Is there anything I can help you with today?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Yeah.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,880
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,240
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,180
Well I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,120
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,080
No, not really.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm completely at a loss.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,560
Well you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart shaped pendant.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,960
What is her favorite gemstone?

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
That purple one.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,800
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Don't worry.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,760
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure free shopping environment.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,260
That stone is an amethyst.

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,640
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,600
Take a look at this bracelet.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,900
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,200
It's a great statement piece.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
Oh wow.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
That's really pretty.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
Jess would love that.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,640
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,680
Perhaps a necklace?

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,160
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,320
You could also get her a timepiece.

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,240
It's both glamorous and functional.

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,680
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Jess?

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
Well, she's very smart.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,160
She has a great sense of humor.

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
She's very feminine.

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,400
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Well, actually I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
I've just been so nervous.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,160
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, I've decided.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm going to pop the question.

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,320
Fabulous.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,880
We should look at engagement rings then.

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,840
Now that's a whole other section.

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,800
All right.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
We're back.

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,920
In Language Takeaway, we have a lot of jewelry words and terms for you.

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
So let's take a look at some of these.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,080
The first one I want to talk about, Marco, is pearl earrings.

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
That's right.

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,360
The sales assistant offered a set of pearl earrings.

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,240
So we have earrings that you wear on your ears, right?

62
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Usually girls.

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Yes.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
But what about pearl?

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,320
Pearls are a kind of decoration that come from inside an animal.

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,160
The clam is a sea animal that opens up and inside there might be a little pearl.

67
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,600
It's usually a white or pink, very, very pretty object.

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,760
And we sometimes put them in earrings or on a necklace.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
That's right.

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,760
So a set of pearl earrings are earrings that have this little rock or this little marble

71
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,240
looking thing on it.

72
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,600
And well, he also offered a beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Okay.

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
A pendant is a kind of necklace.

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,840
And basically a pendant is something that hangs down.

76
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,080
So in this case, it's a necklace that might have something on the bottom that hangs down

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,220
like in the shape of a heart.

78
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,200
So that's what heart-shaped means.

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,160
It means that it has the shape of a heart.

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,800
Like for example, you can have a heart-shaped cake.

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,280
You can also have a heart-shaped face.

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Okay.

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Very good.

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,640
And of course the pendant is a little thing that hangs from the necklace.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,800
Now maybe some pendants can also have a gemstone and that's our next word.

86
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,400
So a gemstone is not just a normal stone.

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
It's a beautiful, normally expensive stone.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
And we often have gemstones that relate to a person's birthday.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
So these come in many different colors and types.

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,240
The two that we heard about in today's dialogue are purple and blue.

93
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
That's right.

94
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,120
The purple stone that you're talking about is the one that the shop assistant suggested,

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,640
which is amethyst.

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,880
Amethyst is a purple stone.

97
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,000
It's really, really pretty and it's sometimes light, sometimes a little bit darker.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
Depends on the one that you're looking at.

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,400
But amethyst is a little bit, it's a little bit difficult to say, but it's a kind of gemstone.

100
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,760
The other one we heard about is called topaz.

101
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Okay.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
A topaz.

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
And this one is blue.

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,960
So I guess they all look very much like diamonds, but they are different colors.

105
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,280
So topaz looks like a blue diamond kind of.

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Right.

107
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
And ruby is red.

108
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,600
And ruby is red.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Very good.

110
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I think there's a black one that's called onyx.

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Onyx is black.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
That's right.

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Okay.

114
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
So many different types of gemstones.

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,120
And as Catherine said, usually each month has a specific gemstone.

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
So that's considered your gemstone if you were born on that month.

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Exactly.

118
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
All right.

119
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,440
Moving on to our next word, we have another type of jewelry that usually hangs from a

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
necklace just like a pendant.

121
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,720
But on this occasion, it's a locket.

122
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Okay.

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,360
A locket is something that usually women will wear around their necks.

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Now this is like a pendant, but it opens.

125
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
So it's something that can open up.

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,540
And sometimes people have photographs inside.

127
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,000
Many times they're shaped like a heart or a book.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
And inside you can see a picture or a note, something very personal.

129
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay.

130
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Very good.

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,440
So it's very similar to a pendant, but as you said, it opens up.

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
You see it all the time in movies.

133
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
People have pendants and inside they have a nice picture of someone.

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
That's right.

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
So that's a locket.

136
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
All right.

137
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Very good.

138
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,400
I think we've taken a look at a lot of vocab related to jewelry here.

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,520
Why don't we go back?

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Let's review this dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

141
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,580
Good afternoon, sir.

142
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,640
Is there anything I can help you with today?

143
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,280
Yeah, I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

144
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

145
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,560
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

146
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

147
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,440
No, not really.

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,480
I'm completely at a loss.

149
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart shaped pendant.

150
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,360
What is her favorite gemstone?

151
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
That purple one.

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Don't worry.

155
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,160
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,640
That stone is an amethyst.

157
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,020
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

158
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,000
Take a look at this bracelet.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,280
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

160
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,600
It's a great statement piece.

161
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
Oh, wow.

162
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,200
That's really pretty.

163
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,920
Jess would love that.

164
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,060
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

165
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,520
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

166
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,680
You could also get her a timepiece.

167
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,600
It's both glamorous and functional.

168
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,040
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

169
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Jess?

170
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
Well, she's very smart.

171
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,540
She's a great sense of humor.

172
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,740
She's very feminine.

173
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,800
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

174
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

175
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,480
I've just been so nervous.

176
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay, I've decided.

178
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
I'm going to pop the question.

179
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Fabulous.

180
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,040
We should look at engagement rings then.

181
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,120
Now, that's a whole other section.

182
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,520
All right, we're back.

183
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,240
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

184
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Fluency Builder.

185
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,440
So the first phrase in Fluency Builder today comes from the beginning of our dialogue where

186
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,000
Mark says to the shop assistant, listen, I'm completely at a loss.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,600
So what does he mean when he told the shopkeeper, I'm completely at a loss?

189
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,120
At a loss means I have no idea.

190
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm really confused.

191
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Okay.

192
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,240
All right, I need help.

193
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,360
So if a teacher asks you a question and you don't know the answer, you can say, I'm sorry,

194
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
I'm at a loss.

195
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm at a loss.

196
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,240
Or when I see someone and they say, hi, how you doing?

197
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
They say, oh, I'm so embarrassed.

198
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm really at a loss.

199
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
I don't remember your name.

200
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
Okay, very good.

201
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,960
So I'm at a loss.

202
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Now when Mark was describing his girlfriend, Jess, he said, well, she's very smart and

203
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,560
has a great sense of humor.

204
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Okay.

205
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,120
So sense of humor is a characteristic that we give to people.

206
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,240
So he has no sense of humor or she has a great sense of humor.

207
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,440
And this means that this person likes to tell jokes and is funny and enjoys a good time

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
really.

209
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,000
So does it mean that this person is not really that serious or always angry or unhappy?

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,840
No, not an overly serious person.

211
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,400
It generally means that the person is good at telling jokes and makes you laugh.

212
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Okay.

213
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,040
So Jess has a good sense of humor and because of all these things and they've been together

214
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,960
for five years, Mark says, okay, I've decided I'm going to pop the question.

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,220
Okay, this might sound very strange because you think, well, pop the question.

216
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
What is the question?

217
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,280
Well, in English, the phrase pop the question has a very special meaning.

218
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,520
Means to ask someone to marry you.

219
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,960
So if I say I'm going to pop the question, that means I'm going to ask someone to marry

220
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
me.

221
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
That's right.

222
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,240
Or you could say he popped the question last night.

223
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
We're engaged.

224
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Okay.

225
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
So that means?

226
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
He asked me to marry him.

227
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Okay.

228
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
All right.

229
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
So it's a phrase to pop the question.

230
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,160
So whenever you use it together, you're talking about asking someone to marry you.

231
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Exactly.

232
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
All right.

233
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Great stuff.

234
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,920
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

235
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,320
Good afternoon, sir.

236
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,280
Is there anything I can help you with today?

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,000
Um, yeah, I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

239
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,280
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

240
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,200
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

241
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,180
No, not really.

242
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm completely at a loss.

243
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:52,640
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

244
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,080
What is her favorite gemstone?

245
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
That purple one.

246
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,880
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

248
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Don't worry.

249
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,880
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

250
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,360
That stone is an amethyst.

251
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,740
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

252
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,720
Take a look at this bracelet.

253
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,000
It's 18-karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,260
It's a great statement piece.

255
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,400
Oh, wow.

256
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,920
That's really pretty.

257
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,640
Jess would love that.

258
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,780
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

259
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,240
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

260
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,400
You could also get her a timepiece.

261
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,320
It's both glamorous and functional.

262
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,760
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

263
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Jess?

264
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,400
Well, she's very smart.

265
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,240
She's a great sense of humor.

266
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,460
She's very feminine.

267
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,520
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

268
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,240
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

269
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,200
I've just been so nervous.

270
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,360
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

271
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Okay, I've decided.

272
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,400
I'm going to pop the question.

273
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,440
Fabulous.

274
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,800
We should look at engagement rings then.

275
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,200
Now, that's a whole other section.

276
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,160
So talking about jewelry and all of these gemstones, we also took a look at different

277
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,720
metal types.

278
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,160
We talked about gold, which is I think one of the most popular types of metals.

279
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
That's right.

280
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
It's kind of like a yellow color.

281
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,920
Now, when we talk about gold, we talk about 14 karat, 18 karat, 24 karat, stuff like this.

282
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Yeah.

283
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,440
So the karat, usually it's abbreviated like a K, 18K, 14K.

284
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,640
It means how pure the gold is.

285
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,840
Okay.

286
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,760
And actually, they also use it in diamonds.

287
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,360
They talk about a diamond that's one karat or two karats.

288
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Right.

289
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,760
So in diamonds, it has a different meaning.

290
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,400
It actually means how much the diamond weighs.

291
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,040
So some engagement rings are half a karat or a karat.

292
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,640
And the really, really, really big ones are like two karats, and those are very expensive.

293
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
That's right.

294
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,080
And we also saw another metal here, platinum, which is a very nice metal.

295
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,060
It looks like silver, but it's stronger.

296
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,120
It's much stronger, so you can hit something and it won't leave an impression.

297
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
It won't change the look of the metal.

298
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,200
And this is very popular right now for wedding bands.

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,280
You know those rings that men and women get after they're married?

300
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,600
Many people like to get this silvery-looking platinum ring.

301
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
I've actually seen different types of metals that weren't mentioned in the dialogue, like

302
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,280
titanium rings.

303
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,480
Titanium is also a very strong metal.

304
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,600
I can't remember this metal, but it's used on spacecraft, and it's very, very strong,

305
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
stronger than titanium.

306
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know what it is.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,560
And yeah, they also make rings out of it.

308
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,680
But another interesting thing is some people make their own rings, their wedding bands

309
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
or their wedding rings.

310
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
I've seen that.

311
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,760
It's a very nice thing to do, I think, because it's meaningful.

312
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,720
People like to do it together, and then they have these rings that are very special for

313
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
them.

314
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,520
So a person that makes jewelry or makes rings is called a jeweler, right?

315
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,340
A jeweler, that's right.

316
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,640
So I have a friend who is a jeweler.

317
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,040
He makes beautiful rings and earrings.

318
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Okay.

319
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,560
So not only rings, a person that makes jewelry in general can be called a jeweler.

320
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Exactly.

321
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
All right.

322
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,720
A very interesting topic, especially for the girls who always love to have rings and diamonds

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
and necklaces.

324
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Or the boys.

325
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,280
I know some boys really like to get earrings or to have jewelry like a ring.

326
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,040
I've never really seen too many guys wearing necklaces, though.

327
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,080
A lot of guys wear cross necklaces, I've seen.

328
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,800
Or rings, not too many rings.

329
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't think it's a big thing.

330
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Wedding rings?

331
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Wedding rings, yeah.

332
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
A lot of American guys wear rings.

333
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Do you wear them?

334
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
Yeah, I think, well, not a lot, but some do.

335
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,280
So well, obviously it's popular all around and of course we are interested in hearing

336
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
from you guys.

Talk to you nuts.
