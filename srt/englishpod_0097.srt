00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,280
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,600
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,480
And today we are going to be talking about the weather.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
That's right.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,200
And you know, Marco, this is a really, really useful and important topic in English, isn't

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
it?

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,480
Exactly, because if you ever travel abroad, you always want to know about the weather,

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
right?

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
That's right.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,400
And Anglo people, English people, all they ever do is talk about the weather.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,040
Well, it's an important topic.

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,120
You want to know what clothes to wear or if you should take an umbrella.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,400
Or even when you're making small talk with people.

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Exactly.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,720
So we are going to be taking a look at the weather in the United States.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,880
But before we get started with the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,520
Okay, so we have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,840
Now the first one is forecast.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Forecast.

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,200
Weather forecast.

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,080
So this is what we listen to or what we see on the television, the weather forecast.

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Right, it's like the prediction of the weather.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,960
Okay, so forecast, can I only use it in the weather?

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,400
No, of course you can use it in many other different situations, like in business, for

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,160
example, forecast sales.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,400
Okay, so the prediction of sales.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Very good.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
And we have one more word on vocabulary preview, a shower.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
A shower.

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Shower.

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Shower.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,840
So when it rains for a short time and it's not too heavy, that's a shower.

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,160
Okay, very good.

37
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,640
So it's very similar to a shower at home.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Right.

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
A little bit of water.

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
And it doesn't last too long.

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,880
Okay, very good.

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,420
So why don't we listen to our dialogue now.

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:48,720
We are going to be listening to the weatherman as he describes the weather in Utah.

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,240
And now let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, Salt Lake City.

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,920
What's the weather looking like today, Kenny?

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,080
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,280
We've got heavy cloud cover here in northern Utah, and we're calling for scattered showers

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,960
throughout the day, with a daytime high of 45 degrees.

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in.

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,840
We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold, with temperatures hovering around

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
the 30 degree mark.

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,560
It's a chilly day, folks, so don't forget your coats.

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
What about tomorrow, Kenny?

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Do you have good news for us?

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,960
Well, it'll be a rainy day for northern Utah.

57
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,600
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,280
Winds will be coming in from the northeast, with gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening.

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,960
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,080
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers.

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,600
Later in the day, we can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

63
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
You heard it, folks.

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,720
It's going to be a cold one.

65
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,200
That's right, Bill.

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,120
We'll have more later on today on the 6 o'clock news.

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,800
That's the weather forecast for this morning.

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:00,200
All right, so we listened to the weather forecast and it doesn't seem like nice weather in Utah,

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
huh?

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
No, it certainly doesn't.

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,440
I don't think that I'd really like to live there.

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
Well, maybe it's winter or something like that.

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,720
Well, I guess, yeah, maybe it's good for skiing.

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Okay, so now I think it's time for us to take a look at some of those maybe difficult words

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,760
that we may have listened to in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

76
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Language Takeaway.

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,960
All right, here we're going to look at some words and phrases that you can use to describe

78
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
the weather.

79
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,440
Now, the first one, we heard in the weather forecast that they were calling for scattered

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
showers.

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
Scattered showers.

82
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Scatter.

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,400
Scattered, if something is scattered.

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,680
It's sort of like it's a little bit of that thing everywhere.

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Okay, so and we already talked about what showers were.

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,400
Right, so shower is a small amount of rain.

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Okay, very good.

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,880
To better understand when something is scattered, imagine that we are in a playground and the

89
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,360
children are playing in the playground.

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,440
So the children are scattered everywhere.

91
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,200
Some of them are playing on the swing.

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,180
Some of them are playing on the grass or in the sandbox.

93
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,920
So children, a little bit of children in every different spot.

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,560
So if we think that the city is a playground, maybe in one part of the city there's a little

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,520
bit of rain but not in the other part.

96
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Exactly.

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
That's a scattered shower.

98
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Very good.

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,600
Moving on to our second word, we have hovering.

100
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,280
Hovering.

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,320
Temperatures hovering around the 30-degree mark.

102
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,480
The temperature is hovering around.

103
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,440
Okay, so when I say the temperatures are hovering.

104
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
You mean it's approximately.

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,280
Okay, so they can move up and down.

106
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,440
So maybe it'll be a little bit warmer than 30 degrees or a little bit colder.

107
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Yes.

108
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
So if you think of hovering as floating.

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Okay, very good.

110
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,000
So why don't we listen to some more examples of how we could use hovering in different

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,880
situations.

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,480
Example 1.

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,560
Government rates are hovering around the 10% mark despite the government's attempts to

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,280
stimulate the economy.

115
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,560
Example 2.

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,520
The waiters kept hovering around us all night.

117
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,840
It was really annoying.

118
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,440
Example 3.

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,280
The company's margin this year is hovering around the 40% mark.

120
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,380
Okay, so pretty clear.

121
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,760
Hovering is sort of floating around one area.

122
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Very good.

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,620
Now, let's move on to the next part.

124
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,800
We saw that we're going to have isolated downpours.

125
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
Isolated downpours.

126
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
Isolated downpours.

127
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,520
Okay, let's break this one down.

128
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,280
Let's start with downpour.

129
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,640
A downpour is when you have a lot of rain, very strong rain.

130
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
That's right.

131
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,440
For maybe a short amount of time, it's really raining heavily.

132
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Right.

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
So that's what a downpour is.

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
And if we take a look at the first word, isolated.

135
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,080
So in one small area.

136
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Okay, confined it to a specific area.

137
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
That's right.

138
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,840
Okay, so we have an isolated downpour.

139
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,920
It'll be raining in one specific area.

140
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,720
And you hear this a lot with weather language.

141
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,680
You hear isolated showers, isolated snow storms.

142
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Exactly.

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
So it'll be in a specific area only.

144
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
All right.

145
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,560
So along with these showers and rain, we also talked about wind.

146
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,040
And we heard that we will have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

147
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,440
So we're going to have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

148
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Gusts of wind.

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,920
Okay, so can you explain to our listeners what gusts are?

150
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,240
Okay, so a gust is a sudden increase in the amount of wind.

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,280
Okay, so maybe we'll have normal wind and all of a sudden it will get really windy.

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
That's right.

153
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
For a short amount of time.

154
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Okay, that's a gust.

155
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
G-U-S-T, gust.

156
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,920
Gust of wind.

157
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,120
And for our final word on Language Takeaway today, we're going to have sleet.

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Sleet.

159
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Sleet.

160
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,840
All right, sleet is a terrible kind of weather.

161
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,760
It's sort of a mixture between snow and rain.

162
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,300
So sleet is kind of this strange mix between ice and rain and snow.

163
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,000
So just imagine, it's not completely ice, so it's not solid, but it's not water, right?

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's not rain.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And it's not snow either.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, it's in the middle.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All right, so sleet.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,880
But what you really need to know is that it's terrible.

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,800
All right, so that's all the words we have today for Language Takeaway.

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,960
Let's move on now to Fluency Builder.

172
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Fluency Builder.

173
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,480
All right, in Fluency Builder today, we're going to look at three phrases that are really

174
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,680
common when you're talking about the weather.

175
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,960
Now we heard in the dialogue that there was a cold front moving in.

176
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,120
A cold front moving in.

177
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
A cold front is moving in.

178
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,280
Okay, so a cold front.

179
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,120
Imagine a wall of cold air and it comes towards a place and then it changes the pressure in

180
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
the atmosphere.

181
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,840
Okay, so a very sudden amount of cold air that comes into a place.

182
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Right.

183
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,360
So we say a cold front is moving in.

184
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,360
So we always think of these cold fronts or warm fronts as moving.

185
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,960
So you can either say they're moving in or you can say a cold front is coming in.

186
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,040
Okay, very good.

187
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,400
And okay, we have a cold front that's moving in and we're going to have winds that will

188
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
be coming in from the northeast.

189
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,960
Okay, winds coming in from.

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,240
Okay, winds coming in from.

191
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,560
So when I say it's coming in from.

192
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,480
You're talking about its origin, where it starts.

193
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:44,160
Okay, so if I change the noun and I don't say winds anymore but maybe I'll say my friends.

194
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,440
My friends are coming in from Chicago.

195
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,840
So they are arriving from Chicago.

196
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Exactly.

197
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
So what else can I say?

198
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,040
Or you can also say the kids are coming in from outside.

199
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay, so where they were before.

200
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Very good.

201
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
So coming in from.

202
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,560
You can change the noun a little bit and you can form these new sentences.

203
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Great.

204
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Now our final phrase.

205
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,640
We heard the announcer say it's going to be a cold one.

206
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,080
It's going to be a cold one.

207
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,600
It's going to be a cold one.

208
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,320
So I have this phrase, it's going to be a cold one.

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,080
What do I mean by a cold one?

210
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,800
Okay, so the one represents the event.

211
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Of the day.

212
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,160
Okay, so it's going to be a cold day.

213
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Yes.

214
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Okay.

215
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,320
Now we can obviously change the adjective, right?

216
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,400
So it's going to be a hot one, it's going to be a long one, it's going to be a long

217
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
day.

218
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Alright.

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,960
But the one can mean anything.

220
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay, so it can be a day, it can be an event.

221
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
A meeting.

222
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Okay.

223
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
A project.

224
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,800
So for example, if we're going to a meeting, I might say, hey Marco, this is going to be

225
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
a hard one.

226
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
Okay, so the one represents the meeting.

227
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
That's right.

228
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
A hard meeting.

229
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,560
Alright, I think this is a very good phrase and it's very commonly used, so why don't

230
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,920
we listen to some more examples of how we can use it's going to be a something one.

231
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Example one.

232
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,160
Temperatures are forecasted to hit 37 degrees today.

233
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,440
It's going to be a hot one, folks.

234
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
Example two.

235
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,960
It's only 8am and I've got a hundred emails already.

236
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,800
It's going to be a long one today.

237
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Example three.

238
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,920
I haven't studied at all for the exam.

239
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
It's going to be a tough one.

240
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,560
Okay, so some great examples and I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again

241
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,280
and now we can understand all these words and phrases that we've just talked about.

242
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,800
And now, let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.

243
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,120
Thank you Bill and good morning Salt Lake City.

244
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,360
What's the weather looking like today, Kenny?

245
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,640
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

246
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,840
We've got heavy cloud cover here in northern Utah and we're calling for scattered showers

247
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,560
throughout the day with a daytime high of 45 degrees.

248
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,520
Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in.

249
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,400
We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold with temperatures hovering around

250
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
the 30 degree mark.

251
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,120
It's a chilly day, folks, so don't forget your coats.

252
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
What about tomorrow, Kenny?

253
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Do you have good news for us?

254
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,480
Well, it'll be a rainy day for northern Utah.

255
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

256
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,760
Winds will be coming in from the northeast with gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

257
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,920
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening.

258
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

259
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,600
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers.

260
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,120
Later in the day, we can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

261
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
You heard it, folks.

262
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
It's going to be a cold one.

263
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,720
That's right, Bill.

264
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
We'll have more later on today on the 6 o'clock news.

265
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,080
That's the weather forecast for this morning.

266
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,880
Okay, so we know that in English-speaking countries, the weather is always, always,

267
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,760
always a great subject of conversation for small talk, right?

268
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Exactly.

269
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,720
If you ever want to talk to somebody or start a conversation, the weather is always the

270
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,840
number one topic.

271
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Yep.

272
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,840
And we actually have a phrase in this dialogue that would be great for starting a conversation.

273
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,560
Like for example, imagine if you lived here in Utah and you were, you know, wanting to

274
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,960
start a conversation with someone, you could say, it sure is a cold one today, isn't it?

275
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Exactly.

276
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,080
That's a great way of starting a conversation and English-speaking people love to talk about

277
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
the weather, as you say.

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
That's right.

279
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,920

280
