00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine and we're going to a family party today, right Marco?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're going to go see our family, our relatives and we're going to talk about all the different

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
family members that you can have.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,500
So, there are some very, very specific family members that sometimes you don't really know

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
the names of.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
That's right.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
So, we're not talking about mother, father, brother, sister.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're talking about what we call in English extended family.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, that means not just the people you live with but also people you're related to who

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
are maybe in different parts of your family.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's right.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What are you doing this weekend?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A bit of both.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there but also some friends from the neighborhood.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Is your great-uncle Rick going to be there?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He is really funny.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You mean your sister?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No, Rick is actually my great-uncle so he's my grandmother's brother.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You lost me.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll explain later.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, so now let's talk about these family members on Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Language Takeaway

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, Marco, we've got four family members to talk about today.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And the first one is brother-in-law.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Right, so we have the word brother-in-law.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, basically this person is married to your sister.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, I have a brother, I have a sister.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But when these people marry, they marry someone who I'm not related to by blood.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We call them in-laws, so brother-in-law, sister-in-law.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right, so that's exactly it.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The key there is that when it has the ending in-law, it means that you're not related to them by blood.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's your extended family because of marriage.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, I have a younger brother.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When he gets married, I will have a sister-in-law.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it applies to, for example, father-in-law.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That would be your husband's dad or mother-in-law would be your husband's mother.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, so these are all related to you by marriage.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, so now moving on to the next type of extended family member that we have is a stepson.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your uncle has a stepson.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, a stepson.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now, this can get very confusing.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's take a simple, simple family.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We have two people and they're married.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And then they get divorced, so they split up.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And now maybe they had some kids.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The wife has kids, and she gets married to someone else.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So, her new husband calls her son his stepson.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because it's not his son.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's another man's son.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Right.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But they're still related by marriage.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, when your new husband or your new wife has kids from another marriage, they're called stepson, stepdaughter.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, it's the same thing as if my mother got divorced and she remarried.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She has a new husband.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That man would be my stepfather.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right, so these are all family members.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When you hear the word step, family members that we have because of divorce.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, stepson, stepdaughter, stepfather, stepmother.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, and now, again, related to the whole divorce thing, the person that you get divorced to is called an ex-wife or an ex-husband.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All right, so ex, like ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend means previous.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, my ex-wife is someone I was married to before or in the case of a woman, my ex-husband was someone I was married to before, but we got divorced.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, we're not married now.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's exactly it.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So, it only applies to husband and wife, right?

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You don't say my ex-children or my ex-mother-in-law.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, because your children are always your children.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
All right.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you talk about your ex-wife's parents, you just say my ex-wife's father or my ex-wife's mother because there's no more in-law.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There's no law.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're not married.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Right, okay.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And lastly, now we have an uncle, but just not any uncle.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We have our great uncle.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Great uncle.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, they actually explain this in the dialogue.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They say, he is my grandmother's brother.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, so my uncle, this is simple.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My uncle is my mother's brother or my father's brother.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Easy.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But my great uncle is one of my grandparent's brothers.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, my grandmother's brother or my grandfather's brother.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In English, we don't distinguish.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We don't say a different word for grandmother's brother or grandfather's brother.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right, right, exactly.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, your great uncle could be either your grandmother's brother or your grandfather's brother.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, in my family, I have, well, I just have one great uncle and one great aunt.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My grandmother has a sister, so I have a great aunt, and my grandfather has a brother, so I have a great uncle.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And now, the prefix great can also be applied, for example, to grandparents.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, you can say, my great grandfather.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, we're talking about generations.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I have a grandfather, but his father is my great grandfather.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That means we go back in the past one more generation.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's right.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
All right, so let's take a break and let's listen to the dialogue again.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What are you doing this weekend?

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house, and he invited me.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A bit of both.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there?

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He is really funny.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You mean your sister?

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You lost me.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll explain later.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right, we're back.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So, we've picked out three key phrases for you.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Fluency Builder.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right, so on Fluency Builder, we have a great noun here, actually.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You might have heard this before in a different way, but in today's dialogue, we're talking

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
about a small get-together.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, what is a get-together, Mark?

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right, so as you notice, we say a get-together, meaning that get-together, we are taking it

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
as a noun.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And it may be confusing because you see the verb get, right?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And you're thinking it's a verb, but no.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A get-together is a reunion, a meeting.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
All right, a party.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A party.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So, maybe it's a very informal party, very casual.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Not fancy.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
A get-together.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I could say, Marco, I'm having a get-together at my apartment.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you want to come and bring your girlfriend?

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right, so very simple.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe we have a drink or some food, but it's nothing fancy.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Very informal, very casual.

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A get-together.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And when we were asking about the get-together, we asked if it's a family thing or is it just

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
friends?

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, I want to take a look at this phrase here, a family thing.

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it a family thing?

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What am I asking when I say, okay, Marco, this party you're having, is it a family thing?

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, you're asking if it's a family reunion, a family party.

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, that means if I'm not in your family, can I still come?

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Right.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right, because if it's a family thing, it's just for people in my family.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right, right.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If it's for everyone, no problem.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I don't want to go to your house if it's a family thing because that's private.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right, so usually, for example, maybe Christmas dinner would usually be a family thing.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You celebrate it with your family mostly, but it's not always a family thing.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I could say, this year my birthday is just a family thing.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm only inviting family members.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Exactly.

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right, and lastly, we got a little bit confused with the great uncle and the stepson

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and the ex-wife.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And so, we said, you know what?

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You lost me.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You lost me.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You lost me.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now, this is another great phrase.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The phrase means, I don't understand.

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm confused.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Right, that's exactly it.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, if someone is explaining something and I don't understand, then you can say, you

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
know what?

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You lost me.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't understand.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Right, and sometimes I say this when someone is giving a very long explanation for something.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, to get to my house, you turn left here and then you go two blocks, you turn right

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and you go straight and you wait for the stoplight.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then you go to the right-hand corner, there's a store.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I say, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You lost me.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right, exactly.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't understand.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm confused.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's right.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All right, so that's all we have.

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What are you doing this weekend?

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is it a family thing or just friends?

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A bit of both.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is your great-uncle Rick going to be there?

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He is really funny.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You mean your sister?

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No, Rick is actually my great-uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You lost me.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll explain later.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, speaking of extended family members, what else can we mention?

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We have stepfamily, your stepson, your stepdaughter.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What about if you have an adopted child?

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Would you differentiate it?

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Some people do, some people don't.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Most people just say, this is my son, this is my daughter.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But I would like to add that with stepson, stepdaughter, it's not just divorce that we have this.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Also, if the parent, maybe the mother dies and the father has a new wife,

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
then the new wife can say, this is my stepson, this is my stepdaughter.

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So, there are two possibilities.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
One is death and one is remarriage because of divorce.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But as far as adopted, no, usually just say my son and my daughter.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But I can tell you this.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If my father and my mother divorce, my father has a new wife, and together they have a baby,

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the baby, boy or girl, is my half-brother or half-sister because we share one parent, my father.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right. This is very interesting.

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So, if you do have a brother or sister that is not from your same mother or father,

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but just one parent, then yeah, it's called a half-brother or sister.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Half, remember this, half because half of their parents are the same as your parents.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe one father or mother.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But with stepbrothers and stepsisters, the only reason you're related is because of marriage, not because of blood.

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Right. We didn't mention that you could have a stepbrother.

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, it's your brother, but he's legally your brother, but he's not related to your father or anyone in your family.

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's right. That's right.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, maybe you have many stepbrothers.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You could have a stepbrother and a half-brother.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, there are lots of different combinations because of many different reasons.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right, guys. That's all the time we have for today.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But it's a little bit of a confusing topic.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So, if you have any questions or any doubts, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and you can leave them there.

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, we hope to see you guys online. And until next time.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Bye.
