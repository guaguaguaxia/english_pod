00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,120
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,440
And today we have another romantic lesson, kind of romantic.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,400
A little romantic.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,800
We got a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they're apologizing to each other.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,500
Okay, so it's a very common situation and we're going to be talking about love.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,060
We're also going to talk about different pet names that are commonly used in English.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,360
That are used with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, very good.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what's happening with our couple.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,620
Can we talk?

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,900
You know what I mean.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,300
I want to know where this relationship is going.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm in love with you and I need to know.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm awesome.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,860
Well I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

18
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,980
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing, alright?

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,940
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate...

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,300
Maybe it's just time we...

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,140
Baby, I love you so much.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
You do?

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,260
I love you and I think you're awesome.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,780
Oh, I love you too.

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,300
Come on, put the gun down.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,180
Oh baby, I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,460
Okay, so romantic and dramatic.

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,100
Yeah, I think she really needed to hear that shh.

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,300
Right, so I think she really wanted to hear I love you.

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,700
Yeah, that's right.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,860
And there's some interesting phrases here in this dialogue and today we're going to

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,220
focus mostly on phrases.

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,780
So why don't we start with Fluency Builder.

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Fluency Builder.

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,260
Okay, on Fluency Builder today, we're going to take a look at some of these phrases and

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,280
the first one is very important and very different.

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,260
So obviously this dialogue is about love and we heard two different ways that this word

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,860
is used and the first one is to love someone.

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,380
Right, so he said, I love you.

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,900
Yeah, I love you.

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,020
We all pretty much understand what that means.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,740
Right, but they also mentioned to be in love with someone.

43
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,300
Okay, so he said, I am in love with you.

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
I'm in love with you.

45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
In love.

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,260
Okay, so what's the difference between to love and to be in love?

47
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,300
To be in love with someone means that you have these strong romantic feelings towards

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
somebody.

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
That's right.

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,700
So you can only be in love with your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your husband or your wife.

51
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,100
So you can love your parents, you can love your family, but you can't be in love with

52
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
them.

53
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,820
You can only be in love with your girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife.

54
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
That's right.

55
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Okay.

56
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,140
So moving on to the next phrase.

57
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,820
Now the girl asked her boyfriend, can we talk?

58
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Can we talk?

59
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,940
Can we talk?

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,380
This is a very simple sentence.

61
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,460
Right, we know the meaning, right?

62
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,580
But why does she say, can we talk?

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,340
Okay, so you use this when you want to start a conversation about something serious.

64
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,180
Okay, so if you wanted to talk to me about my new shirt.

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,460
I wouldn't ask, I wouldn't say, hey Marco, can we talk?

66
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,100
Oh, I really like your shirt.

67
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,100
Where'd you get it?

68
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,100
Exactly, right?

69
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
It has to be serious.

70
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,620
It has to be serious.

71
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,300
So usually if somebody says, hey, can we talk?

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,580
It means that there's going to be a serious topic.

73
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,260
It's going to be probably bad news.

74
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,980
Maybe bad news.

75
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,160
So can we talk?

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,740
So if your boyfriend or girlfriend tells you this, well, it's not a good sign.

77
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
That's right.

78
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,740
All right.

79
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,700
And the last phrase that we have on Fluency Builder, you know what I mean.

80
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,240
You know what I mean.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,500
You know what I mean.

82
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
You know what I mean.

83
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
All right.

84
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,580
So again, this phrase is very simple to understand, right?

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,580
That's right.

86
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,100
So you know what I'm talking about.

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,300
You understand me.

88
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,780
But the interesting thing is that we can also make it a question.

89
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,220
And it's all about the change in tone.

90
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:35,100
Okay, so with this in mind, let's listen to two examples of the same phrase but with different

91
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,640
tones and you try to see which one is the question.

92
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,180
Example one.

93
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm tired of doing nothing all day here at home.

94
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,480
You know what I mean?

95
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,100
Example two.

96
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Come on, Charles.

97
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,100
You know what I mean when I say that I don't like your friends.

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,620
Example three.

99
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,820
I hate this class.

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,500
It's so boring and tedious.

101
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,780
You know what I mean?

102
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
All right.

103
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,140
So we heard the examples and well, maybe you guessed it right.

104
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,620
The second example was the question.

105
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,620
That's right.

106
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,620
You know what I mean?

107
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,620
Right.

108
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,780
So basically, you're asking the person if they understand your idea or they understand

109
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,100
what you're talking about.

110
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,780
So maybe you can say, the professor wasn't very clear on his instructions.

111
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,680
So how was I supposed to do the homework?

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
You know what I mean?

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,620
So you're asking me to confirm that I understand you.

114
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
My idea.

115
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,620
You understand what I'm saying?

116
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah.

117
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Okay.

118
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,340
So you might say, hey, I don't like going to your mom's house.

119
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,340
So I would say, what?

120
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
What do you mean?

121
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340
Why?

122
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
You know what I mean?

123
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
Right.

124
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,220
So I perfectly understand or know the reasons why you don't like going to my mom's house.

125
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Like I don't have to tell you.

126
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
You know what I mean?

127
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
All right.

128
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
Very good.

129
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
So you know what I mean.

130
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
Great.

131
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,900
So we've taken a look at these four phrases.

132
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,860
They're very simple, but the way that you use them gives them different meanings.

133
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
That's right.

134
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
All right.

135
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,140
So let's listen to our dialogue for the second time.

136
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:14,460
Just slow it down a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Can we talk?

138
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
Sure, honey.

139
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,100
We're talking now, aren't we?

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
You know what I mean.

141
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,380
Yeah, I know.

142
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,780
I want to know where this relationship is going.

143
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm in love with you, and I need to know...

144
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,220
You know, I think you're awesome.

145
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,220
I'm awesome.

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,860
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

147
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Honey.

148
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,460
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing, all right?

149
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,420
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate...

150
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Maybe it's just time we...

151
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,600
Baby, I love you so much.

152
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
You do?

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,740
I love you, and I think you're awesome.

154
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,620
Oh, I love you too.

155
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,180
Come on, put the gun down.

156
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,220
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

157
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,740
Okay, so now it's time for us to take a look at some more phrases, but this time we're

158
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,940
going to look at them in putting it together.

159
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
Putting it together.

160
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,260
Okay, we're going to see how we can use these phrases in a few different situations.

161
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,760
So the girl wanted to talk to her boyfriend because she wanted to know where this relationship

162
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
is going.

163
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Right.

164
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,060
Where is this relationship going?

165
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,860
Where is this relationship going?

166
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,060
So she wants to know what's going to happen or what's...

167
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
What's the future.

168
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
What's the future of this relationship?

169
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,740
Are we going to get married?

170
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Are we just...

171
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
What's happening?

172
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
Yeah.

173
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,940
So why don't we listen to some examples with different nouns and how we can use this phrase?

174
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
Example one.

175
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,940
I don't know where my career is going in this company.

176
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,780
I don't see any potential for growth.

177
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,660
Example two.

178
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
This movie is so confusing.

179
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,460
I have no idea where the plot is going.

180
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,740
Example three.

181
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,780
We have been in this meeting for over two hours and I still don't know where it's going.

182
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,820
Okay, so again, this phrase is just asking about the future of something.

183
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Right.

184
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,300
So where the future of this movie, where is this movie going?

185
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,580
Yeah, what's happening?

186
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Right.

187
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
What's going to happen?

188
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Yeah.

189
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
Or your career, etc.

190
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Yeah.

191
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Okay.

192
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,980
So, she was talking a little bit about her feelings and she said, maybe it's just time

193
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
we...

194
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Okay.

195
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,580
So this phrase isn't complete yet.

196
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
We need to finish it.

197
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
Yeah.

198
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,020
But she is basically saying, maybe we should do this.

199
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,180
How can we finish the phrase?

200
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
All right.

201
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,500
So she could say, maybe it's just time we break up.

202
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
All right.

203
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,620
Or I can say, maybe it's time we have a baby.

204
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,340
Oh, Marco.

205
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,740
All right.

206
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,780
And maybe it's time we go home.

207
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Okay.

208
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
So it's getting late, let's go home.

209
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,100
Maybe it's time we go home.

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Yeah.

211
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,820
So this is how we can finish this phrase.

212
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,620
And what about our last phrase?

213
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,380
So she also said, we've had our laps.

214
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
Okay.

215
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,740
So that means we've had our good times.

216
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Yeah.

217
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Okay.

218
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,180
But we can change this to, we've had our ups and downs.

219
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Okay.

220
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,100
Or we've had our moments.

221
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Right.

222
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,940
So that means we've had our good moments and our bad moments.

223
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
That's right.

224
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,780
Or we've had our issues.

225
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Okay.

226
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,500
So that means we've had some problems.

227
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,700
We've had some difficulties.

228
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,100
Or even we've had our moments.

229
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Okay.

230
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
So that means we've had...

231
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Special times.

232
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,540
So that means we've had our special times, special occasions that we will always remember.

233
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
That's right.

234
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
Okay.

235
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,180
So three really useful structures that you can change the words a little bit to slightly

236
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,340
change the meaning.

237
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Okay.

238
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,300
So it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time.

239
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,420
Now we're ready to understand everything.

240
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:15,540
And then we'll come back and give you some examples of pet names in English.

241
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,180
Can we talk?

242
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,460
You know what I mean.

243
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,860
I want to know where this relationship is going.

244
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,340
I'm in love with you and I need to know...

245
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
I'm awesome.

246
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,260
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

247
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,700
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

248
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
All right.

249
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate...

250
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,860
Maybe it's just time we...

251
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,700
Baby, I love you so much.

252
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
You do?

253
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,820
I love you and I think you're awesome.

254
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,340
Oh, I love you too.

255
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,900
Come on, put the gun down.

256
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
Oh, baby.

257
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm so sorry.

258
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,220
All right.

259
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,780
Well, Marco, you mentioned this word pet names.

260
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,900
And what exactly is that?

261
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
All right.

262
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,180
So pet names aren't names for your dogs or your cats.

263
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Okay.

264
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Right.

265
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,460
So pet names that you would call your boyfriend or girlfriend.

266
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Okay.

267
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
So like baby.

268
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Okay.

269
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
In our dialogue, we heard baby.

270
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Yeah.

271
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Right?

272
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
So we're not talking about a little...

273
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,460
A little child.

274
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
A little child.

275
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
No.

276
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,580
This is usually how you would call maybe your girlfriend or boyfriend, baby.

277
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
Or honey.

278
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
Honey.

279
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
Right.

280
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580
Hey, honey.

281
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
Or honey, I'm home.

282
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Yeah.

283
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,580
Right.

284
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,340
But we also have other ones like sweetheart or...

285
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Darling.

286
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Darling.

287
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Yeah.

288
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,580
Or what about sweetie or cutie?

289
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Cutie.

290
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Oh.

291
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Yeah.

292
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,140
I think these phrases can be a little bit like cheesy maybe.

293
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Yeah.

294
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
A little too sweet.

295
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Too much.

296
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
Yeah.

297
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Like snookums.

298
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Snookums.

299
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Snookums.

300
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Snookums.

301
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Like snookums.

302
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Okay.

303
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Or honey bunny.

304
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Oh, yeah.

305
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Yeah.

306
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
Yeah.

307
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
You also have sweetie pie.

308
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Yeah.

309
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Yeah.

310
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
And some of them will make some up, right?

311
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Maybe they'll call their boyfriend poo bear.

312
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,140
Oh, yeah.

313
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Right?

314
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,140
Yeah.

315
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,140
Like Winnie the Pooh, poo bear.

316
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,140
I heard dumpling is a common one.

317
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Yeah.

318
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
So, you can make up your own pet names, right?

319
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
Yeah.

320
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
So, I want to hear from our listeners.

321
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Are there any common pet names in your language?

322
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:30,140
I know that in Spanish, we can sometimes call our girlfriend gorda, which actually means

323
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,140
fat.

324
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,140
But it's not in a bad way.

325
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Really?

326
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,140
It's a sweet way of calling your girlfriend.

327
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,140
And I know in French, you can say ma pouce, which basically means my flea.

328
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Yeah.

329
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Yeah.

330
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,140
So, some of them, if you translate, you wouldn't really use in English.

331
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
But let us know.

332
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Translate from your language or other ones that you've heard maybe in movies or talk

333
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,140
shows.

334
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
And come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

335
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
Yeah.

336
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,140
Leave your questions there as well as your pet names.

337
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,140
And Marco and I are always happy to see you there.

338
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,140
Okay.

339
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Until next time.

340
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Goodbye.

341
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Bye.
