00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Hello everyone and welcome to another lesson at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,840
And I'm Catherine and today we're talking about shopping online.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,920
So this is an elementary level lesson.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
That's right.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,320
We are going to shop for things online.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,200
So before we get started with this dialogue, let's take a look at one word we have for

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,480
you on vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,120
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,080
Okay the word we're looking at today is eBay.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
eBay.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,840
Okay, so this is a proper noun.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,440
It's an actual website, ebay.com.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
That's right.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,040
It's kind of like a store on the internet for people who want to buy used things.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,240
Okay, so maybe if you have a TV that you don't want anymore, you go on eBay, you put pictures

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,720
of it online and you offer it and anyone can buy it.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
That's right.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,480
You can be a buyer, that means you buy things or a seller.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,800
So you sell things.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
So this is interesting.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,280
Usually you find used things on eBay but you can also find new things.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
You can.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,720
It's kind of like the Chinese website Taobao.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,920
I've actually even seen people selling cars on eBay.

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Cars?

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Yeah.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,760
I can't imagine buying a car on the internet.

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Really?

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,700
No, they have even very luxurious cars on eBay.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,880
So we'll talk about more about online shopping a little bit later on.

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,280
But now, why don't we listen to a dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:43,880
in just a little bit.

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,380
What are you doing?

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,280
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,800
You're shopping for a pillow online?

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
That's absurd.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Why?

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,120
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,320
This way, I just search for it online quick and easy.

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I see.

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
But how do you pay for it?

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,080
comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,600
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,840
So how do you pay?

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
Do you need a credit card?

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,800
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,880
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,800
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
You can find anything.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Are you sure you want to start shopping online though?

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Let's do it.

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Alright, we're back.

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,360
So now we have four key words for you on Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Language Takeaway.

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,280
The first word you might have already heard us use already.

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,360
We're talking about going on the internet to do something.

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,640
So we say to go online.

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Okay.

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,240
So by saying that you are going online, you say that you are using the internet.

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
That's right.

66
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,520
So you can shop for something online.

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Online means the internet, right?

68
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
On the internet.

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,920
So we don't say in the internet.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
We say we're on the internet.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,840
For example, he's been on the internet all day long.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,320
I want to use the computer.

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Okay, so I can say he's been online all day long.

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
That's right.

75
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Okay.

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,400
So that is online.

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,480
And when we go online and we are looking through different websites or maybe we are looking

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,640
at items on eBay, we are browsing.

79
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,800
Okay, the verb here is to browse.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,280
Now to browse is to look at, but not carefully.

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Just to look at with maybe the idea to shop or to buy later.

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Okay.

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,640
So you can use browse for online things, but you can also use it for physical things like

84
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,720
you are in a shop, you are browsing.

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
That's right.

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,960
So I can go to a clothing store and I can browse.

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,040
For example, if the woman at the clothing store says, would you like to buy something?

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
I say, no, I'm just browsing.

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm just looking.

90
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Okay.

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Very good.

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,600
And then when they were talking about eBay and how it works, the person mentioned that

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,480
they have a point system.

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
All right.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
A point system.

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,760
Now, this is something you hear about a lot on websites these days.

97
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,480
For example, many websites have different users.

98
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,360
And so how do I know which users or which in this case, sellers are the best?

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Well, we have a point system.

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,680
More points means better, fewer points means worse.

101
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
You might also call this a star system.

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,920
So basically a point system is a way to show who is a very good community member and who

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,120
is not.

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
That's right.

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
And that takes us to our next word.

106
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,880
So if a person has a lot of points in their point system, that means they are trustworthy.

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,320
Okay.

108
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,480
Trustworthy is an adjective.

109
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,120
He is trustworthy.

110
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,920
They are trustworthy.

111
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,720
This means that I can trust them.

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
They are reliable.

113
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
That's right.

114
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,400
So I don't think they will lie to me.

115
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,440
I don't think they will cheat me.

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Okay.

117
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,200
So a person can be trustworthy.

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
A company can be trustworthy.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,960
Or you could say, he never pays me back.

121
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,120
He's not very trustworthy when I lend him money.

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Okay.

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Very good.

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
So four key words there.

125
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
Why don't we listen to them again in our dialogue?

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,920
And we'll be back shortly.

127
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,420
What are you doing?

128
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
You're shopping for a pillow online?

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
That's absurd.

131
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Why?

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,200
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,400
This way, I just search for it online quick and easy.

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,820
I see.

135
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,480
But how do you pay for it?

136
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

137
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,080
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people

138
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,640
comment negatively.

139
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,160
And then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,680
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
So how do you pay?

142
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,360
Do you need a credit card?

143
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,880
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

144
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

145
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,560
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,880
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

147
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,640
You can find anything.

148
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Are you sure you want to start shopping online though?

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Let's do it.

151
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,680
All right, we're back.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,720
So now we have three key phrases that we saw in our dialogue.

153
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,760
And let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Fluency Builder.

155
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,640
Well, the first phrase we have here is related to that last word we had, trustworthy.

156
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,880
Someone is not trustworthy if they will rip you off.

157
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Okay.

158
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay, so it's a phrasal verb, to rip you off or to rip off.

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,120
To rip someone off.

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
That's right.

161
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,320
So, they ripped him off.

162
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,200
He ripped her off.

163
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,920
This means to steal money from someone or to cheat someone.

164
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Right.

165
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,160
So, let's say if a pair of shoes usually in a store costs $50 and then your friend sells

166
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,240
them to you for $200, your friend ripped you off.

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
That's right.

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
He ripped you off.

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
That's not a good friend.

170
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,640
He's not very trustworthy.

171
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,800
All right.

172
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,920
So now when they were talking about how safe it is to make purchases online, the person

173
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,920
explained that it's pretty safe and that no one has ever hacked his information.

174
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Okay.

175
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,120
So, this is an important verb that has to do with the internet.

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,600
To hack information is to steal information on the internet.

177
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,960
So, someone who hacks, who steals this information is called a hacker.

178
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay.

179
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,640
And this is something that's very bad.

180
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,960
We want to go to secure and safe websites because we don't want people to hack our personal

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
information.

182
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
That's right.

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,680
Okay, so the verb is to hack.

184
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
And finally, in the end when they were going to look for a sweater for a dog, the person

185
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
said, you know what?

186
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
This is great.

187
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,400
Are you sure you want to start to shop online?

188
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,920
Once you do this, there is no turning back.

189
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
Oh, I love this phrase.

190
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,120
There's no turning back.

191
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
So this is, well, you think about someone who's leaving.

192
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,620
You say there's no turning back.

193
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,760
You can't go back.

194
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,240
You can't return to where you were.

195
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,560
This is something we say as a warning.

196
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,080
So listen, this is your final decision.

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,080
If you say yes, you cannot change your mind.

198
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
You cannot say no later.

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
So you can't turn back later.

200
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
That's right.

201
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,880
So there's no turning back now.

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay, no turning back.

203
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Very good.

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,220
Interesting phrases, keywords and everything.

205
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,360
So we should listen to this dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk with you a

206
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:25,440
little bit more.

207
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,940
What are you doing?

208
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

209
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,360
You're shopping for a pillow online?

210
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
That's absurd.

211
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Why?

212
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,700
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

213
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,440
This way, I just search for it online quick and easy.

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
I see.

215
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
But how do you pay for it?

216
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,920
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

217
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people

218
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,120
comment negatively.

219
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,640
And then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

220
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,160
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

221
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,400
So how do you pay?

222
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
Do you need a credit card?

223
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,340
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

224
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,320
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

225
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,000
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,320
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

227
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,080
You can find anything.

228
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,880
Are you sure you want to start shopping online though?

229
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

230
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's do it.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Alright so now talking about online shopping, have you ever bought anything online?

232
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,480
Use your credit card online.

233
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I have.

234
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,200
I've used my credit card on Amazon.com to purchase books on the internet.

235
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,380
But I know that you are much more of a fan of online shopping.

236
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,560
You use the Chinese website Taobao all the time.

237
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Yeah.

238
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,880
Well actually, I wrote this dialogue and it's kind of based on something real because you

239
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,800
know sometimes going to the stores, it can be great and you can see things and physically

240
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,980
touch them.

241
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,280
But I'm a little bit more practical.

242
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,160
I know exactly what I want or maybe I saw it.

243
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,640
So I don't want to have to go to the stores and deal with haggling or negotiating or sometimes

244
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,880
it's even more expensive.

245
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,040
So I just, from the comfort of my own home, just put in my debit card number and buy things

246
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,680
online and I get it delivered overnight.

247
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,560
Well, and you never go shopping now.

248
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,720
Well, shopping you have to go to the clothing store for clothes, the video game store for

249
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
video games and on the internet, it's all in one place.

250
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,200
You're at home, you're in your pajamas, you use your credit card.

251
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,680
And the cool thing is that you can even, sometimes you want to buy small things.

252
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,480
Like in this case, maybe a pillow or you want to buy, like recently I bought some candles,

253
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,060
some decorative candles.

254
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,280
So I don't know, do you really want to go out downtown, look for the candle shop where

255
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
you can get them?

256
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
You can just do it online.

257
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,920
Do it online.

258
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
Let us know, do you shop on the internet?

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
If you do, what kind of services do you use?

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
What stores do you go to?

261
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Let us know.

262
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

263
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
We hope to see you there.

264
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
All right.

265
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Bye everyone.
