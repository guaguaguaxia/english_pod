00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,840
My name is Catherine and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson for all of

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
you.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,840
That's right.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,480
We're going to be talking business on this occasion on EnglishPod but specifically about

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,040
planning a business.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Right.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,440
So before a business opens, a lot of planning has to happen.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,520
That means people will decide what kind of a product they want to sell, what kind of

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,400
a market they want to sell to, etc.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,520
So that is the focus of today's lesson.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,920
Let's take a listen to the dialogue for the first time and we'll be back in a minute to

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:46,920
talk about what's going on.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,000
I've had it.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,080
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,320
So what are you going to do?

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,400
Just quit?

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,760
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
I've decided to create my own company.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,680
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,920
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Well, no.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
It can't be that hard.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business.

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
How are you going to do things?

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,720
And that's it, right?

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,120
You couldn't be more wrong.

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,640
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,400
idea of the business in two pages or less.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,140
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,400
it has, history, etc.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,880
Well that seems easy enough.

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,600
Wait, there's more!

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,440
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,240
different from competitors.

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,380
You need to investigate and analyse hundreds of variables.

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,440
You need to take into consideration socio-economic factors from GDP per capita to how many children

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,680
on average the population has.

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,120
stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Geez, is that all?

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Almost.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,440
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,800
Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,280
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,240
I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,720
up a business.

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Alright we're back.

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,840
So the guy wanted to open up a business but his friend explained that it's not so easy

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,600
and gave a lot of interesting words and phrases there.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
He did.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
He seemed a little naive.

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,160
Like he didn't really know how much work is involved in opening a business.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Exactly.

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,000
So I think we should take a look at some of the words used on Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Language Takeaway

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,000
The first word is the heart and soul of the process before you open a business.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,480
It's the business plan.

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,600
Alright so the business plan.

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,360
As you said it's a noun and it's basically a document that explains what's going on in

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
the business.

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Exactly.

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,320
It's a paper that you write about the business that you want to open and it's a plan.

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,680
So that's what the name says.

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,000
You have to tell what you will do, how much money you will spend, how much money you will

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,620
need.

69
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,760
Because if you're asking people for money, they want to know where the money will be

70
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,640
spent if it's going to be spent on wise decisions.

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Exactly.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,560
And as you mentioned, you show this business plan maybe to a bank but also maybe to an

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
investor.

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
That's right.

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
So investor is our next word.

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,360
It's another noun but this noun is a person.

77
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,560
A person is an investor.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,440
If he or she gives money to someone else and expects more money to come back.

79
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Right.

80
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,880
So a person that's starting out a business maybe has enough money himself to open up

81
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,020
a business but sometimes you need extra money so you look for investors.

82
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,920
People who are interested in giving you money.

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,240
For example, I have a cupcake company.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,640
I want to sell cupcakes to people and I need a thousand dollars.

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
So Marco, do you want to be an investor?

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Do you want to invest some money?

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes.

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
For sure.

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
A cupcake company.

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
That sounds great.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,920
I know but what happens if I don't sell cupcakes?

92
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,360
That's a problem for you because you have made a risky investment.

93
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
That's right.

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,480
So that's what happens with investors.

95
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,400
But now if you want to attract the attention of your investors with your business plan,

96
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,640
I think part of the most important aspects of this plan is the executive summary.

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,800
A summary is usually an outline of the important points of a paper or a document.

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,160
So in this case I could say, Catherine's cupcake company will sell delicious cupcakes of 10

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,320
different flavors to the market of 5 year olds, 55 year olds.

100
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
People will love them.

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,600
She has a great secret recipe and she plans to triple her investments by next year.

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Right.

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
That's exactly it.

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,260
So if an investor reads the executive summary, which shouldn't be more than two pages long,

105
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,280
you can pretty much get the idea of what the business is about.

106
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,280
So if you want more details, you have to read the rest of the business plan.

107
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,240
But mainly with the executive summary, you can more or less know what it's all about.

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Exactly.

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
So a summary, like I said, is something that should be short and it should give you all

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
of the most important information about something.

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Exactly.

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,120
And while they were talking more in depth about analyzing things and doing some research,

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
and among those things, the girl mentioned the socio-economic factors.

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Okay, when I said we're going to sell cupcakes from my company to people between the ages

115
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,880
of 5 and 55, we need to analyze, we need to look at their socio-economic factors.

116
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
Socio comes from the word social.

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,440
It means where in society they are, they're upper class, middle class or lower class.

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
Economic means how much money do they make?

119
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,720
Do they make $10,000 a year or $100,000 a year?

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,840
And so the kind of people we want to sell my cupcakes to will change according to their

121
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
socio-economic factors.

122
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
That's right.

123
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,080
So as you mentioned, socio comes from the word social or from society.

124
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,800
So you're analyzing these factors from society.

125
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,600
And well, part of these factors is the GDP per capita.

126
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,960
So we have two different words there.

127
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,160
An acronym, GDP.

128
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,280
GDP, gross domestic product.

129
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,600
That might seem confusing because gross means different things at different times.

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,640
But in this case, domestic means our country.

131
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,840
So within a country, all of the products added up together.

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Right.

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,480
And gross is basically that.

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Just all the products added up together without taking into consideration any other things.

135
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,240
So the GDP is basically all the goods and services produced in a country within a given

136
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
time.

137
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
And what about per capita though?

138
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,320
So per capita comes from Latin.

139
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,680
Per means four or each.

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,920
And capita is a head.

141
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,040
So this is per person.

142
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,880
So GDP per capita means how much, how many goods and services are made divided by the

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,160
number of people in that place.

144
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Exactly.

145
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,240
So you probably have these indicators in your country or your own language as well.

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
But that's basically it.

147
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,760
And the acronym is gross domestic product.

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,120
And just to explain a little bit, if you see this in Wikipedia or in an encyclopedia,

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,720
normally a very low GDP per capita is $500, American dollars.

150
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,800
And a high one would be $35,000.

151
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
$35,000, yeah.

152
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,600
And that's usually per year, right?

153
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,240
Because that's usually how it's taken into consideration.

154
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
The time is a year.

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
All right.

156
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,320
So those are the words that we have for you on language takeaway.

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,840
Now why don't we move on to a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

158
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Fluency Builder.

159
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Okay.

160
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,160
So this is important.

161
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,560
First phrase, Marco, has to do with our last first phrase.

162
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
We had a business plan.

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
So what do you do?

164
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
You write up a business plan.

165
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Right.

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,000
And that's a common way of saying to write or to create, to work on a business plan,

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to write up.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So it's something that we say that's very colloquial.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,040
Something that is very spoken.

171
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,200
And I can't explain why we say it, but you'll sound very fluent if you say, I'm going to

172
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,320
write up a business plan.

173
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,080
Or why don't you write up a business plan?

174
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Right.

175
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,120
So it would be correct to say, I'm going to write a business plan or I have to write a

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
business plan.

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,440
But if you use this phrase, I'm going to write up a business plan, it's more fluent, right?

178
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
It's just more native-like.

179
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Exactly.

180
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
All right.

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,720
And our next phrase is a return on investment.

182
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Okay.

183
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,760
So early we talked about investors.

184
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,280
The money that they invest is called an investment.

185
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Okay.

186
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,320
These words are all very closely related.

187
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:54,360
And when Marco decided to give money to my cupcake business, he expects the money to

188
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,840
come back and he expects more actually to come back than what he put in.

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,120
So that's called a return on investment.

190
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
The money that's the difference.

191
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,840
So if he gives me a thousand dollars and I give him back $1,500 in a year, he made $500.

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
That's amazing.

193
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,920
So that means it's a good return on his investment.

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Right.

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,080
So that's the term that we use, a return on investment.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,760
So you don't say to return on investment, you see a return on investment.

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Exactly.

198
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
It's a thing, it's a number, it's a quantity.

199
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,480
It's something you can count.

200
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Right.

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,240
And well, in the end, after seeing that this business plan is not so easy, the guy said,

202
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
you know what?

203
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm not going to quit my job and just save myself the hassle.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What's a hassle?

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The hassle.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,440
That's an interesting word.

207
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,720
So if I'm going to save myself the hassle, a hassle is like the problem or the hard work

208
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
that it involves.

209
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a lot of trouble.

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
A lot of trouble.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,800
So I was going to cook some dinner tonight, but I'm going to save myself the hassle of

212
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,840
going to the grocery store and buying it and cooking it by just ordering food.

213
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Right.

214
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
So that's a good example.

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,680
Instead of doing all the work of cooking, you just save yourself the hassle, pick up

216
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
the phone and get food delivered to your house.

217
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Right.

218
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,880
So you can change here, you can say save myself, save yourself, save his self.

219
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,440
So you change that pronoun.

220
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
The pronoun.

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Exactly.

222
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,840
So you can save yourself the hassle or I'm just going to save myself the hassle.

223
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Okay.

224
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,880
So that's about it for fluency builder.

225
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,240
Let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and we'll be back in a minute to talk

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:32,840
about business.

227
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,920
I've had it.

228
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

229
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,160
So what are you going to do?

230
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
Just quit?

231
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,640
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

232
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,800
I've decided to create my own company.

233
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,520
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself.

234
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,760
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

235
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,480
Well, no, it can't be that hard.

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,760
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business.

237
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,320
How are you going to do things?

238
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
And that's it, right?

239
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
You couldn't be more wrong.

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,480
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary, which highlights the

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,280
idea of the business in two pages or less.

242
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,000
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,960
it has, history, etc.

244
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
Well, that seems easy enough.

245
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,440
Wait, there's more.

246
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're

247
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,080
different from competitors.

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,880
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

249
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables.

250
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,320
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children

251
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,520
on average the population has.

252
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,680
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation

253
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,920
stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

254
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
Geez, is that all?

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Almost.

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,320
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

257
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,960
Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits.

258
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,040
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

259
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,080
I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start

260
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:15,600
up a business.

261
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,000
So it was pretty interesting that he wanted to quit his job and just, you know, set up

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
a business.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,040
But actually, many people say that business plans are unnecessary.

264
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Really?

265
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,360
Do these people have lots of money and they don't need investors?

266
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
I think the problem is that there are many books out there that give you clear examples

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,940
of companies, Fortune 500 companies, that started out without a business plan.

268
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,800
So I think many people take this as a rule.

269
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
A rule.

270
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,400
Like, well, they didn't need one or it's not really necessary or why should I write up

271
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
a business plan?

272
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,840
Well, I'm not an entrepreneur and I'm not a business person, but my feeling is that

273
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,040
a business plan is as much for investors as it is for yourself.

274
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,520
It helps you clarify your goals.

275
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,840
It helps you explain your objectives to your future colleagues.

276
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,320
And I think it's just a really good way to map out the first year of a business because

277
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,160
it tends to, a lot of businesses fail in that first year.

278
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,040
So I think this is a really important step.

279
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,200
Yeah, exactly.

280
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
So it's very interesting.

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,640
We've talked a little bit about business here, but we would like to know your ideas or your
