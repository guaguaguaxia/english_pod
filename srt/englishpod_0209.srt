00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,120
And my name is Kathryn.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,680
And today we're talking about office stuff, things in your office.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,680
That's right.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,640
We are talking about secrets in the office or maybe specific little things that people

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,200
talk about behind other people's back.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,400
Okay, bad things then.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,560
So this is an elementary level lesson.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,360
Before we get going though, let's take a look at a phrase in today's vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,560
All right.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,000
So the phrase for today is actually the same as the title for this lesson and that's office

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
gossip.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,160
Okay, you all know what an office is.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,660
What is gossip?

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:52,740
So to gossip means to talk about other people secretly or behind their backs or maybe talk

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,680
about other people's problems or private things.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,680
So oh my God, did you hear?

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
John is totally going to break up with her.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,720
So you're talking about people without them knowing.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Right.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,960
So you're talking about their private things, their relationships, maybe you're even maybe

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,480
criticizing them.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
That's right.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,840
So office gossip is talking about people in your office without them knowing.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,760
So saying bad things about them.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Right.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,160
So without any more delay, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time.

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,320
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,920
No, go on.

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
Tell me.

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,560
What's the latest office gossip?

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:49,960
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
No way.

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,400
But she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
She's so two faced.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
You can't believe anything she says.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
Oh, hi, Paula.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
How are you?

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
I've got some good news.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm getting a promotion.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Congratulations.

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Yes, you're the best.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
All right, we're back.

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,600
So we have four key words that we want to look at from this gossip dialogue.

49
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,120
So why don't we take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,840
Okay, the first word is rumor.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,640
Rumor.

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,000
Now this is an interesting word about gossip.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah, a rumor.

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,320
So a rumor is a story that might or might not be true.

56
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Right.

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,760
Okay, so I heard a rumor that they broke up yesterday.

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,080
Okay, so you're not sure if they broke up or no one has told you for a fact.

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,400
No, it means I probably heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who heard

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,240
it from someone else who doesn't really know.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Right.

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,920
So rumors are maybe guesses about people and you don't know if they're true.

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
You see this a lot with famous people, movie stars.

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,760
They always talk about rumors that maybe they got married in secret or something.

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Exactly.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,880
There's a rumor that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are breaking up.

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Right.

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Okay, so we don't know if it's true.

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Rumor.

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
That's a rumor.

71
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,200
So now the rumor that they heard was that this girl Paula is getting a promotion.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
Promotion.

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,560
This is an important office word.

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,080
This means to be offered a better job in your company.

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,200
That means to move up.

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
To move up.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Right.

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Alright, so this is a noun.

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,920
You get a promotion, right?

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,400
Yes, I got a promotion last year which also meant I got more money.

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,540
Okay, awesome.

82
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
So that is a promotion.

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,880
Now when they were talking about the promotion, the girl said, I can't believe, the guy said,

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,600
and Eric said, I can't believe she's getting a promotion.

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
She's so two-faced.

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,280
Two-faced.

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,920
So think about what this means.

88
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,080
To have two faces.

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,080
To be two-faced means to have two different sides to your personality.

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,080
A good one and a bad one.

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,840
So like, I can be very nice to Marco.

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Marco, wow, you look so good today.

93
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
You're such a nice guy.

94
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
You're such a hard worker.

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,560
And then, oh my God, Marco's such an idiot.

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,160
He's like never working and he's always on the phone.

97
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Oh, hi Marco.

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
How are you doing?

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
That is two-faced.

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
That's very good.

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,440
Alright, so two-faced means to have two different sides to your personality.

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,080
Now it's interesting the way that you use this word, you say two-faced, right?

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,920
So you have to add the E-D at the end.

104
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
You can't say he is two-faced.

105
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
No.

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Or he has two-face.

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,280
No, it's an adjective.

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
So he's two-faced.

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Okay.

110
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
She is two-faced.

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Okay, two-faced.

112
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440
I don't like people who are two-faced.

113
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480
Okay, very good.

114
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,080
And we have one final word and it's actually a verb when people talk like this.

115
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
When they're talking like this.

116
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
So they're talking quietly.

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Very quietly.

118
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
To whisper.

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
To whisper.

120
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Okay.

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
So what are you whispering about?

122
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Uh-oh.

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,480
So usually when people are whispering, they're talking about a rumor.

124
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Right.

125
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Or they're talking in secret.

126
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,080
You don't want somebody else to hear you.

127
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Right.

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,080
So when you want to be very quiet, like at the movie theater, you whisper.

129
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Whisper.

130
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Okay.

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
So those are four words for language takeaway.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to take a look at

133
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,480
a couple of phrases.

134
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Psst.

135
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Psst.

136
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

137
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
No.

138
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Go on, tell me.

139
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
What's the latest office gossip?

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

141
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,840
No way.

142
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,080
But she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

143
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
She's so two-faced.

144
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
You can't believe anything she says.

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

146
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
Oh, hi Paula.

147
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
How are you?

148
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,320
I've got some good news.

149
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm getting a promotion.

150
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Congratulations.

151
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,960
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

152
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,640
Yes, you're the best.

153
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,840
All right, we're back.

154
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,480
So now we have three key phrases from this great dialogue on Fluency Builder.

155
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,600
Fluency Builder.

156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,800
So this first one is the beginning to any great rumor.

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,640
We say, have you heard?

158
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Right.

159
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,920
So, have you heard?

160
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,040
Have you heard that she got a promotion?

161
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Right.

162
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,880
It's kind of, you're not really asking, right?

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,360
Although it is a question, have you heard?

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,320
But you're not really expecting an answer.

165
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,280
This means I'm going to tell you some gossip.

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Right.

167
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,520
Have you heard?

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,280
Because maybe I did, maybe I didn't, but I'm still going to say it.

169
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm still going to say it anyway.

170
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,520
So usually you can say, what?

171
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,280
Or in this case, Eric goes, no, go on, tell me.

172
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,920
What's the latest office gossip?

173
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,960
So obviously he knows it's going to be gossip.

174
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Right.

175
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Have you heard?

176
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
All right.

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
And so the next thing Pam says is, well, you didn't hear this from me.

178
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Okay.

179
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
What does this mean?

180
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
This is typical.

181
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,500
This is a way of saying, okay, don't tell anyone that I told you.

182
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,280
So you can tell people, but just don't tell them that I said that this happened because

183
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,040
Pam doesn't want to get in trouble.

184
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Right.

185
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,200
She doesn't want anyone to know that she was giving out rumors.

186
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,000
So that's why she's starting out with, well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
is, okay.

188
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,760
So you can, so this is a way of saying, all right, don't tell anyone that I told you.

189
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,380
You didn't hear this from me.

190
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,760
And also you can go, you can say, but the rumor is, or you can say, but rumor has it.

191
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Oh, rumor has it that Paula is getting a promotion.

192
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,240
So you can go both ways.

193
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,360
And now he exclaimed something that's very strange.

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,840
If you just look at it from these two words, no way.

195
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
No way.

196
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
What is no way?

197
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,600
Well, in this context, no way means really?

198
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Wow.

199
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Right.

200
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm surprised.

201
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
So it's a way to express surprise.

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's right.

203
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,440
But be careful because there's another meaning to this phrase.

204
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,640
For example, Marco, could you help me out and get the groceries from the car?

205
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
No way.

206
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Huh?

207
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Okay.

208
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
That means no.

209
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Okay.

210
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Okay.

211
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
No way.

212
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
That means no.

213
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,920
But also if you say it like, no way, you're saying, wow, that's so interesting.

214
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,680
So it can be an expression of surprise or it can be a way of saying no, very firmly,

215
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
no way.

216
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Exactly.

217
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
All right.

218
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
So three great phrases there.

219
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,280
Very interesting dialogue about gossip, very common in the office environment.

220
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,520
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit.

221
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Psst.

222
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,920
Psst.

223
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,360
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

224
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
No.

225
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,880
Go on.

226
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Tell me.

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
What's the latest office gossip?

228
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

229
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
No way.

230
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,120
But she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

231
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
She's so two-faced.

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,920
You can't believe anything she says.

233
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Hey guys.

234
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,480
What are you two whispering about?

235
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,640
Oh, hi Paula.

236
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
How are you?

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
I've got some good news.

238
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
I'm getting a promotion.

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Congratulations.

240
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,760
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

241
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Yes.

242
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
You're the best.

243
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Okay.

244
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
We're back.

245
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:52,240
So office gossip is generally, well, it's common.

246
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,800
It happens in every office, but I think that it's good to avoid too much gossip because

247
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,240
sometimes people's feelings can get hurt.

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Yeah.

249
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,420
It's actually very interesting because usually the bigger the company is, I think more gossip

250
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,720
starts to spread because there are departments.

251
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,680
So you got the marketing department, the finance department.

252
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,480
So you're like, oh, Kathy from finance, she slept with Tom from marketing and stuff like

253
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
that.

254
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Then you have the gossip about the bosses.

255
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Right.

256
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Did you see?

257
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,800
He totally left for the weekend, but his wife was at home.

258
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,640
And also one of the situations where a lot of rumors and office gossip starts to come

259
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,840
up is office parties or the office Christmas parties where people maybe are drinking or

260
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,560
something happens and a lot of rumors start to spread.

261
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
And they're more relaxed than usual.

262
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
They do things they wouldn't normally do.

263
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Absolutely.

264
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,580
So maybe we could open this up to you.

265
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,560
Is there a common rumor or office gossip that you hear in your office?

266
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,480
Or is there that one secretary or guy that's always spreading rumors and gossiping?

267
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
And don't use any real names.

268
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,920
You can just tell us general stories.

269
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,040
But that's about it for us here today at EnglishPod.
