00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,800
We have an upper intermediate lesson for you today.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,220
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,220
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,660
So today we're talking about something that everyone who's ever lived away from home has

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,660
felt before.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,660
Right.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,980
And that's the word we're going to preview today.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,980
The word is homesick.

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,980
All right.

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,800
So let's take a look at that in today's language preview.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
All right.

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
So homesick.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,760
If you feel homesick or you are homesick.

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, yeah, you could say I'm homesick right now.

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,320
Or are you feeling homesick?

18
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,960
So it's a word that means I miss my home.

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,360
I miss my family.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm far away or I haven't seen my family in a long time.

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,440
And for some reason you just feel sad.

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Okay.

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,000
So it's a feeling.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,160
You feel a little bit depressed.

25
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,760
You feel sad because you're homesick.

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Right.

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Okay.

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,040
So this is what's happening today in our dialogue.

29
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,440
So let's listen to it for the first time.

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Tom, how are you?

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,360
Hey, we missed you at the party last night.

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Are you okay?

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
I didn't really feel like going out.

35
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,400
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Come on.

37
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
We've been through this already.

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,720
Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agree that you're

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,840
going to try and deal with it.

40
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,000
I was.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,040
It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to go home because I can't

42
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,800
afford the airfare.

43
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around

44
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
my family.

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,240
Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,240
When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of

47
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
home.

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy.

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,960
And before I knew it, I was used to it.

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,520
I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,880
Okay, how does this sound?

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,840
Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,200
I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there.

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,960
You know, I could really go for that.

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,640
You don't mind being my wingman for tonight?

56
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Not at all.

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,880
It'll be fun.

58
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,880
It will be like a boys' night out.

59
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,400
Well, kind of.

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Great.

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
I must warn you, though.

62
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,040
Whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge.

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,080
Trust me, it's not a pretty picture.

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,320
All righty, we're back.

65
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,500
So yeah, I guess he's very homesick.

66
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Very homesick.

67
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,040
And his friend is really worried.

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Yeah.

69
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
But actually, I think this is common, right?

70
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,720
To be homesick during the holidays, like Christmas, for example.

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,980
Oh, man, it's the worst during the holidays because you think of all the traditions and

72
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,900
all the things that you normally do at home and you're not doing them.

73
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,880
So this is something we're going to talk more about a little bit later on.

74
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,640
But let's take a look at some of the language that was used in Language Takeaway.

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,580
Language Takeaway.

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,620
This first one is key, right?

77
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,240
So when you move away from home or when you move to a new place, you have a period of

78
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,280
adjustment.

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,340
So adjustment is kind of finding the right balance or doing something so that you can

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
kind of feel comfortable.

81
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,740
OK, so you have to adjust to your new life, life away from home.

82
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
Or your new environment.

83
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,080
So many times people say, wow, moving to China must be a big adjustment.

84
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,560
So it means there's so many differences that it must take a long time to feel comfortable

85
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
again.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
OK.

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
All right.

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
So that's adjustment.

89
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
What else do we have?

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,960
Well, we've got this next phrase that's really important, I think, but often gets overlooked.

91
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,960
We say the comforts of home, right?

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Comforts of home.

93
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,680
So comfort's pretty easy, right?

94
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Feeling comfortable.

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,840
So you have comfort.

96
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,220
But the comforts of home are things that are different with every person.

97
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,440
But those are things that you have at your home or your childhood home or your parents'

98
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,120
home that make you feel good and feel happy.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,240
So they're not only physical things or objects, right?

100
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,120
They can be like your mom's cooking or maybe even just spending time with your family.

101
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Right, or reading the newspaper with your dad or things that you're used to that you

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,760
don't have anymore.

103
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,160
And so those are the comforts of home.

104
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
I could say, Marco, do you miss the comforts of home in Ecuador?

105
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,080
I mean, do you have anything that's really...

106
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Of course, of course.

107
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,080
I think one of the main things is actually not living in the city because I used to live

108
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,520
in the valley a little bit further away and kind of almost countryside.

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,280
So that's one of the comforts of home that I miss.

110
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,080
Oh, you're making me nostalgic and I've never even been.

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
All right.

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,720
Well, this is our next word, actually.

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Right, nostalgic.

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Nostalgic.

115
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
It's a feeling.

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm feeling nostalgic or he's just really nostalgic.

117
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,440
And so to be nostalgic is to kind of think about a time before or think positively about

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,140
something that you experienced before.

119
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,300
So it's not usually a bad thing.

120
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,960
It's never a bad thing.

121
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,120
Nostalgia is a good, warm, fond memory of something.

122
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
Of something from your past.

123
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,440
So you start thinking of something from your past that maybe brings nice, warm feelings,

124
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,400
maybe a little bit sad because you miss those times, but it's usually thinking about the

125
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
past.

126
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Right.

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
So I have nostalgia for my childhood.

128
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,280
I loved, you know, summers in Chicago and it was hot and the kids would play in the

129
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,200
sprinkler and I had my dog and you know, it's a happy feeling.

130
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Right.

131
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,840
So nostalgia would be the noun and nostalgic would be the adjective.

132
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Exactly.

133
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
All right.

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,600
And our last word for today on Language Takeaway is bummed out.

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Bummed out.

136
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm bummed out.

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
We've got another feeling here.

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
So we're all full of feelings today.

139
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,240
Bummed out is a sad feeling.

140
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,840
So to be bummed is kind of slang and it means to be sad.

141
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Okay.

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Or disappointed.

143
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Disappointed.

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,360
So you come into the office, Marco, and you look a little tired.

145
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
I said, are you okay?

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
Are you bummed out about something?

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
I can say, yeah, I lost my wallet last night so I'm really bummed out.

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
Or something like that.

149
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,720
So yeah, you feel bummed out when something bad or sad happens.

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Right.

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
All right.

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,240
So let's move on now to a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

153
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Fluency Builder.

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
All right.

155
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,880
This first one is something that you often say to old friends or family.

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,920
You know, when you're friends with someone, they go through periods of happiness and sadness.

157
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,960
And so when someone's going through a down period again, you say, oh, we've been through

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
this already.

159
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,800
We've been through this already.

160
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,240
Or you know, when you're giving someone advice and they never take your advice, you say,

161
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,880
listen, we've been through this already.

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,120
You should know by now that I and then, you know, whatever the advice is.

163
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,520
So this has happened before or we have experienced this before or we already solved this problem

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
or situation.

165
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Right.

166
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,600
You could imagine two bank robbers who are going over their plan for the 10th time and

167
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,760
then one says to the other, hey, we've been through this already.

168
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,840
You should know the plan by now.

169
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
Exactly.

170
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
All right.

171
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
So we've been through this already.

172
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,840
They were talking about the adjustments and everything.

173
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,160
And then what other phrase did they use?

174
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,120
Well, the next couple of phrases have to do with the friend's suggestions because she

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,560
has a lot of ideas to cheer her friend up, the depressed one.

176
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,880
And the first thing she says is, hey, let's hit the dance club.

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280
Okay, let's hit the dance club or let's hit the dance floor tonight.

178
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Right.

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,040
So hit in this case doesn't mean like hit.

180
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,320
It doesn't mean you're punching someone.

181
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,240
It means to go to or to do.

182
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
All right.

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,320
So we can say, let's go to the dance club tonight.

184
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Let's hit the dance club.

185
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Exactly.

186
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
It doesn't have to be a dance club.

187
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,720
But let's hit that concert tonight.

188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
I really want to go there.

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Okay.

190
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,320
So you can hit pretty much any place, right?

191
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Exactly.

192
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,840
And this is a very kind of spoken language.

193
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,800
So you wouldn't say this in your essays, but it's a good way to talk about plans with

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
friends.

195
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
All right.

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,560
And our next word actually is kind of interesting because it's very colloquial and it's a wingman.

197
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,360
I can be your wingman tonight.

198
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,700
So wingman, you have to think about wing meaning side, not like a bird's wing.

199
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:58,400
So a wing means side and a wingman is a guy who will go with you to a bar or a club to

200
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,520
kind of help you find a date or a girl or someone to talk to.

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Okay.

202
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,700
So this person, this wingman usually keeps you company and helps you decide maybe what

203
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,800
girl to talk to or maybe even introduces you to someone at a club or at a restaurant or

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
bar or whatever.

205
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
And, you know, the key is that people don't like to go alone to bars, right?

206
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Because you feel sad and then you look weird because you're all alone.

207
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,360
And the same is true for girls.

208
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,440
And so if a guy wants to go to a bar and he sees two girls, well, he has to have a friend

209
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,080
to talk to the other girl.

210
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,800
So wingman also helps in that sense.

211
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,560
He helps balance things.

212
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
All right.

213
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
So there's a whole science behind the wingman.

214
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,280
I'm sure if you look it up on Wikipedia, you'll find 10 pages of information.

215
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
All right.

216
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,320
So since they are going out tonight, they said it could be boys night out.

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Okay.

218
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,680
And this is another phrase you hear all the time, especially among young people, boys

219
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,620
night out and girls night out.

220
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,880
And so, you know, sometimes you spend a lot of time with your husband or your wife or

221
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,080
your boyfriend or girlfriend and you just want to have some time with your friends.

222
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,680
And so you call this girls night for me, girls night out.

223
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
You just go out and you do girl things.

224
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,840
Guys night out, you do other things.

225
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,300
And so in this case, it's girls only or guys only.

226
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,600
Boys night out is only guys.

227
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Exactly.

228
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,680
And that's why this is funny because it's the girl who says, hey, let's have boys night

229
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
out.

230
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
And she's not really a boy.

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
All right.

232
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Great.

233
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,520
And well, he agreed to go out and everything, but he warned her about him going on a drinking

234
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
binge.

235
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Okay.

236
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Now, this is important.

237
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,400
A lot of people who are depressed or sad when they drink, they drink a lot.

238
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,760
And so binge means to do something in excess, to do it too much.

239
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Okay.

240
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,440
So a drinking binge would be drinking alcohol in excess, too much.

241
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Too much.

242
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
So getting drunk right away.

243
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,520
And it's not healthy and we do not condone it.

244
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Right.

245
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Exactly.

246
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Very good.

247
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,560
So we're going to stop with the phrases in this dialogue today.

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,520
I think we should listen to it one more time and we'll be right back.

249
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Tom, how are you?

250
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
Hey, we missed you at the party last night.

251
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Are you okay?

252
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
I don't know.

253
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,760
I didn't really feel like going out.

254
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,360
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.

255
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Come on.

256
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
We've been through this already.

257
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,920
Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here.

258
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
But we agree that you're going to try and deal with it.

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,960
I was.

260
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,000
It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to go home because I can't

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,720
afford the airfare.

262
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,460
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around

263
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
my family.

264
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,160
Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays.

265
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,160
When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of

266
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
home.

267
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,600
I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy.

268
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,880
And before I knew it, I was used to it.

269
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,240
I see what you mean.

270
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,520
But I'm still bummed out.

271
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,800
Okay, how does this sound?

272
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,760
Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

273
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,120
I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there.

274
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,880
You know, I could really go for that.

275
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,560
You don't mind being my wingman for tonight?

276
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Not at all.

277
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,800
It'll be fun.

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,760
It will be like a boys' night out.

279
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,320
Well, kind of.

280
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Great.

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,000
I must warn you, though, whatever happens, don't let me go on a drinking binge.

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,440
Trust me, it's not a pretty picture.

283
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,000
All right, we're back.

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,840
So speaking of homesick and holidays, do you actually get very depressed or homesick during

285
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Christmas?

286
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
I do.

287
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Well, my family has a lot of Christmas traditions that are just really kind of wonderful and

288
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,960
we do them every single year.

289
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,000
And so the first time I spent Christmas away, I was living in Italy and it was kind of similar.

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,800
But then the second time was when I was living in China.

291
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,440
And China was just not the same.

292
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,160
No oven, so no Christmas cookies.

293
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,000
And no granny who, you know, pours vodka and eats meatballs.

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,760
And like my mom not running around the kitchen.

295
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,360
You feel lonely and then all of a sudden you get a phone call.

296
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,820
And it's the entire family and they're all together eating, having an amazing Christmas

297
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,000
and they think it's going to help you feel less homesick, but it makes you feel more

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
homesick.

299
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,440
So you definitely have nostalgia for those days during the holidays.

300
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,920
But what about you?

301
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,680
I rarely get homesick, but yeah, sometimes during Christmas or New Year's, New Year's

302
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
we usually have more unique traditions in Ecuador.

303
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,000
So it's very fun.

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,520
The family gets together, we dance, we eat.

305
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,200
So but yeah, I've been away from home so long that I rarely get homesick anymore.

306
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
But it's great to go back and spend time with the family.

307
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,560
So after my visit to Ecuador, then I might get homesick for a little while, but then

308
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
it goes away.

309
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Yeah.

310
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Well, you guys should tell us.

311
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Do you ever feel homesick?

312
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
And if you do, what do you feel homesick about?

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
What do you miss?

314
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
Maybe mom's cooking, maybe family, maybe the comforts of home.

315
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
Yeah, so we're curious to hear your answers.

316
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,840
We have a website, EnglishPod.com.

317
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,120
You can of course also leave us questions.

318
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,640
We're happy to answer those.

319
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
And until next time, everyone.

320
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,320
Bye bye.
