00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,440
And my name is Katherine.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,160
And today we're talking about being on the road.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, we're going to be on the road, but we're going to encounter a little bit of a car problems.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My favorite kind.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I think it's happened to everyone.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're on the road or maybe you're coming back from work, you get a flat tire or something

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
happens to your car, right?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,440
And it's always when you're in a rush.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,200
And most of the time it's raining.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
It's snowing.

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,760
So all of the circumstances definitely, well, they don't help.

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Let's just say.

18
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
All right.

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,760
So before we listen to this dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words in today's

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,560
vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,640
All right.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,960
So we're going to take a look at two words.

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
They're kind of strange.

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,560
I don't know, kind of difficult to understand.

26
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,040
So that's what we're going to explain them.

27
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,720
The first one is spew, to spew.

28
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,880
It's a verb, okay?

29
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
To spew.

30
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, what can spew?

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Volcano can spew.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Exactly.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,240
An engine can spew.

34
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
A person can spew.

35
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Yeah.

36
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
That's not very nice.

37
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
No.

38
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,300
So basically it's to like expel or to shoot out from your mouth or something liquid.

39
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,060
So in the case of a person, right?

40
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,800
So if a person spews, it means a person throws up, but it's usually very forceful.

41
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
All right.

42
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
It's very messy.

43
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
A volcano can spew lava.

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Exactly.

45
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
So a volcano is spewing lava.

46
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,360
Now for the next word that we have, it's an informal way of saying that something is broken.

47
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,360
You could say it's busted.

48
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
It's busted.

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
My DVD player is busted.

50
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,240
Man, my phone is busted.

51
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,360
So it's an informal way, very popular, very common I would say, to describe that something

52
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
is not working.

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
I don't think many people actually say, well, it's broken or it's damaged.

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Yeah.

55
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,840
They're pretty much mixed I think, but you will definitely hear busted if you're talking

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
to native English speakers.

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Or even like, for example, your arm.

58
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,800
He's got a busted arm.

59
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Exactly.

60
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
So busted.

61
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
All right.

62
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

63
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's see what's going on with this car trouble and then we'll come back and explain some

64
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
things.

65
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Howdy.

66
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Nice car.

67
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
What seems to be the problem?

68
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
I don't know.

69
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
I don't know.

70
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
I don't know.

71
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
I don't know.

72
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
I don't know.

73
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
I don't know.

74
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
I don't know.

75
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
I don't know.

76
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
I don't know.

77
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
I don't know.

78
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
I don't know.

79
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
I don't know.

80
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
I don't know.

81
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,240
This stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

82
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,560
Luckily I managed to start it up and drive it here.

83
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,520
What do you think it is?

84
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Not sure yet.

85
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
How about you pop the hood and we could take a look?

86
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Mm.

87
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,040
It doesn't look good.

88
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
What do you mean?

89
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,820
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

90
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,480
It's brand new.

91
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,880
Well, missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

92
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,880
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted, and so is your transmission.

93
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,880
You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.

94
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Ugh. So, how long is this going to take? An hour?

95
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

96
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,880
We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump, and engine, and then put it back together again.

97
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,880
You're going to have to leave it here for at least, uh, two weeks.

98
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,880
What? How am I supposed to go to school? Or go shopping? This is not happening.

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,880
So if I were the mechanic, I would not be very happy to be dealing with someone like this girl.

100
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,880
I think it's, uh, well maybe it's a little bit stereotypical that we put it as a girl,

101
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,880
because guys and girls, so many people don't know anything about cars or mechanics.

102
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,880
And in the States, there's a lot of female mechanics too, so it's, you know, it's mixed.

103
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,880
But definitely it's something that happens all the time, and probably the mechanic will overcharge her as well,

104
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
because apparently she doesn't know what she's doing.

105
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,880
And that's one of the reasons we want to give you the vocabulary to deal with these situations.

106
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,880
So let's look at some of those car words in today's Language Takeaway.

107
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Alright, so we're going to take a look at very specific words related to cars and the engines and everything.

108
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
So let's start with the first one.

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Radiator.

110
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Radiator. Alright, so the radiator of the car.

111
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
So a radiator is something that you normally find in the front of the car near the engine.

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
It usually gets very, very hot, right?

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah.

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,880
So one of the big issues is radiators getting too hot because there's no way to cool them down.

115
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Mm-hmm. So if you live in a place that's very hot, the radiator keeps your engine cool because it has water in it.

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,880
So if it overheats, or maybe you didn't put enough water in there, then it'll start spewing steam like in this dialogue.

117
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,880
And if you have a problem with your radiator, you could actually do a lot of damage to your engine, which is why this is important.

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Exactly, and that's what happened in this dialogue.

119
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:03,880
So a radiator. Now, because the radiator wasn't working well, it overheated the engine, and he said they had some busted pistons.

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,880
So broken pistons. Pistons are important because they're kind of like valves that go up and down.

121
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Right. So inside your engine, you have mini explosions, and the pistons move up and down, and that's what actually moves your car.

122
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Right. And so pistons, in general, are things in mechanics. So like a trumpet has pistons, things that go up and down and that allow for the flow of air.

123
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Air or something like that. Very good. So that's a piston. And, well, another very common mechanic term is the transmission.

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Alright, so the transmission. What happens if your transmission dies? Can you still drive?

125
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
You basically can't move, or maybe you only have one gear or two gears.

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Alright, so think about transmission as coming from the word to transmit. That means to transfer.

127
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:56,880
So this is the part of the car that transfers energy or the power to actually move the car. So the transmission.

128
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,880
And we've got the mechanic who says, well, we've got to order you some spare parts. So first, let's look at the word spare.

129
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,880
What's another word for spare? Additional, maybe extra.

130
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Right. So spare means extra. Parts are, well, pieces. So he's talking about ordering a new transmission, new pistons, things to replace the broken things.

131
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Spare parts. So this is where you go to the mechanic to get some spare parts and get them installed.

132
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,880
You probably don't have many spare parts at home, right? You got a transmission lying around.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Well, yeah, so spare parts. And the last word that we're going to take a look at is a fuel pump.

134
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Okay, so a pump is, you could have a bike pump.

135
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
A water pump.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Water pump. So these are something, these are some things that we use very, very often.

137
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,880
But a fuel pump is something that allows gas, gasoline, to get into your engine.

138
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,880
So it's basically a device that pushes gasoline into the engine so you can start.

139
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,880
And that's the same thing with the water pump. It's a device that pushes water.

140
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Or an air pump is something that pushes air into your tires and your bicycle.

141
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Exactly. So a fuel pump, water pump, etc.

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Wow, I feel like we know a lot about cars.

143
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Yeah, apparently we do. See? Alright, so now that we've taken a look at all of these great words, let's move on to a couple of phrases in Fluency Builder.

144
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Alright, these are phrases that you hear sometimes when you're talking about electronics.

145
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,880
But in today's lesson, we're also talking about specific car phrases.

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,880
So you're going to hear these all the time at the mechanics.

147
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Right, and the first one is, the car suddenly died on me.

148
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Alright, to die on. So we keep these two words together, die on.

149
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Oh man, so while you were driving, your car died. It stopped moving.

150
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,880
So that means that it doesn't work anymore.

151
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,880
And it's not only for cars, right? You can say my MP3 player died on me today.

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Exactly, and what it means is, it's not like you left it and you forgot about it and you tried it again and it didn't work.

153
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,880
It means while you're using it, it dies. It doesn't work.

154
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,880
So I think this phrase is a good one to give some other examples. So let's listen.

155
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,880
So this next one is a phrase you hear, the first thing you hear maybe, when you tell someone you have a car problem.

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Right, you tell them to pop the hood.

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Or let's pop the hood. So this means let's open the front part of the car, the hood, to look at the engine, transmission, all those parts.

158
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Exactly. So you can say open the hood, but the most common one is pop the hood.

159
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,880
So the reason is because there is a little spring and you have to pull inside the car and it goes pop, and there's a little jump.

160
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah, exactly.

161
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
So it's literally popping.

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Right, or you can also say the trunk, right, the back part of the car.

163
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Hey, can you pop the trunk for me? I've got to put some stuff inside.

164
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Exactly, so pop the hood, pop the trunk.

165
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,880
And next we've got this girl actually, who's talking about her car because she just got this car.

166
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,880
So what's another way to say it's a new car?

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
It's brand new.

168
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Is that more new than new?

169
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
It's like newer, newer than new.

170
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Alright, so brand, you think about brands like Ford or Gucci, these are brands, but brand new means she maybe got it like today.

171
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
So it's brand new, it's very, very new.

172
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Did you see my brand new watch?

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Oh, it is nice, did you get it? Alright, so brand new.

174
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,880
And well, the last phrase that we have for you today is to take apart something.

175
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Alright, so this is very popular with young children, like they like to take things apart so they can find out how they work.

176
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,880
But to take apart means to take all the pieces and to pull them out.

177
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Yeah, I used to do that a lot when I was a kid.

178
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,880
I used to take apart any electronic device to kind of see how it works and then I would try to put it back together again.

179
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
That's why you're so smart.

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Well, it never really worked, it worked half the time.

181
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
So the problem is always putting them back together again, right?

182
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Exactly, so you can take it apart, but then you put it back together and there's always a screw missing or a screw that's extra or two or three parts.

183
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Not a good sign.

184
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Alright, so we've taken a look at a lot of great words and phrases, so let's listen to this dialogue for the last time.

185
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Not sure yet. How about you pop the hood and we can take a look?

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Mmm, doesn't look good.

187
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,880
What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It's brand new.

188
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Well, missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

189
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,880
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

190
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,880
You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.

191
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Ugh, so how long is this going to take? An hour?

192
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm afraid a bit more than that. We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine, and then put it back together again.

193
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,880
You're going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

194
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:55,880
What? How am I supposed to go to school? Or go shopping? This is not happening.

195
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Alright, so car trouble. Have you ever had any very serious car trouble or something weird happened to your car?

196
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Actually, the week before I decided to leave Chicago, I had this 1991 Honda Civic hatchback, so only two doors.

197
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,880
And I was driving home from work, I was on the highway, had the radio on, the windows open, and then doo doo doo doo, boom.

198
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
It died.

199
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,880
It died in the middle of the highway during rush hour. So that's when there's tons of cars and I didn't know what to do.

200
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,880
So I'm calling people and then all of a sudden I see someone tapping on my window. And there's cars everywhere.

201
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,880
And it's this guy. And he's like, listen, do you need a hand? I said yes.

202
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,880
So I put the car in neutral so that there's no brake. And he pushed it to a side road and gave me a ride home.

203
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
No way.

204
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,880
He was the coolest guy, he was so nice. And he was just there with his truck, he's a gardener, and just gave me a ride home.

205
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
It was super, super cool.

206
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Wow.

207
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,880
And so it turns out my engine died. No, the engine was new, it was the transmission, it was shot. It was totally broken.

208
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Wow.

209
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
But I was very lucky to have such a kind person.

210
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Yeah, that's a good story because usually people are too afraid or maybe a little bit reluctant to stop and see if you're okay or if you need a ride or something.

211
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Because you can't really trust people these days.

212
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,880
But it's good. Once I saw somebody on the side of the road that had a flat tire, it was two girls and they didn't know what to do.

213
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
So I was passing by. It was actually raining. And I was like, hey, do you guys need a hand?

214
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,880
And they're like, yeah, please. We can't locate my dad or whatever. So I was like, changing the tire, it's not a big deal, right?

215
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,880
And they wanted to tip me, they wanted to give me some money.

216
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Are you serious?

217
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,880
They're like, oh, please take this, you're so kind, your time, and you're all wet. And I'm like, no, no, don't worry about it.

218
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,880
That's a nice thing to do. If you know anything about cars, I mean, or if you can offer someone a lift.

219
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,880
I know it's not terribly safe to ride with strangers, but this guy totally helped me out.

220
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Nice. All right. Well, maybe you guys have some cool or maybe some interesting stories of what's happened with your cars or maybe you've helped somebody out.
