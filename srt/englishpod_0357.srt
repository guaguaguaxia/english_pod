00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,800
My name is Catherine and today, Marco, we're trying to make some plans.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,600
We're trying to go to a restaurant, correct?

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
That's right.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,320
We want to go to a restaurant tonight, but before we have to call them to make sure that

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,840
there is a space or room available for us.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
All right.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,120
So we're going to hear a conversation between a person at a restaurant who works there and

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,480
a person who would like to go to that restaurant.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Let's take a listen.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,960
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes, hello.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,680
I would like to make a reservation, please.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
Certainly, sir.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
For which day and time, please?

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Tonight at seven.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,280
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Very well.

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
And how many people will attend tonight?

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Four people.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,880
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,800
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,640
So let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,280
Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,660
So first up, Marco, we didn't hear the word restaurant in today's dialogue.

28
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,600
We heard a different noun.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
We heard this bistro.

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
That's right.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
The name of the restaurant is actually Bruno Bistro.

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,120
So this restaurant, the type of restaurant this is, it's actually a bistro.

33
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
That's right.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,920
It's a name like Marco or Catherine, but a bistro is actually a special kind of small

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
restaurant.

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
And I believe it comes from France, right?

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Right.

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
That's right.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,360
So it's kind of small and intimate, maybe some candles and lots of wine, but it's not

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,440
like a big restaurant.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
It's very romantic.

42
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Right, right.

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,800
Which usually, I found it means that it's more expensive for some reason.

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Because it's a bistro, it's automatically more expensive.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,440
I think maybe in America it's more expensive.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Who knows?

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Maybe in France it's the cheap option.

48
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
That's right.

49
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,160
Bistro is the kind of place we're at and we'd like to go, so it's probably a popular place.

50
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,960
We need to make a reservation.

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
That's right.

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
So as you see there, we have a verb there, to make.

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
We want to make a reservation.

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,640
So let's take a look at the noun, a reservation.

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Reservation.

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Reservation.

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,580
So this word means to ask the restaurant to hold your seats.

58
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,880
So you say, listen, I would like to come to your restaurant tonight.

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,640
I don't want to wait when I come, so I will call in advance.

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,040
I'll call early and ask them to save a table for us.

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
That's right.

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,880
So this is called making a reservation.

63
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
So it goes together.

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,800
You call to make a reservation or you want to make a reservation.

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
That's right.

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
So the verb is to make.

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,800
So I could say, for example, hey Marco, can you please make a reservation for dinner tonight?

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm afraid there might not be any tables left if we wait.

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay.

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Very good.

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,440
Now, we can use the verb reserve as well, right?

72
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
That's right.

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,520
So reservation is a noun.

74
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,360
To reserve is a verb.

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,120
So I can say, hey Marco, can you please reserve a table for dinner tonight?

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Okay.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,160
So we can say to make a reservation or reserve a table.

78
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,960
But you have to say reserve a table.

79
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,040
You can't say, I would like to reserve, please.

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,720
No, you have to reserve something.

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,560
So if I'm going to a concert, a music concert, I can say, I'd like to reserve two seats for

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
the concert.

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,360
But if I'm going to dinner, obviously we sit at a table.

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,600
So I'm going to reserve a table.

85
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
All right.

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Now, moving on to another verb, the waiter or the person in charge there asked us how

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,480
many people will attend dinner tonight.

88
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,400
So how many people will attend?

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
To attend.

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay.

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
This is another verb.

92
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,520
To attend means to be there or to come.

93
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
That's right.

94
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,720
So it's actually a nicer way of saying to come.

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,200
Instead of him saying, how many people will come tonight?

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,760
He says, how many people will attend?

97
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
All right.

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,360
So that's a question for the person making the reservation.

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,320
How many people total?

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,280
But it's like you say, very polite.

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,480
You could say, hey, Marco, how many people do you think will attend your birthday party

102
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
next week?

103
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
That's right.

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,240
So I can say, well, maybe 10 people will attend.

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,400
10 people will attend.

106
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,400
So attend, quite a simple verb, but just remember that it means to come or to be present at.

107
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
All right, great.

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,280
So let's take a look at our dialogue again, and then we'll be back in a bit with Fluency

109
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Builder.

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,800
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes, hello.

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,280
I would like to make a reservation, please.

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Certainly, sir.

114
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
For which day and time, please?

115
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,040
Tonight at 7.

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until 8.

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
In that case, 8 o'clock is fine.

118
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Very well.

119
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
And how many people will attend tonight?

120
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Four people.

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,360
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

122
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Mark.

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
All right, we've picked out three phrases for you.

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,200
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

125
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Fluency Builder.

126
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,560
All right, so the first phrase we have on Fluency Builder is actually a phrase you don't

127
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,240
want to hear when you're trying to make a reservation.

128
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,520
The person at the restaurant, the bistro, said, I'm sorry, we're fully booked until

129
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
8.

130
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
That's right.

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,640
So a place that is fully booked or maybe a flight that's fully booked means that it's

132
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
completely full.

133
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,520
There are no available seats or available spots or anything.

134
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
All the tables have been reserved.

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
All right, so this means that we have to change either the day or the time.

136
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
That's right.

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,160
It's fully booked.

138
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,000
But the nice thing is that after 8 o'clock is not fully booked.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,160
There are free tables after 8.

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
That's right.

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,640
And I actually went on to say an interesting phrase to start that sentence.

142
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,160
He said, in that case, 8 o'clock is fine.

143
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,580
In that case.

144
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,960
So in that case is a great phrase to use when you're having a conversation with someone

145
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,600
or a negotiation, because it's something that we say when the situation, okay, like reserving

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,160
a table is not exactly the way we hoped it would be.

147
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,360
So with today's dialogue, we wanted to book a table at 7 o'clock.

148
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
There was no table.

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,280
So in that case, in that situation, because it changed from what we thought, we had to

150
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,000
book a table at 8 instead.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,040
So it's usually a response to information that was given to you.

153
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,760
So they say, oh, I'm sorry, there are no tickets available for the zoo today, only for tomorrow.

154
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,360
In that case, why don't we go tomorrow?

155
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
That's right.

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,800
So I wanted to go today, but the situation changed or there's a problem.

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,960
In that case, let's change our plans.

158
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
That's right.

159
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,800
And lastly, the waiter asked, may I please know what name I should make the reservation

160
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,280
under?

161
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,360
What name I should make the reservation under?

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
All right.

163
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,760
Now to make a reservation, we already learned this phrase.

164
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,600
It means to reserve a table.

165
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Now to make a reservation under a person's name, this is quite different, right?

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,480
This means that we're going to save a table, reserve a table, but we have to provide a

167
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
name.

168
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,720
So if we say, okay, one table reserved for four, we don't know who.

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,680
So this is the name that you will give the waiter when you arrive at the restaurant.

170
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
That's right.

171
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,080
So that is your table basically, and that's your reservation.

172
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,800
So if you go to the restaurant, you say, hello, I have a reservation under the name of Mark.

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
That's right.

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,160
I have a reservation under the name Mark, or I have a reservation for Mark at eight

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
o'clock.

176
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,200
Now when they ask the question, they're going to say, what name should we make the reservation

177
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
under?

178
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,440
That's because, so just think about it as when they make the reservation, they have

179
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,200
this big book.

180
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,720
They write your name and underneath they write the time.

181
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,480
What name should we make the reservation under?

182
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
That's right.

183
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Okay.

184
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,040
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab and some really good phrases.

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:31,120
So let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

186
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,000
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, hello.

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,720
I would like to make a reservation, please.

189
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Certainly, sir.

190
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
For which day and time, please?

191
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Tonight at seven.

192
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,440
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.

193
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,280
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Very well.

195
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
And how many people will attend tonight?

196
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Four people.

197
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

198
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
Mark.

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,240
Language takeaway.

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,520
All right, we're back.

201
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,280
So making a reservation, now this is fairly easy.

202
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,360
This is basically what you're going to experience if you call any restaurant to make a reservation,

203
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
right?

204
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
That's right.

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,620
And it's really important to know how to respond because I know in other languages, sometimes

206
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,040
you reserve seats instead of tables.

207
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,360
And so in English, we reserve or we book a table.

208
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,800
Now sometimes you will call a place and you'll say, well, I'd like to make a reservation

209
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,960
and they will say, I'm sorry, we don't accept reservations.

210
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,320
Yes, this is actually a very frustrating situation, especially if a restaurant or bistro is very

211
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
popular.

212
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Right.

213
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Because if they don't accept reservations, we don't make reservations, that means that

214
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,600
you have to go to the restaurant and maybe wait in line for a table.

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
That's right.

216
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,400
That's called, I think, first come, first served, right?

217
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
That's right.

218
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
First come, first serve.

219
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,520
So that means that the first people to arrive at the restaurant are the first people to

220
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
get a table.

221
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
So it's smart to arrive early.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's right.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,520
So that's what happens.

224
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,200
Now there are certain restaurants where you can't make a reservation or different.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,260
We took a look at a bistro.

226
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,040
There's another one, like for example, very popular in the US, a diner.

227
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
A diner.

228
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,320
Now this is not a place you need to make a reservation for.

229
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,640
Normally a diner is a very casual place to eat.

230
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,240
You can go at nine o'clock in the morning for breakfast.

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
It's not very fancy at all.

232
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Right.

233
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,040
And it's open, I think, 24 hours usually.

234
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,560
Many of them are open 24 hours.

235
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,480
And that's why I say it's not a place you need to worry about a reservation because

236
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,720
they're usually popular at certain times, but like seven o'clock for breakfast or, you

237
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,680
know, 12 o'clock for lunch, but you can usually get a table.

238
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Right.

239
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
All right.

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,560
