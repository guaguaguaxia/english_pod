00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,560
Today, we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson and something that we all do.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,520
Right, talking to ourselves.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Talking to ourselves, right?

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,520
I think everyone does it.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,480
You think to yourself or you talk to yourself.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Yeah.

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,240
And we're going to be doing that today, but we're going to be looking at some specific

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
vocabulary.

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,400
Erika, why don't you tell us about that?

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,560
Well, unfortunately, we're going to be following a guy as he's in a really embarrassing situation

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,440
and we're going to hear him call himself some bad names in his mind.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,000
So he's a little bit nervous and he thinks he is not very smart, right?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's right.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,160
Okay, so before we start with this dialogue, there are a couple of words that we should

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,960
look at in vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,840
All right, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,040
And the first one is famished.

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Famished.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Famished.

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,360
Okay, so famished is an adjective.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,920
That's right, meaning very, very, very hungry.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,320
Very, very hungry.

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,960
Okay, so just very hungry, very easy.

29
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Yes.

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Famished.

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Now, what about our next one?

32
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Sexist.

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
Sexist.

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Sexist.

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,560
Another adjective to describe a person, right?

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Right.

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Or a thing, I guess.

38
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Like, yeah, an idea.

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
Okay, so a sexist person would be?

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,360
Somebody who judges people by their sex.

41
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Okay.

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
So like all women are stupid, for example.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Which is not true, of course.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, of course not.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No, of course not.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right?

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So sexist works both ways.

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
A woman can be sexist, a man could be sexist.

50
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Exactly.

51
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,920
Meaning the women thinks all men are stupid.

52
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Which is also not true.

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Yes.

54
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,280
Let's just be clear about that.

55
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,320
All right.

56
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,680
So now that we've taken a look at these two phrases, let's start with our dialogue and

57
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,960
we'll be back to talk about all the great words.

58
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,120
Miss, your salad.

59
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Mmm.

60
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Looks good.

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm positively famished.

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
And for you, sir.

63
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Thank you.

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Enjoy.

65
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Thank you.

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

67
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
I'm so lucky.

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

69
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I want to scream at the top of my lungs.

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
I'm the luckiest dude in the world.

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Oh, shut up.

72
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Don't be such a dumbass.

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
She's so hot.

74
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Wait, I can't say that.

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
That's sexist.

76
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
She's so hot.

77
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
She's making me sexist.

78
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Oh my God.

79
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm such a tool.

80
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Okay, get it together.

81
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
She's eating salad.

82
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
All right.

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
I have a salad.

84
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Oh, crap.

85
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Which fork do I use?

86
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Damn it.

87
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
She's going to think I'm a moron.

88
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
What the hell are all these forks for?

89
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Which one did she use?

90
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Okay, chill.

91
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
I'm going to use this one.

92
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
I'm going to use this one.

93
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm going to use this one.

94
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
I'm going to use this one.

95
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm going to use this one.

96
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm going to use this one.

97
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm going to use this one.

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm going to use this one.

99
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm going to use this one.

100
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Which one did she use?

101
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Okay, chill.

102
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Be cool.

103
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Be cool.

104
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Just take a fork.

105
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:25,760
Okay, embarrassing first date, huh?

106
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah, I mean I really do feel sorry for this guy.

107
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
Well, it happens to us.

108
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,120
Sometimes we are in the company of a very beautiful girl and we just get really nervous.

109
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,200
Alright, well, you know, psychologists call this negative self-talk.

110
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Really?

111
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,720
Yeah, this sort of calling yourself names and talking negatively about yourself.

112
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,600
But actually you can use some of this language to talk negatively about others.

113
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah.

114
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,480
So why don't we look now at this language in Language Takeaway.

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,280
Language Takeaway.

116
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,560
So on Language Takeaway today we have five words.

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Let's start with our first one.

118
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Dumbass.

119
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Dumbass.

120
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Dumbass.

121
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,840
Okay, now this isn't a very polite word I would say.

122
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
Definitely not polite.

123
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Okay, but what is a dumbass?

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,160
Well, it's obviously a dumb, stupid idiot.

125
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,200
Okay, so it's a person that is not very intelligent.

126
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,000
And our next word is also quite similar.

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Moron.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Moron.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Moron.

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A moron.

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,640
If a person is a dumbass or a person is a moron, what's the difference?

132
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,120
Well, basically a moron is someone who is not smart, who is very unintelligent.

133
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Okay.

134
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,560
So they don't know what one plus one is.

135
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Okay.

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
All right.

137
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,680
But a dumbass is a person who does stupid things.

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Okay.

139
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,880
So maybe a dumbass like you're planning a bank robbery and the dumbass forgets to bring

140
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
the gun.

141
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Okay.

142
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
That is a dumbass.

143
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
All right.

144
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,160
So maybe moron is a little bit less offensive and it's actually you'll find it in the dictionary,

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
right?

146
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Yeah.

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Whereas a dumbass I don't think you'll find it.

148
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Yeah, it's slang.

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
It's slang.

150
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Exactly.

151
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Now what about this next?

152
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
It's also a negative name you can call people.

153
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
A tool.

154
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Tool.

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,560
This is very strange because I don't know how a tool can be something negative towards

156
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
a person.

157
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Yeah.

158
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
But it actually means the opposite, right?

159
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,520
If a person is called a tool, it means they are useless, right?

160
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Yeah.

161
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,600
So if you ever call the tool, they're saying that you're useless.

162
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Exactly.

163
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
You're good for nothing.

164
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
All right.

165
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Well, these are three interesting words.

166
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,920
So why don't we hear some examples of each of these words in use?

167
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Example one.

168
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
I hate Tom.

169
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
He's such a dumbass.

170
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:45,000
Last week he borrowed my mobile phone and dropped it in the pool.

171
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Example two.

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,840
I don't like Kevin very much.

173
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,760
He can be a real moron at times.

174
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,880
Example three.

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,920
It was looking for a joke, but he didn't even have a resume prepared.

176
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
He's such a tool.

177
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:10,320
Okay, so great examples and here at EnglishPod, we're bringing you real street talk.

178
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Exactly.

179
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,920
Language as it is spoken by today's youth.

180
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay.

181
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Now let's take a look at our last two words.

182
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
All right.

183
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,120
Well, these phrases you can use when you're trying to calm yourself down and make yourself

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
relax a little bit, right?

185
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Right.

186
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Let's take a look at the next one.

187
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Chill.

188
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Chill.

189
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Okay.

190
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Chill.

191
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Chill.

192
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
So again, relax.

193
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Calm down.

194
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Calm down.

195
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Relax.

196
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Chill.

197
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Chill.

198
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Yes.

199
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
And then you also need to be cool.

200
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Be cool.

201
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Be cool.

202
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,960
Now if you can tell the pattern is related to temperature, right?

203
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Chill is cold.

204
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
Cool is similar to cold.

205
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,720
So again, that's what it means to relax.

206
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,600
To calm down your emotions.

207
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,120
Make your emotions not so hot.

208
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Exactly.

209
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
All right.

210
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
So chill.

211
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Be cool.

212
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Exactly.

213
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
And you use them together like that, don't you?

214
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Yeah.

215
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Now chill also has another way of using it, right?

216
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Exactly.

217
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm chilling with my friends.

218
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Yeah.

219
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
We're chilling here in the EnglishPod studio.

220
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,680
Which means we're just relaxing.

221
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,120
We are just having fun.

222
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Not doing anything, right?

223
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Exactly.

224
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,240
But you can't say chilling.

225
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,040
You have to drop the G. Yeah.

226
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
You have to drop.

227
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Right.

228
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
You can't say I'm chilling.

229
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,080
You have to say I'm chilling.

230
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I'm chilling.

231
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Okay.

232
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,160
So that's all for language takeaway.

233
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,000
But now let's take a look at some of the really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue

234
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
in Fluency Builder.

235
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,680
Okay.

236
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,160
So this guy is so happy he's on this date that he wants to scream at the top of his

237
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,320
lungs.

238
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,020
Scream at the top of my lungs.

239
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,560
Scream at the top of my lungs.

240
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,720
So basically he just wants to scream.

241
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,420
To shout really loudly.

242
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Really loudly.

243
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Yeah.

244
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
He's so excited, right?

245
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Exactly.

246
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
Okay.

247
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
So for example, sometimes you're at a concert, right?

248
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
Yep.

249
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,400
And you need to talk to your friend and you're screaming at the top of your lungs because

250
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,280
the other person can't hear you.

251
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Exactly.

252
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,280
So you're lost in the woods and you need to scream at the top of your lungs so that someone

253
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,840
will hear you and find you.

254
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
All right.

255
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Very good.

256
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Okay.

257
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
So scream at the top of my lungs.

258
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,240
Our next phrase.

259
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Get it together.

260
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Get it together.

261
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,320
Get it together.

262
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,480
So if I tell you, Erica, you need to get it together.

263
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Basically you're telling me to calm down, relax.

264
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,520
So pull your emotions together, get your ideas straight.

265
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Right.

266
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,200
So it kind of gives you this idea that you got to pull, like you said, pull your emotions

267
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,520
together in a little box and tie them up.

268
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
All right.

269
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
So get it together.

270
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Yep.

271
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,360
So Marco, when would you use this phrase, get it together?

272
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,880
I guess when somebody is either very emotional, maybe crying or very nervous, you tell the

273
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
person, oh, get it together, relax.

274
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,360
Or when somebody maybe is not doing something good in their life, like making bad decisions

275
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
or not being responsible, you tell that person, you need to get it together.

276
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Exactly.

277
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Right.

278
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Exactly.

279
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
I couldn't have said it better myself.

280
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Okay.

281
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,840
So now why don't we move on to our next phrase?

282
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
And this is really, really high frequency.

283
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
I think you would hear it all the time.

284
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
All right.

285
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,720
So what the hell?

286
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
What the hell?

287
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
What the hell?

288
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
So why would you say what the hell?

289
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,280
Well, obviously you're asking a question, right?

290
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,640
Because you got your W, you got your what.

291
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,440
But when you say the hell, you're putting emphasis on the what.

292
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,320
So you're asking a really strong question.

293
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Right.

294
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
It's not polite.

295
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
It's not polite.

296
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Yeah.

297
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Okay.

298
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
So if I say what the hell is going on?

299
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
What's happening?

300
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Really, really what's happening?

301
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Right?

302
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Yeah.

303
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
So, and we can change it a little bit.

304
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,320
We can replace the what with another WH like why, how, where, where or when.

305
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Yeah.

306
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Okay.

307
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,720
So why don't we hear some examples of how this expression is used using different WH

308
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,600
words?

309
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,080
Example one, where the hell are you?

310
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,960
I've been waiting for hours.

311
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,120
Example two, how the hell did you do that?

312
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,960
That was amazing.

313
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,520
Example three, when the hell are you going to find a job?

314
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm tired of paying for everything.

315
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,880
Example four, who the hell are you?

316
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,760
I don't know you.

317
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,280
All right.

318
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,840
Now our final word, also a little bit strong, but pretty high frequency.

319
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh yeah.

320
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Very high frequency.

321
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Oh crap.

322
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh crap.

323
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Oh crap.

324
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,320
So it's a little bit strong, but less strong than maybe saying a really bad word.

325
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Right?

326
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Yes.

327
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,120
But it's definitely saying like you made a mistake.

328
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Right?

329
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Yeah.

330
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
It's like a really strong, oh no.

331
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Oh no.

332
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Exactly.

333
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
A really strong, oh no.

334
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Yeah.

335
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
But I guess not many people say, oh no.

336
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Oh no.

337
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,680
I just lost $10 million.

338
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Exactly.

339
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Right?

340
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
You would not say that.

341
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Yeah.

342
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,720
So it's a very strong, oh no, but it's not as strong as it could be.

343
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,280
There are other words out there that are stronger, but we are not going to go into them here.

344
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,880
But maybe you guys know, so let us know.

345
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Yes.

346
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,520
We can definitely keep an eye out on the comment section.

347
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,880
But don't write the words in the comment section.

348
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Okay.

349
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,420
So we saw some really great phrases, some really great words, a lot of informal language,

350
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,160
but it's very high frequency and you'll use that with your friends or you'll see it in

351
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
movies, TV shows.

352
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Yeah.

353
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,520
Really common in movies and TV shows.

354
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Exactly.

355
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,240
So let's listen to this dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk a little

356
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
bit more.

357
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,640
Miss, your salad.

358
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,300
Hmm.

359
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Looks good.

360
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,240
I'm positively famished.

361
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
And for you, sir.

362
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you.

363
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Enjoy.

364
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you.

365
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,660
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

366
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,620
I'm so lucky.

367
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,260
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

368
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,700
Screaming at the top of my lungs, I'm the luckiest dude in the world!

369
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,060
Oh, shut up!

370
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
Don't be such a dumbass.

371
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,060
She's so hot!

372
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Wait, I can't say that.

373
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,060
I'm getting sexist.

374
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
She's making me sexist. Oh my god!

375
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I'm such a tool!

376
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
Okay, get it together.

377
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
She's eating salad. Oh right.

378
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I have a salad.

379
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Oh crap, which fork do I use?

380
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Damn it! She's gonna think I'm a moron.

381
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
What the hell are all these forks for?

382
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Which one did she use?

383
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Okay, chill. Be cool.

384
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Just take a fork.

385
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Eat your salad.

386
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Um...

387
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,060
Mm?

388
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Oh, sorry. What were you saying?

389
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,060
You're eating my salad.

390
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Oh, yes. It's delicious.

391
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,060
So these slang words, they're actually very common, right?

392
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Yeah, I think like you said, it's not likely that you'll find them in a dictionary.

393
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,060
Of course. And you can find them in movies, or sometimes when you're having a conversation,

394
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
a very informal conversation with a native speaker,

395
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,060
these words will slip out and these slang terms will come up.

396
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Exactly. And you know what? There's a great resource out there for wonderful English slang terms,

397
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,060
called UrbanDictionary.com.

398
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Exactly. If you ever see a word that maybe you can't find in the conventional dictionary,

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,060
you're probably gonna find it there.
