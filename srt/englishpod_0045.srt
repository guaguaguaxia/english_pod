00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,720
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,760
And today we're bringing you part four of our romantic series called I'm Sorry I Love

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
You.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah, and today we've got some drama, don't we?

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
We got a lot of drama and we got a lot of useful language.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,920
Yeah, we're going to learn some phrases we can use to describe a mistake and we're also

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,400
going to learn how we can comfort someone.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
We can make them feel better.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,560
Okay, exactly.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,760
So in our dialogue today, Veronica and her boyfriend are on a break.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Right.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,120
So what does it mean to be on a break?

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,240
Well, it means you stop having a romantic relationship for a short time.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,320
So you can say we are on a break.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
So we're not dating.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
We're not dating.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
But we don't date.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,840
Or we could say, let's take a break.

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Right.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,280
So we've got the state, on a break, and the action, take a break.

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Take a break.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Let's take a break.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,040
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue and it's going to be a little bit fast and the

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,560
girl, I think she's crying.

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,600
It'll be a little bit difficult to understand.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
But Marco and I will come back in a minute and we'll talk about some of the difficult

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:23,480
language here.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,320
So I said, let's take a break.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,840
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
him.

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,480
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,680
You think so?

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Oh no.

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
How could he do this to me?

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,040
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,160
Why else wouldn't he call?

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,880
But you two are on a break.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,240
Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
He's the love of my life.

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,640
I really messed this up.

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,120
Come on, hon, pull yourself together.

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,680
It's going to be all right.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,960
But I still love him and it's all my fault.

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,840
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
I mean, he is a firefighter.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,440
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,120
I totally messed this up.

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
You know what, Veronica?

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
I think you should make the first step.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
No, this is not going to happen.

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I ruined everything.

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,120
Hey, do you hear something?

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Guess what, it's your lovely firefighter.

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:22,440
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down and I wonder who...

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,240
Wow, that's a romantic boyfriend singing in the street.

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Have you ever done that for a girl?

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
No.

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,800
Well, have you ever sung to a girl at KTV?

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,640
I've sung to a girl on KTV.

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
And karaoke.

67
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Karaoke, yeah.

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,000
So, but not so much as on the street with all the neighbors coming out to see me.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Wow, okay, well, I don't blame you.

70
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,560
All right, let's take a look at the language that we saw in our dialogue on Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,040
Language Takeaway.

72
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,080
All right, so let's take a look at our first word, seeing someone.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
Seeing someone.

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Seeing someone.

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Seeing someone.

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
So, if I'm seeing someone...

77
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
You're dating them.

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
I'm dating them.

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Yeah.

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,120
I'm frequently going out with that person.

81
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Right.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,080
So, but it's not very serious.

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,040
No, it is serious.

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,000
But not really, it's more of a casual thing.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
It's not very exclusive.

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,440
So, if you are seeing someone, then you can also see another person.

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Maybe.

88
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Hmm.

89
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
Well, I think sometimes seeing someone can mean actually they're your boyfriend or girlfriend.

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Like I'm seeing John, he's my boyfriend.

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Okay.

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,580
Yeah, see, this is the difficult thing about seeing someone is that for some people it

93
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,440
means it's really serious, while for other people it means it's more casual.

94
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,360
I guess it's important that you and your boyfriend or girlfriend share the same view on the meaning

95
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
of this word.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,800
Right, have to agree on what seeing someone means.

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Okay, well, what's our next word, Marco?

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Cheating on.

99
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Cheating on someone.

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,440
Cheating on me.

101
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,760
Cheating on someone.

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay, so if you're cheating on someone.

103
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,680
Then you are like kissing or even having sex with someone who's not your boyfriend or

104
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
your husband or your girlfriend or your wife.

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Exactly.

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,880
So, if I say, she cheated on me.

107
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,320
That means that my girlfriend kissed or had sex with another guy.

108
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Right.

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
But if I say, she cheated me.

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah, that's different.

111
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
That's different, right?

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,480
Like, maybe she sold you something for a really high price.

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
She cheated me.

114
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Yeah.

115
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,680
Or maybe she sold me something that was fake.

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,560
Yeah, or broken or something.

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Yeah.

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,840
So, cheated on is really different from cheated.

119
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

120
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,200
Messed this up.

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,960
Messed this up.

122
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,440
Messed this up.

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Messed this up.

124
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,080
So, Marco, this is a phrasal verb and that means we can sort of switch it around a little

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
bit, right?

126
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Exactly.

127
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,600
So, let's listen to some examples and then we can come back and talk some more.

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
Example one.

129
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,640
I messed up on the exam and now I won't pass my class.

130
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,680
Example two.

131
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,160
When I'm cooking, I always mess up and burn the rice.

132
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,480
Okay, so messed up.

133
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It's pretty clear, I think.

134
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,280
All right, let's take a look at our next word.

136
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Immature.

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Immature.

138
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Immature.

139
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Immature.

140
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,760
So, when someone is immature...

141
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
They're acting really young.

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Really young, right?

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Yeah.

144
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
But it's not a very good thing to be immature.

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
No, it has a negative meaning.

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Right.

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,480
It's normal for children to be immature.

148
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
Because they're children.

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,280
Right, but not an adult.

150
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Yes.

151
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Okay.

152
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,080
So, we've got some examples that will help you to understand this word a little bit better.

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,840
Example one.

154
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,080
Your toilet jokes are not funny.

155
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Stop being so immature.

156
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,720
Example two.

157
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,560
Jeannie acts like she's 16.

158
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,000
She's so immature.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,920
Example three.

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
You and your friends always act so immature.

161
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,240
All right, so immature.

162
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,280
Now let's take a look at our next word.

163
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Selfish.

164
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Selfish.

165
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Selfish.

166
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Selfish.

167
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
So, a selfish person...

168
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,880
Is a person who only thinks about themselves.

169
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay, so I only think about me.

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
No one else.

171
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, you don't care about other people's feelings.

172
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay.

173
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,040
So, it's not a good thing to be immature or selfish.

174
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Exactly.

175
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Okay, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

176
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

177
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:39,800
And this will help you to understand these phrases a little bit more clearly.

178
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,280
So I said, let's take a break.

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,680
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call.

180
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
But I still haven't heard from him.

181
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,160
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

182
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,760
Come on.

183
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,720
Don't be so dramatic.

184
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
You think so?

186
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,920
Oh no.

187
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,600
How can he do this to me?

188
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

189
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Why else wouldn't he call?

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,320
But you two are on a break, theoretically.

191
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,520
He can do whatever he likes.

192
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,280
He's the love of my life.

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,200
I've really messed this up.

194
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,040
Come on, hun.

195
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,160
Pull yourself together.

196
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,480
It's going to be all right.

197
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,020
But I still love him.

198
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,360
And it's all my fault.

199
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,040
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

200
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,000
I mean, he is a firefighter.

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,560
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

202
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,800
I've totally messed this up.

203
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
You know what, Veronica?

204
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I think you should make the first step.

205
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

206
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,960
No.

207
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,320
This is not going to happen.

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
I've ruined everything.

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,360
Hey, do you hear something?

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
Guess what?

211
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,400
It's your lovely firefighter.

212
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:37,640
Okay, so we saw Veronica's friend trying to calm her down.

213
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
Yeah, trying to comfort her.

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,480
Okay, to make her feel better.

215
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,280
Let's take a look at some of the phrases she used in Fluency Builder.

216
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Fluency Builder.

217
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, so what was the first phrase that she said?

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Everything is going to work out just fine.

219
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Everything is going to work out just fine.

220
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,240
Everything is going to work out just fine.

221
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
What does that mean?

222
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
It's going to be okay.

223
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
It's going to be okay, right?

224
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,160
Yeah, the problem will be solved.

225
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, so if somebody is worried or somebody is crying, you can say, don't worry, everything

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,360
is going to work out just fine.

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,600
Okay, let's look at the next one.

228
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,960
Pull yourself together.

229
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,600
Pull yourself together.

230
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,880
Pull yourself together.

231
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,400
Pull yourself together.

232
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
So what does that mean exactly?

233
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
It sounds kind of weird.

234
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,760
I know, I guess it just means stop crying, relax, and take a deep breath.

235
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,080
Just like calm down.

236
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Yeah.

237
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,880
Get organized with your ideas and your thoughts.

238
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,680
So you can think of maybe somebody who's got tears down their face and everything is sort

239
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
of in a mess.

240
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,280
If you pull it together, they clean up and they sort of relax, right?

241
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Okay.

242
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Pull yourself together.

243
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,280
All right, and the last phrase that we saw, it's going to be all right.

244
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,720
It's going to be all right.

245
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
It's going to be all right.

246
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,720
It's going to be all right.

247
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,280
So it's going to be all right means everything is going to be okay.

248
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,240
Yeah, it's going to be fine.

249
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
It's going to be fine.

250
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
The problem will go away.

251
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
You'll feel better.

252
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,080
Maybe you could even say, it'll be all right.

253
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
It'll be all right.

255
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Yeah.

256
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,800
These are three really helpful phrases that you can use when you want to say something

257
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,640
nice to a friend or a colleague who has a problem.

258
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,880
Okay, exactly.

259
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Very useful language.

260
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
So let's listen to some more examples.

261
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Example one.

262
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,480
Don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine.

263
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,160
I'm sure he still loves you.

264
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,000
Example two.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
Everything is going to be all right.

266
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
We'll find your puppy.

267
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't worry.

268
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, great examples and I think it's clear now.

269
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,960
So let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk some more.

270
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,800
So I said, let's take a break.

271
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,320
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from

272
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,440
him.

273
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,960
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

274
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,760
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

275
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

276
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,160
You think so?

277
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Oh no.

278
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,400
How could he do this to me?

279
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

280
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,640
Why else wouldn't he call?

281
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,360
But you two are on a break.

282
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,720
Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

283
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,840
He's the love of my life.

284
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,120
I really messed this up.

285
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Come on, hon.

286
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,600
Pull yourself together.

287
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,160
It's going to be all right.

288
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,440
But I still love him and it's all my fault.

289
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,320
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,600
I mean, he is a firefighter.

291
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,880
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

292
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,560
I totally messed this up.

293
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,960
You know what, Veronica?

294
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,280
I think you should make the first step.

295
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,960
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

296
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,120
No, this is not going to happen.

297
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,120
I ruined everything.

298
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,600
Hey, do you hear something?

299
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Guess what, it's your lovely firefighter.

300
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:55,720
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down and I wonder who...

301
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,320
Okay, I really like this dialogue.

302
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
It's so romantic.

303
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Yeah.

304
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,600
It's romantic but at the same time romantic.

305
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,040
So we want to know what you think will happen next.

306
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,200
Yeah, will they get back together?

307
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,360
Will they get married?

308
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,640
Will they have a baby?

309
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Maybe they'll break up forever.

310
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,760
Maybe she'll move halfway across the world.

311
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,320
Anything can happen so let us know what you think will happen.

312
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,880
Come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave your comments on the lesson page.

313
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,600
Exactly, and maybe you'll be right.

314
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, you never know.

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,880
Okay, so we're out of time for today.

316
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,400
I hope you guys had fun and we'll see you next time.

317
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Until then, it's goodbye.

318
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Bye.
