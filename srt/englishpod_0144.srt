00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
And my name is Katherine.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,240
And today we're talking about something very serious.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Very serious.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,560
Today we're talking about capital punishment.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,080
So if you've never heard that phrase before, you might have heard another name for this

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
topic.

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,800
It's called the death penalty.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Right.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
So if you commit a crime and basically the judge says that you will have to be put to

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
death for that crime.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
All right.

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,920
So many countries no longer have this.

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,560
This law, the United States, you can see it in some places, some states, but not in others.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,600
So what we're talking about today is the debate between to have the death penalty and to not

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
have it.

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
All right.

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
So we're going to actually have a little debate in the end of if we agree that we should have

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,640
the death penalty or not.

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,160
But before that, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:58,880
That's all for today's class.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:07,200
We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
Well, it depends on what you mean.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,000
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,200
for lesser offenses and lock up juvenile offenders.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,680
Those sound like really draconian measures.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
people to death?

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,440
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
person.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,680
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
for many years.

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,600
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,860
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer

39
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,840
prison sentences to deter serious crime.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,200
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,520
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
be caught.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,760
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,360
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,240
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,960
can't get away with it.

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,840
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,640
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

50
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,240
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,600
the right thing.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,920
You sound like a dictator.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,440
Well, if it works, why not?

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,800
All right, so Marco, there's a lot of really great legal terms here, legal and crime terms.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,200
And so let's look at a few of these in today's Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,280
All right, so let's take a look at the first one.

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,360
They mentioned juvenile offenders.

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,720
All right, so let's look at these two words because, well, offender can be pretty general.

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,440
It's someone who commits a crime.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,680
So an offender.

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,640
But we're talking about a special kind of offender.

64
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,880
Here we're talking about juvenile offenders.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
So they're young offenders.

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Right.

67
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,040
In America, legally, you're a juvenile offender if you're under the age of 18.

68
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,200
Okay, so if you commit a crime while you are a juvenile, you get judged differently, right?

69
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
You don't get the same treatment as an adult.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Right.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,200
Usually, the punishments are not as harsh because people like to think that younger

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,080
people, younger children or teenagers, they don't really understand the law.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
They don't really understand crime or good and bad.

74
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,320
So it should be easier on them.

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,880
All right, very good.

76
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,040
So we have juvenile offenders and we also have wrongful conviction.

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,280
All right, this is an uh-oh moment for a judge because a wrongful conviction, well, conviction

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,560
first of all is a decision.

79
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,000
So this is a court's decision on whether or not a person is guilty.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,640
So you convicted the person.

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Right.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,720
Marco was convicted guilty of stealing my computer.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,280
I was too.

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
That happened.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Right.

86
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,160
But it's a wrongful conviction if Marco didn't really steal a computer but we decided that

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
he did.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Okay.

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,920
So it was a wrong decision.

90
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Right.

91
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,520
It was a bad decision in the sense that it's actually not what happened in reality.

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,200
A wrongful conviction.

93
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Very good.

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,440
And actually related to a wrongful conviction, many times it happens because evidence is

95
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
fabricated by the police.

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Right.

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
So this is a big no-no.

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,800
This is something that really shouldn't happen and it's against the law in many countries.

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,600
So fabrication or to fabricate is to fake, to make something up.

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,000
And so evidence that's fabricated is evidence that the police or other people create to

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,200
try and make someone look guilty but it's not actually evidence.

102
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
It's not really.

103
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
That's not true.

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
It's not true.

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Right.

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,560
And now moving on, they were talking about a deterrent for crime.

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,320
Okay, so to deter is a verb.

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,440
To deter means to try and get someone to not do something.

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
All right.

110
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,040
So I'm going to try and deter my staff from taking early lunch breaks.

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,960
So I'm going to punish someone as a deterrent.

112
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
As a deterrent.

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Okay.

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,480
So you have the verb deter and you have the noun a deterrent.

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Right.

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Yeah.

117
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,600
And so oftentimes very strict laws are meant to be deterrents.

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,280
They're meant to keep people from doing bad things, from breaking the law.

119
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
All right.

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,280
So for example, capital punishment is one of those deterrents.

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,040
If you kill somebody, then if you get caught, you are also going to be killed.

122
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,880
So that means I'm never going to kill anyone because I don't want the law to decide that

123
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm going to get killed.

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Exactly.

125
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,920
And our last word for today, they were talking about imposing tougher laws.

126
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,800
I would impose tougher laws.

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay.

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,960
So to impose is a verb that means to put in place or to set up or enact.

129
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
And so...

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
You don't really impose, right?

131
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,240
You don't really agree to do it.

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Like the dictator imposes his will.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right.

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
So he makes everyone do what he wants.

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,040
But we can impose measures that do something.

136
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,960
It's kind of like forcibly making people follow some kind of rule or follow a person.

137
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,120
Now sometimes you would see that you have a company or you have people at your house

138
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,560
and they're like, well, you know, stay over for dinner.

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,640
And they're like, oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
All right.

141
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,840
Well, I wouldn't want to bother you or I wouldn't want to create more work for you because,

142
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,280
you know, when you're making food, you have all these people, they don't want to impose

143
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
on you.

144
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
All right.

145
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
So that's another way of using this, impose on somebody.

146
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
All right.

147
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,160
So after all of these words that we've taken a look at, why don't we start now with Fluency

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,120
Builder?

149
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Fluency Builder.

150
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Okay.

151
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,800
So as you know, Fluency Builder is a place where we get to talk about some phrases and

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,040
words that allow you to be more fluent in English.

153
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,760
So these are sometimes idioms or sometimes phrases, words that go together commonly.

154
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,080
And the first one is no exception.

155
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,920
It's a miscarriage.

156
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
So miscarriage of justice.

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
All right.

158
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,040
A miscarriage of justice.

159
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Now we have different words here.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,280
The first one, miscarriage, it's usually related to a medical term.

161
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Right.

162
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
It's a pregnancy.

163
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,160
Well, it's a pregnancy that has a sad result.

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,560
It's a pregnancy where the woman's baby dies or the woman loses the baby.

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,340
And a miscarriage of justice is a metaphor.

166
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,960
It's a way to say that justice was not carried out.

167
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,400
It means that, for example, with those wrongful convictions, the law failed.

168
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
To accomplish its objective.

169
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Yeah.

170
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,120
To accomplish its objective and to be fair.

171
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Okay.

172
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,920
So a miscarriage of justice.

173
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Interesting.

174
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,520
And moving on to our next phrase, they were talking and discussing this whole death penalty

175
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,840
situation and she mentioned, in my reckoning.

176
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
All right.

177
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,960
So this is a great way to share your opinion or your idea with someone.

178
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,600
You're saying pretty much, in my opinion, in my, according to me or, you know, the way

179
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm thinking is this.

180
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,560
So I can also say, I reckon, right?

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Exactly.

182
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I reckon it's going to rain later.

183
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,140
I think it's going to rain.

184
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,120
So in my reckoning, in my opinion.

185
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
All right.

186
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,220
I reckon.

187
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,440
And to finish off Fluency Builder, they said that the person or the criminal couldn't get

188
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
away with it.

189
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
All right.

190
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,800
So this is another one of those phrases that each word maybe means something different.

191
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,300
You can get somewhere.

192
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:42,360
But put together, to get away with something means to do something bad or illegal or that's

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,120
not okay without getting caught.

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Or being punished.

195
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Or being punished.

196
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,360
So you can say, get away with murder.

197
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
He got away with murder.

198
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,800
You know, he did something that was really, really bad but no one caught him.

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
And also it means the criminal got away so they couldn't catch him.

200
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Or I could always say to my brother, he would always lie to my parents and get away with

201
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
it.

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
So he never got caught.

203
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
He never got punished.

204
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Okay.

205
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,640
So he got away with his lie or got away, got his way.

206
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
All right.

207
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,120
So I think this is an interesting phrase.

208
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
Why don't we listen to a couple of more examples.

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,360
Example one.

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,720
Do you think we could get away with using the cheaper product?

211
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,640
Example two.

212
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Thieves got away with two Picassos which were never found.

213
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Example three.

214
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,560
He almost got away with murder.

215
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,120
Unfortunately for him, the police discovered his secret.

216
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,480
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

217
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,760
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

218
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,080
That's all for today's class.

219
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:06,560
We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.

220
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,680
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

221
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,600
Well it depends on what you mean.

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences

223
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,520
for lesser offenses, and lock up juvenile offenders.

224
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,960
Those sound like really draconian measures.

225
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,040
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent

226
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
people to death?

227
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,680
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,720
person.

229
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,040
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned

230
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,280
for many years.

231
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,960
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

232
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,240
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer

234
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,200
prison sentences to deter serious crime.

235
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,560
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

236
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,880
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to

237
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
be caught.

238
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

240
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,640
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they

241
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,320
can't get away with it.

242
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,600
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,240
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

244
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,960
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

245
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,040
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

246
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,600
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing

247
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
the right thing.

248
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,320
You sound like a dictator.

249
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,400
Well, if it works, why not?

250
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:51,200
All right, so now the big question, Catherine, do you agree with the death penalty?

251
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,920
Oh, this is a big one, and I don't think we have enough time to go into it in much detail

252
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,280
here, but I definitely think that is extreme, right?

253
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,760
And so we have this phrase, draconian measures.

254
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
Right, they mentioned that in the dialogue.

255
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah, so draconian, something that's draconian is excessive or severe, you know?

256
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,880
And I think that there are a lot of reasons not to have the death penalty, because the

257
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,320
death penalty, well, you're pretty much saying we as a society think that murder is wrong,

258
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
but we're going to show you that you've done a wrong thing, like a bad thing that's against

259
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
the law by killing you.

260
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,240
All right, and so I have to disagree with that on a philosophical level.

261
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,080
But what about practical?

262
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Practically speaking, I think that there are a lot of problems with the prison system and

263
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,040
the legal system in the United States, for example, because prisons are really crowded.

264
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,160
1% of the American population is in prison.

265
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,360
And so I think that so long as the prison system still has problems, there's a really

266
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,160
good argument for having the death penalty.

267
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,160
But still, I think that it's excessive and it's unnecessary and that there are other

268
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,960
ways to treat and punish prisoners.

269
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,880
It is an interesting topic because you have many different angles that are in favor or

270
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,720
against the death penalty.

271
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,020
For example, you have religious views where you say that you should not take a life of

272
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,560
another person no matter what.

273
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,880
Or you have other views that say that the death penalty is simply wrong and that you

274
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,320
can't right a wrong with another wrong.

275
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Right, exactly.

276
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,040
So it kind of doesn't make sense.

277
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,800
But at the same time, you do, like you say, the prisons are full of people and it costs

278
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,600
around I think it's $12,000 a year per person to keep them in prison.

279
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
So what do you do with all of these people that have life sentences that are going to

280
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
spend the rest of their lives in jail?

281
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,440
So it is interesting and many countries are very, very strict with their legal system

282
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,800
in comparison with the United States, right?

283
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Definitely, but there is a statistic that's pretty stunning that I think among the top

284
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,920
20 developed nations in the world, I think only the United States is the one with the

285
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
death penalty.

286
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Exactly.

287
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,460
And actually, the ratio of people compared to the population that are in jail is much

288
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,720
higher in the United States than in other countries.

289
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
That's true.

290
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,320
So it is a very questionable topic, but we want to know what you think.

291
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,800
Do you think that the death penalty is a justifiable way to do justice?

292
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Or do you think maybe it's just wrong and we shouldn't have it anymore?

293
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, we're hoping that this will get the conversation going on our website.

294
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,680
If you have any opinions, please let us know about them.

295
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,600
EnglishPod.com is the website and of course, you can always email us or send us a PM if

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
you're a little bit shy.

297
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

298
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Bye everyone.

299
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,040
Bye.
