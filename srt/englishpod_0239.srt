00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,760
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about sports and outdoor activities.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
That's right.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,120
We are taking a look at a lot of different adventure sports.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,280
So they're not just regular sports like tennis or soccer.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,660
These are more dangerous sports.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,660
That's right.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,660
So adventure sports is the topic.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,200
This is intermediate level.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:37,540
Let's check out the dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,900
Welcome to Adventure Tours.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
How may I help you?

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,700
I want to book a tour with Adventure Sports.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
Excellent.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,140
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field.

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,140
Let me show you some options.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,420
This is our most popular choice.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,900
Our river guides will take you on a white water rafting trip followed by a ride in a

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,060
hot air balloon.

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,860
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,780
boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,780
What else do you have?

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,860
Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,220
It's the closest you can get to flying.

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,220
What?

27
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,540
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,540
No thank you.

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
Next.

30
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,540
Okay.

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,220
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like?

32
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,500
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,980
I'm thinking something exciting but safer.

34
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,860
I have the perfect option.

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,020
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,220
there's a dog sledding journey.

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,060
That's more like it.

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,320
Alright, we're back.

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,140
So obviously this tour agency or tour operator has a lot of different options.

40
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:00,700
A lot of them exciting so why don't we take a look at some of those on Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,140
Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,140
So the first one has to do with water.

43
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,060
This is called white water rafting.

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
That's right.

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,380
So white water rafting.

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,180
Now rafting means that you go in a raft.

47
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,180
That's right.

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,700
It's a special kind of boat, not a wooden boat, not like a big boat you see in the ocean.

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,180
This is a special boat for rivers maybe.

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
That's right.

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,900
It's an inflatable rubber boat.

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,500
So he also described it as a rubber boat.

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,220
Okay, rubber is the material it's made out of.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
That's right.

55
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:42,140
So you go in this boat in a river and it's called white water because it has rapids.

56
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,540
So the river is moving very quickly and you can see that it's a little bit dangerous to

57
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,340
go swimming in a river like this.

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
That's right.

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,620
So the water goes really fast or when it hits some rocks, the color changes from being blue

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,300
or brown to white and that's why it's white water rafting.

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,860
It's very, very scary and very dangerous.

62
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,220
That's right, but very exciting.

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,620
So that's considered an adventure sport.

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,460
And then the trip was followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,540
Well everyone's seen balloons before.

66
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,540
Sometimes we give children balloons at the fair or maybe for their birthday.

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,260
Balloons are basically rubber filled with air.

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,100
But a hot air balloon is a very special kind of mode of transportation actually.

69
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,280
You can travel in a hot air balloon.

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
That's right.

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,540
It's a big, big balloon that has a basket under it and the person actually described

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,300
it as a wicker basket.

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,340
A wicker is the material that's used in the basket, right?

74
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
That's right.

75
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,260
It's not furniture like wicker chairs.

76
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:52,500
It's just a way to basically make furniture out of this kind of bark or natural material.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,020
So a hot air balloon is a very big balloon and it's filled with hot air, usually by some

78
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,500
sort of fire that's under it.

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,460
And because it's filled with hot air, it goes up in the air and as you say, you can use

80
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,340
it as transportation, maybe to go very long distances carried by the wind because there's

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,820
no real way of giving a direction or just for fun.

82
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
That's right.

83
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,580
It's another dangerous but less dangerous kind of sport.

84
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,140
But after that, we actually have one that I think you have some experience with.

85
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,660
It's called hang gliding.

86
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,660
That's right.

87
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,780
Hang gliding is another type of sport and also a type of flying sport and basically

88
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,420
you get on a hang glider.

89
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,460
Okay.

90
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,580
So if you've seen this before, you'll know that it looks like someone is wearing wings.

91
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
That's right.

92
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,020
It's a big kite that you wear.

93
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,900
It's a big kite.

94
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,580
It kind of looks like a triangle, like a kite.

95
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
And you fly in it.

96
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,680
So it has no motor.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,060
It has not like the hot air balloon, it has no fire.

98
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,100
So you just basically glide.

99
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,860
You just sail through the air, the atmosphere.

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Sounds very peaceful.

101
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
It is.

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,540
But they say that you should go with an instructor.

103
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,460
So what kind of instructor does this tour company offer?

104
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
That's right.

105
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,620
So our operator talked about taking you on a hang glider trip with one of our experienced

106
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,500
instructors.

107
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,900
So experienced is the key word here.

108
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,740
You want someone who has done this many times before, someone who knows what they are doing.

109
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,740
That's right.

110
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,340
So an experienced instructor is a person that has, as you say, a lot of experience or is

111
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,680
a professional.

112
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,940
So that's an experienced instructor.

113
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
Right.

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,020
You could even say, you know, I want to take flying lessons with an experienced pilot.

115
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Right.

116
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,580
Or you can even talk about maybe a chef.

117
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,700
He is a very experienced chef.

118
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,180
He's been a chef for a long time.

119
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
That's right.

120
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,340
So hang gliding.

121
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,660
And our final sport, very exciting as well.

122
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,780
We are going dog sledding.

123
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,780
Okay.

124
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,620
So this is basically a winter sport or a sport that you do in snowy places.

125
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,660
You stand or sit on a sled and a team of dogs, so that means many dogs, pull you across the

126
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
snow.

127
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
That's right.

128
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,460
So you go on a sled, which is basically usually made out of plastic or wood, and this is to

129
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,780
go on top of the snow.

130
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,140
And as you say, a team of dogs pull you.

131
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,020
I think you can see this in movies.

132
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,540
This is kind of like the mode of transportation in places where there are no roads, there

133
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,940
are no other ways of getting places that you just get pulled by dogs.

134
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,620
Like Alaska or the Arctic Circle, somewhere very, very far north.

135
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Exactly.

136
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,220
So a lot of great adventure sports.

137
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
Very exciting.

138
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,500
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue again.

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:48,100
And we'll be back in a bit with Language Takeaway Part 2.

140
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,460
Welcome to Adventure Tours.

141
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
How may I help you?

142
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,220
I want to book a tour with Adventure Sports.

143
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
Excellent.

144
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,700
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the adventure, tourism, and sports field.

145
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Let me show you some options.

146
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,980
This is our most popular choice.

147
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,020
Our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air

148
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,020
balloon.

149
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,380
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber

150
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,300
boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

151
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
What else do you have?

152
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,380
Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

153
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,660
It's the closest you can get to flying.

154
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
What?

155
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,060
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

156
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,060
No thank you.

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Next?

158
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Mm, OK.

159
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,740
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like?

160
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,980
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

161
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,500
I'm thinking something exciting but safer.

162
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,380
I have the perfect option.

163
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,540
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards

164
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,740
there's a dog sledding journey.

165
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
That's more like it.

166
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,660
All right, we're back.

167
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,700
So now we're going to take a look at three quick adjectives that we saw in this dialogue

168
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,940
on Language Takeaway Part 2.

169
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,420
Language Takeaway.

170
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,660
This first adjective is something I'm not a fan of.

171
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,420
Let me just say if you ever go rafting and you see rocks, you want to avoid or you want

172
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,420
to stay away from jagged rocks.

173
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
That's right.

174
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,700
So the adjective jagged refers to maybe sharp or they can cut you, right?

175
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
That's right.

176
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,260
So something that is jagged is not smooth.

177
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,940
It's the opposite of smooth.

178
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
That's right.

179
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,340
So maybe you've seen some rocks that are very pointy or that have things that can easily

180
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,540
hurt you or cut you.

181
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,580
Those are jagged rocks.

182
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,980
Broken glass can have jagged edges and that means you want to avoid touching it because

183
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
it can hurt you.

184
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Exactly.

185
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,780
So jagged is a way of describing something that's maybe sharp, pointy or very dangerous

186
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,940
that can cut you.

187
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,020
And then moving on, when we were talking about the hot air balloon, this person very cleverly

188
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:07,260
said that he doesn't want to go up in the air in a basket held by an oversized balloon.

189
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,300
Okay, so he's exaggerating.

190
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,820
Like you said, he's being clever or silly.

191
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,420
He's just afraid of the balloon.

192
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:22,180
But basically he's saying an oversized balloon is a very, very, very big or unnaturally big

193
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
balloon.

194
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
Right.

195
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
So bigger than normal.

196
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,420
So an oversized balloon would be a balloon that's bigger than normal.

197
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,020
Or maybe I've seen an oversized...

198
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,820
In the early 1990s, I remember a clothing trend, a lot of people like to wear oversized

199
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
t-shirts.

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
That's right.

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,460
So t-shirts that were way too big for you or maybe unnaturally big, those would be oversized

202
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
t-shirts.

203
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Like XXXL.

204
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Exactly.

205
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,460
All right.

206
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:54,060
And our final adjective when he was talking about hang gliding, he said that he's not

207
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,340
ready to go up in the air strapped to a flimsy kite.

208
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,180
Okay, so the key word here is flimsy.

209
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,380
We already talked about a kite.

210
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,100
It's something that flies in the air.

211
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,020
But something that's flimsy is not very stable or sturdy.

212
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
That's right.

213
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,620
So it doesn't seem like it's very solid.

214
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,860
So if you have a kite...

215
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,180
So a normal airplane is very sturdy, but a paper airplane is very flimsy.

216
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,420
It's thin, it moves around a lot.

217
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,620
You can't control it.

218
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Exactly.

219
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,620
So it's not very solid.

220
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,180
It's not very, as you said, sturdy.

221
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,980
It doesn't really seem like it can stay up in the air for very long.

222
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,700
And it definitely can't support someone's weight.

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
That's right.

224
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,420
So you can even have a flimsy chair.

225
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,940
Maybe the chair is a little bit loose or it doesn't seem like it's very strong.

226
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,700
It feels like it might break.

227
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
That's right.

228
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,020
So flimsy.

229
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,980
That's the adjective there, flimsy.

230
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,940
So that's all the adjectives we have for you today.

231
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,260
Why don't we listen to the dialogue quickly one last time and we'll be back to talk a

232
00:10:53,260 --> 00:11:02,580
little bit more.

233
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,100
Welcome to Adventure Tours.

234
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
How may I help you?

235
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,860
I want to book a tour with Adventure Sports.

236
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,860
Excellent!

237
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,340
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the adventure, tourism, and sports field.

238
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Let me show you some options.

239
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,620
This is our most popular choice.

240
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,100
Our river guides will take you on a white water rafting trip followed by a ride in a

241
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,220
hot air balloon.

242
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,020
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber

243
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,900
boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

244
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
What else do you have?

245
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,980
Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

246
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,300
It's the closest you can get to flying.

247
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
What?

248
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,660
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

249
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660
No thank you.

250
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Next?

251
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Okay.

252
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,360
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like?

253
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,660
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

254
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,140
I'm thinking something exciting but safer.

255
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,020
I have the perfect option.

256
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,180
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards

257
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,380
there's a dog sledding journey.

258
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:13,900
That's more like it.

259
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,580
Okay so Marco, I know this is one of your favorite areas, Adventure Sports.

260
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,500
You're a lot more daring than I am because I wouldn't do many of these things but what

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
have you done?

262
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,260
I've actually haven't been in a hot air balloon.

263
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,780
I don't really think that's very exciting.

264
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
It does seem kind of boring.

265
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,620
Yeah, you don't really go very fast.

266
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,380
And I've never done a street luge which is an interesting sport although it is pretty

267
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
dangerous.

268
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,260
It's basically, you're kind of riding on a type of skateboard, right?

269
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,780
Yeah, basically it's a big skateboard and you lie down on it, your feet go down and

270
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,300
your head is back.

271
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,340
You're on your back and you go downhill really fast.

272
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,780
This is actually an Olympic sport and it's simply called luge and you can see this with

273
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,540
those big icy tracks that they have and they go downhill and they slide down on a bob sled

274
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:13,300
or luge would actually be the same thing but just one or two people on some type of like

275
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,860
skateboard looking thing.

276
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,300
Basically it's open.

277
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,660
The bob sled is closed so you see the people's heads but the luge you just see their whole

278
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,700
body and they're lying down on a piece of metal and they go down very, very quickly.

279
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
They go very fast.

280
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,980
I think in bob sledding and luge, I think they can reach speeds up to like 100 kilometers

281
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
per hour or more.

282
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,980
That's right.

283
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,620
And this year it was actually very sad at the Olympics.

284
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,020
A luge, I think it was luge athlete died in practice.

285
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
That's right.

286
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,620
So extreme sports or adventure sports, they are as the name says full of adventure, very

287
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,020
exciting but also obviously very dangerous.

288
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,780
I think hiking is not really an adventure sport or very dangerous unless you're hiking

289
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,900
in dangerous territory with bears or something.

290
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Possible.

291
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,380
Well, maybe you guys should let us know what kind of sports do you do.

292
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,260
Do you enjoy adventure sports?

293
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,740
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

294
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Alright.

295
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
We'll see everyone there.

296
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,200
Thanks for heading out.
