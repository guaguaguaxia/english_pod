00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about buying clothes.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
That's right.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,200
We're going to go and get some clothes but on this occasion, we're going to get a suit

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
and we're going to have it made especially for us.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,040
So before we get started, why don't we take a look at one keyword that we have in Vocabulary

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,320
Preview.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,640
Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,280
Okay, this word makes me think of things that are very rich and soft.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
It's a fabric, right?

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
That's right.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
It's a kind of textile.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
It's called cashmere.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Cashmere.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,520
So maybe you've heard of cashmere wool.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,120
It's a special kind of wool that comes from animals.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,840
So this is a textile or a fabric that is commonly used to make pants, nice pants or suits for

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
men.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Or scars or sweaters.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,760
If you've ever had a cashmere sweater, you know it's very luxurious, very soft.

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
So it can be a little bit expensive depending on the quality and that's what we're going

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
to be looking at now.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,200
We're going to be making a suit out of cashmere.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:12,600
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,960
Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,440
What can I do for you today?

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,720
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Sure we do.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,360
We're the best tailors in the country.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,400
What is it that you need exactly?

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Well I'm looking to get a custom made suit.

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Excellent.

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,760
We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,200
How about we get you measured?

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,100
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,360
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,600
My neck gets easily irritated.

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
No problem.

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,560
Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,520
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Okay.

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,760
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,360
Please follow me.

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,880
So this reminds me of something that people used to do a lot more often.

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,480
So you'd go to the tailor and you'd have some clothes made.

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
Most people don't do this anymore.

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Yeah.

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,960
It's actually really interesting.

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,640
Maybe because it's more expensive nowadays or tailors are harder to find.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
That's right.

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,440
So let's learn about the words first and what they mean and then maybe we can talk about

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,480
this at the end of today's show.

56
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Language takeaway.

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,520
Alright, so today on language takeaway we have a word that is a noun and a verb.

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,160
So as you mentioned, the person that makes suits is a tailor.

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
That's right.

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,040
You can say, my uncle is a tailor.

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,280
He makes clothes for famous people.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,780
But this word is also a verb.

63
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,120
That means it's an action word.

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,000
We can say, my uncle the tailor, he tailors clothes.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Okay, so to tailor clothes.

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,200
And what does it mean when you say to tailor?

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Well, it can have two meanings.

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
The first is what we learn about in today's dialogue.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,360
It means to make clothes.

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,760
So to make a shirt or to make a pair of pants.

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,960
But these days we often say to tailor which means to fix something.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,320
So for example, Marco, if you buy a pair of pants and they're too long, you can have them

73
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
tailored.

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Have them tailored.

75
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,080
And that means that I am going to have them fixed so they fit me properly.

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Exactly.

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
This is a lot more common right now.

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,880
Okay, so we're going to be tailoring clothes.

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Now if any of you have ever been to the tailor, what they do is they measure you.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
And what do they measure?

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Well, in this case, they get the width of your shoulders.

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,800
What's really great about these upcoming words is that they're useful in math as well.

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,840
Math and basic measurements.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,800
So width is how big something is across.

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
How wide something is.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Exactly.

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Wide, width.

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay, so that's the width.

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,440
Now your shoulders, they are wide.

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,640
And well, your legs on the other hand, your legs and arms, you don't measure the width

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,560
usually, you measure the length.

92
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,200
How long they are.

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,240
Okay, so width and length.

94
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,800
Now just to throw it in there, this wasn't in the dialogue, but what would be the other

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
measure word?

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,280
So the third word would be height.

97
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,440
So you think of a rectangle, you have the width, how wide something is, the length,

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
how long it is, and the height, how tall it is.

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,160
How tall it is, right.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,640
So width, length, and height.

101
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
All right.

102
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Now that we've measured our arms and legs, now we want to measure our waist.

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay, this is the important one.

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,640
This is also the sensitive one.

105
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,280
If you find that you've gained some weight, we measure the waist.

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Okay, that's how big you are around your stomach.

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,800
And so usually we measure this in a circle.

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,240
Okay, so you've heard of a 26 inch waist or a 32 inch waist.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,760
This is the size of your stomach.

110
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Okay, so it's just above your hips, right?

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,680
As you say, it's your stomach.

112
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,760
And well, we've measured the waist.

113
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,120
And now in men especially, they measure the inseam.

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,280
Now this is very particular for tailors and having suits made.

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,320
What is the inseam of your pants?

116
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,440
Well think of the word in, inside.

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,080
This is the inside of your pants.

118
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,520
So from your foot to the middle of your pants where your zipper starts.

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
So that's not the outside length, it's the inside length.

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,800
Now for example, skirts, they don't have inseams, right?

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,120
No, because there's no inside, there's no middle.

122
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,200
So it's just like a circle.

123
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,480
But in pants or shorts, you have an inseam.

124
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,560
That's where it's connected in the middle.

125
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,840
All right, so also in shorts, very interesting.

126
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,360
So you can measure the inseam of pants or shorts.

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,880
All right, so very interesting and particular words for tailors.

128
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:53,480
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

129
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,840
Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
What can I do for you today?

131
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,600
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Sure we do.

133
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
We have the best tailors in the country.

134
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,760
What is it that you need exactly?

135
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,120
Well, I'm looking to get a custom made suit.

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Excellent.

137
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,680
We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.

138
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,120
How about we get you measured?

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,680
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

140
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,640
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

141
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,880
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

142
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,120
My neck gets easily irritated.

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
No problem.

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,860
Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

145
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,840
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

146
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,760
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

147
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Okay.

148
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,040
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

149
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Please follow me.

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Alright, we're back.

151
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,120
So now we have three key phrases that we found in this dialogue.

152
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
So let's take a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

153
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,980
Fluency Builder.

154
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,200
This first phrase is the topic of today's lesson.

155
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,600
We talked a little bit about measurements for a suit, but in particular we're getting

156
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,720
a custom made suit.

157
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Okay.

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,360
So this word custom made.

159
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,040
Well, custom is important, it means special or unique.

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
There's no other like it.

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
So we could talk about custom cars.

162
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,120
That means a car that has been fixed especially for you.

163
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Okay.

164
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
So a custom made suit would be a suit that was made specifically for your height, for

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
how big your waist is, etc.

166
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Specifically for you.

167
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Right.

168
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,720
So a suit that I buy at the department store is just a normal suit.

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,320
But a suit that I have made for me is a custom made suit.

170
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Okay.

171
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,200
So as you said, you can use it for cars, a custom made car, or maybe for example, a custom

172
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,480
made.

173
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Custom made kitchen.

174
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,680
That means that you get to pick every single part of the kitchen that you want.

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Many people do that, right?

176
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,320
They have custom built or custom made homes.

177
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah, that's always something I've wanted to do, but I hear that it's much more expensive

178
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,960
than getting a normal homemade.

179
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
All right.

180
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,120
So that's the first key phrase.

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,640
Now moving on, when we talk about measuring, we say, I measured.

182
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,560
I measured the length of this street.

183
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Right.

184
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
Or let's measure you so we can see how big you are.

185
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,120
But if you notice in the dialogue, we use the passive voice.

186
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,160
He says, let's get you measured.

187
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay.

188
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,880
I got measured or it got measured.

189
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,000
To get measured, as you say, is the passive voice.

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,440
Now what's the difference between passive and active?

191
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
All right.

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,720
So basically what happens here is we are concentrating on the person and the action falling upon

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
you, for example.

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
So I got measured.

195
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
What happened to me?

196
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
I got measured.

197
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Who did it?

198
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Who measured you?

199
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
We don't know.

200
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
We don't know.

201
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
We don't care.

202
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Right.

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
All right.

204
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
The point, the important part is that you were measured.

205
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,240
You got measured, but we could have a different phrase.

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:54,120
We say, for example, I will measure this table or he measures the height of the door and

207
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,480
we know he measures.

208
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
I will measure.

209
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,080
We know who the actor is.

210
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,660
That means it's active voice because the focus is on who's doing this action.

211
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,720
And in passive voice, the important thing is who is receiving the action.

212
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Right.

213
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Now it's a little bit complicated because as you can see, measured is in the past, but

214
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,040
we're not really talking about the past.

215
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
So it may get a little bit complicated.

216
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,960
We can take a more in-depth look at that in the community section.

217
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
You can ask a couple of questions.

218
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,080
We'll place a couple of examples, but it's kind of hard to get into the grammar over

219
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
an audio podcast, right?

220
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
That's true.

221
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,680
So that's why we have the practice space on the website.

222
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
All right.

223
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,600
So moving on, we have our last phrase.

224
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,400
And when he was talking about the waist and how he should leave a little bit of extra

225
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,000
room, it's because he tends to gain a few pounds.

226
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

227
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,920
So to gain a few pounds is like gaining a kilo.

228
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,360
It means to gain weight over the holidays.

229
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,820
And in this case, to tend to, I tend to means I normally or I usually.

230
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,200
So for example, Marco, what do you tend to eat for breakfast?

231
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,040
I tend to eat scrambled eggs and a glass of yogurt.

232
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
That's healthy.

233
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,640
Do you tend to run late in the morning?

234
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Yes.

235
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
True.

236
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Right.

237
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,320
So tend to, it's a tendency, is what usually happens.

238
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
It's normal.

239
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
It's normal.

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
All right.

241
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,280
So very interesting phrases, very interesting words.

242
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:31,480
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

243
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
Welcome to Bill's Fabric World.

244
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,280
What can I do for you today?

245
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,560
I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes.

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Sure we do.

247
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
We have the best tailors in the country.

248
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,680
What is it that you need exactly?

249
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,120
Well, I'm looking to get a custom made suit.

250
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Excellent.

251
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,600
We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.

252
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,040
How about we get you measured?

253
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,080
Let's start off by measuring the width of your shoulders.

254
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,960
Now let's measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here.

255
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,220
Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar?

256
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,440
My neck gets easily irritated.

257
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
No problem.

258
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,400
Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and the inseam.

259
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area.

260
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,320
I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

261
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Okay.

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design.

263
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
Please follow me.

264
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
All right.

265
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,960
So we talked earlier about how most people buy their clothes at a department store or

266
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,120
a clothing store.

267
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
Have you seen much of this?

268
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,520
You know, maybe back in Ecuador it's more common than in America.

269
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,680
Yeah.

270
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Usually people just go to a department store and get suits for example, but it's actually

271
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,640
very common as well because it's kind of in their artisans to be like a shoemaker or to

272
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,280
be a tailor.

273
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,600
So actually people like it more and go to tailors because they kind of become renowned

274
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,720
like, oh, he used to make suits for the president.

275
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
So you know, people really, really like to get suits made there and obviously they fit

276
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
much better.

277
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
You feel more comfortable.

278
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
And you look better.

279
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Yeah.

280
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,440
As I've said before, you know, I see people who buy all these suits.

281
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,600
My brother, for example, they never quite fit right.

282
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
You can tell it's a little too big in the shoulders.

283
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,000
My brother's tall, so his pants are always a little bit too short.

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,120
But when you come to a place like China and most people can get these suits made for them,

285
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
they just look fabulous.

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,800
It looks very, very nice.

287
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Yeah.

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,600
So maybe you guys can tell us if you've ever had anything tailor made, not only guys' suits,

289
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,000
but girls also get tailor made dresses, tailor made blouses.

290
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,080
I always get coats made actually because my shoulders are broad and so it's hard for me

291
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
to find coats that fit right.

292
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,560
But if I get one custom made, it looks really good.

293
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Right.

294
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,280
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

295
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Leave your questions and comments there and we'll see you guys later.

296
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Until next time, guys.

297
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Bye.

298
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:09,360
Man that hit.
