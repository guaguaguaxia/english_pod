00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,560
Welcome back to another great lesson here with EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,640
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,320
And today we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
A special lesson about the new president.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,400
It's been a hot topic in the US, the new president elect, President Obama.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
Yes.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,000
So today we're bringing you something that you might see at his inaugural address.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's true.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,040
So Marco, can you explain this word, inaugural address?

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,640
The inaugural address is the first speech the president gives at the ceremony when he

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,560
is officially president.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Okay.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
All right.

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,440
So it's his first presidential speech.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Exactly.

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Great.

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,000
So let's take a look at some other words that we're going to find in the dialogue today

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
in vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
All right.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,800
On vocabulary preview today we have two words.

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,080
The first one is swear in.

26
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,720
Swear in.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,880
Swear in.

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,240
Swear in.

29
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,640
We'll see this word in its past tense in the dialogue, right?

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Sworn in.

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Sworn in.

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,480
So it means?

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,840
So to swear someone in is to officially give that person a very important position.

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
Right.

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Usually in government.

36
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,440
And our second word is oath.

38
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
Oath.

39
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
Oath.

40
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,200
O-A-T-H, oath.

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,080
And oath goes hand in hand with swear in, right?

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
That's right.

43
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,640
When you swear someone in, they make an oath.

44
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
A promise, right?

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
A promise.

46
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,440
An official promise to carry out the duties of that job.

47
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Right.

48
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,800
So they promise that they will do their job.

49
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay, great.

50
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,480
So now let's listen to our dialogue for a first time.

51
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Where are we?

52
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,520
Well, we're actually watching a news reporter on TV.

53
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,440
She's in Washington and she's going to tell us all about what's happening.

54
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Great.

55
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
So let's listen.

56
00:01:49,440 --> 00:02:05,960
This is Madeline Wright for BCC News reporting live from Washington, DC, where very shortly

57
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,280
the new president will deliver his inaugural address.

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,840
Just moments ago, the president was sworn into office following the United States Constitution.

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,240
The president swore an oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency.

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,560
And what exactly is going on now, Madeline?

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,040
Well, Tom, true to American tradition, the band has just played Hail to the Chief and

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,520
the president has been honored with a 21-gun salute.

63
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,720
Now we're waiting for the president to take the stage and deliver his speech.

64
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,000
Tom, it's like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill, with dignitaries

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,920
representing several different countries.

66
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,880
What's the mood on the ground like, Madeline?

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
In a word, the mood here is electric.

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
The excitement in the air is palpable.

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,520
I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,840
The audience is shouting, crying, and embracing each other.

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
On this, a most historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,120
The 20th of January will go down in history as the...

73
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh, Tom, it looks like the president is about to begin.

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:17,800
My fellow Americans, I stand before you today...

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Okay, some technical problems at the inaugural address.

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,240
Yeah, I certainly hope this doesn't happen.

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,640
Well, if it does, you heard it first at EnglishPod.

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
Predictors of the future here.

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,960
Okay, let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

80
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,240
Language Takeaway.

81
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,960
On Language Takeaway today, we're bringing you four words.

82
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,280
The first word is deliver.

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Deliver.

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Deliver.

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,560
Like, deliver a pizza.

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,640
No.

87
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Let's listen.

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,440
We've got three examples that will show the meaning of this word.

89
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,200
Example one.

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,220
Who's going to deliver the welcome speech?

91
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,280
Example two.

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,840
I've been asked to deliver a presentation on the findings of our research project.

93
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,600
Example three.

94
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Dr. Rosen is delivering a lecture on macroeconomics.

95
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,800
Okay, so deliver a speech.

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Say a speech.

97
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
To say a speech.

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Yeah.

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,960
So you wouldn't say say a speech, you would say deliver a speech.

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Exactly.

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Okay.

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,720
The next word for Language Takeaway, the who's who.

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,320
The who's who.

104
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
The who's who.

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,920
So this is a funny expression, hey?

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,280
It's kind of weird.

107
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,680
The who's who is the important people in a particular field, right?

108
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Right.

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,120
So, for example, there was a party last night and the who's who of the film industry was

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
there.

111
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,080
Whoa, so all the important stars and directors.

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Yeah.

113
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Okay.

114
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,200
So you would say the funeral was like a who's who of the political world.

115
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,920
Okay, so all the important political figures were at this funeral.

116
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Exactly.

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,960
Let's move to our third word, Dignitaries.

118
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Dignitaries.

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Dignitaries.

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Dignitaries.

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,720
Okay, we have some great examples so you can understand what this word means.

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,640
So let's listen.

123
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Example one.

124
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,080
Several important dignitaries were present at the opening ceremony, including the President

125
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,200
of Brazil, the King of Spain, and the Pope.

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,680
Example two.

127
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,040
There are going to be a lot of foreign dignitaries at the dinner.

128
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,120
So basically we can understand that dignitaries are really important people, right?

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Right.

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Important political or religious figures.

131
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I see.

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,240
All right, now our last word for language takeaway, palpable.

133
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Palpable.

134
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Palpable.

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Palpable.

136
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,600
When something is palpable, it's so strong you can feel it.

137
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Okay, so it's a very strong feeling.

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
You can almost touch it.

139
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah, like the excitement was palpable or the fear was palpable.

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,520
Okay, interesting word, palpable.

141
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,200
Let's listen to our dialogue again and now let's try and listen to all these words we

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,800
just talked about.

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:35,400
This is Madeline Wright for BCC News reporting live from Washington, D.C., where very shortly

144
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,720
the new president will deliver his inaugural address.

145
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Just moments ago, the president was sworn into office following the United States Constitution.

146
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,680
The president swore an oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency.

147
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
And what exactly is going on now, Madeline?

148
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,480
Well, Tom, true to American tradition, the band has just played Hail to the Chief and

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,960
the president has been honored with a 21-gun salute.

150
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,400
Now we're waiting for the president to take the stage and deliver his speech.

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Tom is like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill with dignitaries

152
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,360
representing several different countries.

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,320
What's the mood on the ground like, Madeline?

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,480
In a word, the mood here is electric.

155
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,800
The excitement in the air is palpable.

156
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,960
I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

157
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,280
The audience is shouting, crying and embracing each other.

158
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,920
On this, a most historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,520
The 20th of January will go down in history as the...

160
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,560
Oh, Tom, it looks like the president is about to begin.

161
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:44,160
My fellow Americans, I stand before you today.

162
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,960
Okay, so if you noticed in our dialogue, we have some really interesting phrases there.

163
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Yes.

164
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,160
So I think it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

165
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Fluency Builder.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,240
On Fluency Builder today, we're going to be looking at three phrases that are very interesting

167
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,520
because we can change them a little bit and form different patterns.

168
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Yeah.

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,040
So the first phrase we have is, in a word.

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
In a word.

171
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
In a word.

172
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
In a word.

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,000
We use this expression when we want to describe something in one word.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Right.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Pretty simple, hey?

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's really simple.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Let's look at the pattern.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,960
We've got examples of how you could use this phrase.

179
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Example one.

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,280
In a word, the situation is serious.

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,120
Example two.

182
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,660
What's it like there?

183
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,160
In a word, it's amazing.

184
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,760
Okay, so in a word, this podcast is...

185
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Awesome.

186
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Amazing.

187
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Uh-huh.

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Okay.

189
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Okay, let's look at our second phrase today.

190
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Go down in history.

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Go down in history.

192
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,920
Go down in history.

193
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,480
So this is a really common phrase.

194
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,360
I'm sure you guys have heard it.

195
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,160
Yeah, basically something that is really important that everyone will remember for a very long

196
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
time.

197
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,080
Let's look at this pattern with a few examples.

198
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,480
Example one.

199
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:25,240
This is going to go down in history as the worst disaster the world has ever seen.

200
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Example two.

201
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:38,680
He'll go down in history as the best president we've ever had.

202
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,640
Example three.

203
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,160
This day will go down in history.

204
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,680
Okay, so as you can see, the pattern is we're using a superlative.

205
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
That's right.

206
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
The most.

207
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
The worst.

208
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
The worst.

209
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
The worst, right?

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
And our final phrase in putting it together is...

211
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,580
My fellow Americans.

212
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,320
My fellow Americans.

213
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
My fellow Americans.

214
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
So obviously you can change this one up a little bit, hey?

215
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Right.

216
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,440
You can say my fellow co-workers.

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,660
My fellow citizens.

218
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,520
My fellow family members.

219
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,880
Yes.

220
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,520
So basically fellow just means like dear.

221
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah.

222
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
In some way.

223
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,840
Well, similar.

224
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Similar.

225
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah.

226
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,400
So we looked at some great vocabulary and phrases and now let's talk a little bit about

227
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,480
these American traditions when electing a new president.

228
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes.

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,920
Today in the studio we have JP who's joining us.

230
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Hi everyone.

231
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Hey JP.

232
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
And he's going to be talking to us about these traditions.

233
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Oh, I am?

234
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Okay.

235
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Yeah.

236
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
What are we going to talk about?

237
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
21 gun salute.

238
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
What's that all about?

239
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,600
The 21 gun salute is the military salute where they say, and now we will have the 21 gun

240
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,760
salute.

241
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,840
So 21 soldiers with their rifles, they go, and they all shoot them off at the same time.

242
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
And I don't know why.

243
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,520
I think it's a sign of respect, hey?

244
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Yeah.

245
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Weird respect though.

246
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Well, I think in Europe they would do a cannon or something.

247
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Oh, a cannon salute?

248
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,840
No, well, just cannons.

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
Maybe just one cannon.

250
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,320
Maybe our European listeners know the answer to this.

251
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Maybe.

252
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Okay.

253
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
And what about this song Hail to the Chief?

254
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
Do you know anything about that?

255
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,160
I do not know anything about it except that it's a march and I think it's Souza.

256
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,880
I think John Philip Souza wrote it.

257
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,320
And whenever the president walks into a room, they play that song.

258
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Really?

259
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Yes.

260
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
And I played it once for President Bush, the first one.

261
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
I was a drummer.

262
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
You did?

263
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,840
And my marching band had to play that song for him.

264
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Oh my God, JP, you're like famous.

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Yeah.

266
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,160
This was back in like 1986 or something.

267
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,640
Was that even an election year?

268
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
88?

269
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Yeah.

270
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,920
Well, you did play for the president, so you know.

271
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
That's pretty cool.

272
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah.

273
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,840
So JP, do you have any other sort of traditional things that happen when the president becomes

274
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
the president?

275
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,320
Well, I can tell you that Jimmy Carter, you know, when he was elected president, his motorcade

276
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,760
was going down Pennsylvania Avenue and he stopped the car and got out.

277
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Really?

278
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
To do what?

279
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Yeah.

280
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
To walk.

281
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
He wanted to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

282
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,920
He wanted to walk down the, you know, down the street.

283
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
To be with the people?

284
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah, I think so.

285
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,080
And I think it made the Secret Service insane.

286
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Maybe the car smelled bad or something.

287
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Maybe so.

288
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,240
I think that is my memory of it.

289
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,040
I might be confusing with the West Wing, but I'm not sure.

290
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Too much TV.

291
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Yeah, maybe.

292
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,560
But when the president walks, it's a big deal.

293
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,240
So JP, do you do anything special for the inauguration ceremony?

294
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,180
I always take the day off to watch.

295
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
You do?

296
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
I love watching it.

297
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,520
I love, you know, the swearing in ceremony, the ritual of it, the speech.

298
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,800
All right, everyone, we're out of time.

299
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,320
I hope you enjoyed this political lesson.

300
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,440
I hope you have a happy inauguration day.

301
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Happy inauguration day, everyone.

302
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah.

303
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Okay.

304
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,560
All right, great.

305
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,080
We're definitely going to take the day off to watch it with JP.

306
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,200
And hopefully you guys can too.

307
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Well, thanks for listening, everyone.

308
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
And until next time, goodbye.

309
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:33,380
Bye.
