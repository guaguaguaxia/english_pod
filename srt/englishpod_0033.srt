00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,660
And today we have another great elementary lesson for you all.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,680
That's right, we've got a lesson for all you sports fans out there.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,040
Right, we're doing a podcast on sports today.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
We're starting off with basketball.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,640
So we've got lots of language about basketball and sports in this lesson today.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,760
Great, so let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,360
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,440
Two words for you today.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,480
The first one is foul.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Foul.

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Foul.

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
A foul.

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,200
Basically, it's an action in a game that is not allowed.

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,880
Right, so if you're playing basketball and you kick the other player.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
That's a foul.

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
That's a foul.

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
That's a pretty big foul.

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,520
Yeah, if you're playing soccer and you pick up the ball.

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
That's also a foul.

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Uh-huh.

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,160
Our second word is ref.

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,360
Ref, R-E-F.

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,040
Also known as a referee.

28
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
Right?

29
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,800
So a referee is.

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Basically, like the judge of a game.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The judge of the game.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
So he's the one that will.

33
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Say that was a foul.

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
That was a foul, exactly.

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,560
Ref, also known as referee.

36
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
Okay, so two great words.

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,520
We're gonna hear them in our dialogue and we're going to be listening to two guys who

38
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,320
are watching a basketball game on TV.

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:32,440
Hey, has the game started yet?

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Oh, who's winning?

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Bulls, of course.

43
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
What?

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
That wasn't a foul.

45
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Oh, come on, ref.

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Don't worry.

47
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Shaq always screws up free throws.

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
You were right.

49
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
He didn't make the shot.

50
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Yeah, that was a great shot.

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Three pointer, yeah.

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Did you see that?

53
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
He traveled to the ref.

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Didn't even call it.

55
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
This ref needs glasses.

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Hey, ref, open your eyes.

57
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Can't believe you didn't see that.

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Okay, end of the first quarter.

59
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
All right, I'm going to make a beer run.

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:18,920
All right, a really common situation whenever you're watching games with friends, right?

61
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
You need to get a beer.

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,160
We'll talk about that in a little while.

63
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,040
Let's take a look at language takeaway.

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Language takeaway.

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Okay, let's take a look at our first word on language takeaway.

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Free throw.

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Free throw.

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Free throw.

69
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Free throw.

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
This one's a bit hard to say, isn't it?

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,280
It's a little bit hard to explain, but if you're playing basketball and if someone fouls

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,760
you, you get a free throw.

73
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,680
So that's when all the players line up around you and you can throw the ball.

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,080
To the basket without anyone blocking you or anything.

75
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Right.

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,960
A little bit complicated, but I'm sure the basketball fans understand what a free throw

77
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
is.

78
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,000
All right, our next word is...

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Make the shot.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Make the shot.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Make the shot.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Let's listen to some examples and we'll understand the meaning of make the shot.

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Example one.

84
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
I can't believe it.

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,480
He made the shot from the other side of the court.

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Example two.

87
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,760
There's no way he's going to make that shot.

88
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,280
He's way too far away from the net.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Example three.

90
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,760
If Gretzky makes this shot, they're going to win the Stanley Cup.

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,400
So it's clear now to make the shot is to successfully put the ball in the basket.

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
You can use this expression in other sports as well, right?

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah, you can use it in hockey to make the shot.

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,920
You could also use it in golf and a lot of different sports that use the term to shoot.

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Yes.

96
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Shoot the ball.

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,600
So anytime you shoot the ball, you can make the shot.

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Exactly.

99
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,560
Okay, our next word today, three pointer.

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
Three pointer.

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Three pointer.

102
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,200
A three pointer.

103
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,040
It's a shot in basketball when you get three points.

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Yes.

105
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,120
Usually this shot is taken from further out.

106
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
Yeah, a farther distance.

107
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah, so it's a little bit more difficult to make this shot.

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,720
You know, sometimes people might say a three point shot or something like that, but our

109
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,240
EnglishPod learners, they know.

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
It's a three pointer.

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Yeah, you'll sound really knowledgeable, really cool using that one.

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,280
Three pointer.

113
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,120
And our last word today, travel.

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Travel.

115
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
To travel.

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Travel.

117
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
When you walk with the basketball.

118
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,720
Well technically, you're allowed to take two steps in basketball.

119
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Okay.

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
So when you take more than two steps, then it's traveling.

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Yes.

122
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,200
So yeah, traveling means to take more than two steps with the ball.

123
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,440
Let's listen to the dialogue a second time.

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,160
This time it'll be a bit slower so that we can understand some of these great phrases

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
we just talked about.

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Hey, has the game started yet?

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,520
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

128
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,600
Oh, who's winning?

129
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
The Bulls, of course.

130
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
What?

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
That wasn't a foul.

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,760
Oh, come on, ref.

133
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Don't worry.

134
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,320
Shaq always screws up free throws.

135
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,120
Yeah, you were right.

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,160
He didn't make the shot.

137
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,440
Yeah, that was a great shot.

138
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Three pointer, yeah.

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,640
Oh, did you see that?

140
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,480
He traveled and the ref didn't even call it.

141
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,080
This ref needs glasses.

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,800
Hey, ref, open your eyes.

143
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,880
I can't believe you didn't see that.

144
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Okay.

145
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,600
End of the first quarter.

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,320
Hey, I'm going to make a beer run.

147
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Sweet.

148
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,920
All right, sports fans.

149
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,080
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

150
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Fluency Builder.

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,500
Okay, today on Fluency Builder, we have two really common words that you would listen

152
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
to while you're watching a game.

153
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, these are sort of slangy words, hey?

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Yeah, they're kind of a common...

155
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Like informal.

156
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Informal.

157
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,480
The first one that we have is screw up.

159
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Screw up.

160
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Screw up.

161
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,480
To screw up.

162
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Yeah, so this is a good way of saying...

163
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,360
To make a mistake.

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Mm-hmm.

165
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Let's listen to some examples of how this word is used.

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
Example one.

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,600
Jill, you really screwed up this time.

168
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,320
You're fired.

169
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,440
Example two.

170
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,640
This game is important.

171
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,840
If you screw it up, we're out of the finals.

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Example three.

173
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
I know I screwed up.

175
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Will you forgive me?

176
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Okay, so screw up is mess up.

177
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Yeah, make a mistake.

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Make a mistake.

179
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Uh-huh.

180
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,160
Great, and our last word on Fluency Builder today, a beer run.

181
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,800
A beer run.

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Beer run.

183
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,880
So what is this beer run?

184
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,920
You run to get beer.

185
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,400
You go to the store and get beer.

186
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Get more beer.

187
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,760
Okay, so it's just an expression meaning to go and get more beer.

188
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah, usually you're watching a game or you're at home with your friends, you run out of

189
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,400
beer so somebody has to...

190
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Go get some beer.

191
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Go get some beer.

192
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Make a beer run.

193
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Yeah.

194
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,280
Hey, has the game started yet?

195
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,760
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

196
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,880
Who's winning?

197
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Bulls, of course.

198
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
What?

199
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,440
That wasn't a foul.

200
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh, come on, ref.

201
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Don't worry.

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Shaq always screws up free throws.

203
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
You were right.

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,800
He didn't make the shot.

205
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,280
Yeah, that was a great shot.

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Three-pointer, yeah.

207
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Did you see that?

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
He traveled to the ref.

209
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Didn't even call it.

210
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
This ref needs glasses.

211
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Hey, ref, open your eyes.

212
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,680
I can't believe you didn't see that.

213
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,880
Okay, end of the first quarter.

214
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,080
All right, I'm going to make a beer run.

215
