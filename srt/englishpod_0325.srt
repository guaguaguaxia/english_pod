00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,520
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,000
And today at EnglishPod, we have a lesson for you about small talk.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,280
We continue with our series about short casual conversations you may have with your friends,

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,600
somebody you haven't seen in a long time, or maybe even a co-worker.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
That's right.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
So in today's dialogue, we're going to listen to two people who work in the same building.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,760
They're going to talk a little bit about travel, right Marco?

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Yeah.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,960
And a little bit about recommending a place to go on vacation, maybe Europe.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,880
And so we're going to have some great phrases as to speaking of this topic very briefly

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
with a friend.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
All right.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Let's listen to today's dialogue.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Hey, Michelle.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,920
Good to see you.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Are you at lunch?

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Oh, hi, Jim.

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,760
No, I just got back.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,480
I thought you were on vacation now.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,400
No, I wish I was.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,760
I just got back from Spain, actually.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,280
Oh, wonderful.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,980
Have you been there before or was it your first time?

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,980
My first time.

28
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,000
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,520
It was amazing and the weather was just beautiful.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,280
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
I'm so jealous of you.

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,560
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,760
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

34
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,960
Well, I really recommend Spain.

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,560
You really should go.

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,000
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,240
This is my floor.

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,480
Speak again soon, I hope.

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
For sure.

40
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Take care.

41
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
All right.

42
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
We're back.

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,360
So, now, let's take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Language Takeaway.

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
All right.

46
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,520
In Language Takeaway, we've got a couple of words and phrases for you.

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
The first one is, I just got back.

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,320
So, to get back from somewhere, Marco.

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,480
That's right, Jim.

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,640
Just got back from Europe.

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,720
And when you say, I just got back, is I recently or very recently returned from somewhere.

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
That's right.

53
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,320
To get back from somewhere means to return from that place.

54
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,680
So, in this dialogue, Jim just got back from Spain.

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,000
Michelle just got back from lunch.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,040
This means to return from somewhere.

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
That's right.

58
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,320
So, it can be a place, not only a country, but it can be, for example, the office.

59
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,760
I just got back from work.

60
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,360
Or I just got back from football practice.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
That's why I'm very sweaty.

62
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Right.

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
So, this obviously means that you are now not in the same place where you just got back

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
from.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, I'm from America.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
I went to Spain on vacation and I just got back from Spain.

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
That means I'm in America again.

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah, exactly.

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,600
You're not still in Spain.

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
No.

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
All right.

72
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
So, that's for our first word.

73
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,280
Now, let's go on.

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
And Michelle said, oh, I'm so jealous of you.

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
All right.

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,000
Jealous is an adjective and a very, very common one.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can use it in many different circumstances.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,200
It means to want what someone else has.

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
That's right.

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,640
So, in this case, Michelle is jealous that Jim went on vacation.

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,160
So, she wishes she could go on vacation.

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
That's right.

83
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm so jealous of you.

84
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,080
Or if you see someone who has a new pair of shoes and you like the shoes because you don't

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,600
have them, you can say, I'm so jealous.

86
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
I love your shoes.

87
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
That's right.

88
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,920
And if you're jealous, you say, I am jealous.

89
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,800
Or if you're jealous of a person, you say, I am jealous of you.

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,920
And so, they were ending their conversation and Jim said, you know what?

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,760
It's been great to catch up with you.

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
All right.

93
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,320
This is a really important phrase, to catch up.

94
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
It means two different things.

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,080
And we're going to talk about one meaning here today.

96
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,280
To catch up with someone, like to talk to them about what they've been doing recently,

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,120
means to learn about their life because maybe you haven't talked in a long time.

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
That's right.

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,240
So, maybe you haven't seen your friend in two years and you go out for dinner to catch

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,960
up, to talk about what has happened in your life recently.

101
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
That's right.

102
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,600
Or if you see a friend on the street and you know that you haven't seen him or her in a

103
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,640
long time, you can make a date to catch up.

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
So, hey Marco, I haven't seen you in months.

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,340
Let's catch up sometime soon.

106
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
That's right.

107
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,520
And that means to share information and to find out how you have been recently.

108
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Exactly.

109
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
All right.

110
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,280
Now, when he was getting out of the elevator, he said, this is my floor.

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,800
Now, we know floor, but my floor, what is this?

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
My floor, your floor, whose floor?

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Right.

114
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
This doesn't make much sense, does it?

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,360
Well, actually floor here means that this is the floor that I work on or the floor that

116
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I live on.

117
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,920
It means the place I'm going to.

118
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Right.

119
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,560
So, we know floor, the ground beneath our feet in a building.

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,200
But in this case, we're talking about one of the levels of a building.

121
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,080
So, maybe the sixth floor.

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
That's right.

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,320
So, if I'm in my apartment building in the elevator, I can say, oh, stop the elevator.

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
This is my floor.

125
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,360
I want to get off the elevator.

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Right.

127
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
This is where I live.

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
All right.

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
So, a lot of great stuff there.

130
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,240
Why don't we take a break and listen to the dialogue again?

131
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,520
Hey, Michelle.

132
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,200
Good to see you.

133
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Are you at lunch?

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh, hi, Jim.

135
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
No, I just got back.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
I thought you were on vacation now.

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,640
No, I wish I was.

138
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,000
I just got back from Spain, actually.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,520
Oh, wonderful.

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,220
Have you been there before or was it your first time?

141
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,220
My first time.

142
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,240
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this is my first time to Spain.

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,760
It was amazing and the weather was just beautiful.

144
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,520
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

145
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm so jealous of you.

146
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,800
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, I really recommend Spain.

149
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
You really should go.

150
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,240
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

151
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
This is my floor.

152
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
Speak again soon, I hope.

153
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
For sure.

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Take care.

155
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,160
All right, we're back.

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,720
So, now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

157
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
Fluency Builder.

158
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,160
So, there are some keys to these small talk conversations and they are definitely the

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
phrases.

160
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,480
The first one we have here is, good to see you.

161
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,320
So, Jim says, hey, Michelle, good to see you.

162
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
That's right.

163
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,520
So, we've chosen this phrase because it's very casual and very common to use as a polite

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
way of saying, hey, how are you?

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Good to see you.

166
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm actually showing you that I'm happy that I am talking to you.

167
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,920
So, this is a very flexible phrase.

168
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,840
You can say it at the beginning of a conversation when you just see someone, hey, Marco, good

169
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
to see you.

170
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Or at the end, you can say, it was very good to see you.

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
I hope to see you again soon.

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
That's right.

173
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,160
So, maybe you can use it at the beginning if you just begin to talk to someone or if

174
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,200
you're saying goodbye, you can say, well, you know what?

175
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,960
I have to go now, but it's been good to see you.

176
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,880
So, very flexible phrase.

177
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
That's right.

178
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
That's right.

179
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Now, when Michelle thought that Jim was on vacation, Jim said, no, no, no.

180
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,840
I wish I was.

181
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
All right.

182
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I wish I was.

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,920
I thought you were on vacation.

184
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,040
So, she thought that he was still on vacation in Spain.

185
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,680
And he says, well, I'm not because, you know, here I am, but I wish I was.

186
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,800
I wish I was in Spain right now because Spain is so nice.

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
That's right.

188
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,920
So, it may seem a little bit strange, but it's actually completing the idea.

189
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,680
And basically, we're using the verb to be because that's the question.

190
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,080
Are you on vacation?

191
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,280
No, I wish I was on vacation.

192
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,040
So, that means he's not, but he wants to be.

193
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
That's right.

194
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,560
Okay, so now, he actually had to get going and he used this exact phrase.

195
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
He said, I must be going.

196
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
I must be going.

197
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,920
Now, remember this as a phrase.

198
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,400
This is a good way to end a conversation.

199
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,960
Maybe you have to go to work.

200
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,500
Maybe you have your kids at home.

201
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,760
You have to take them somewhere.

202
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,920
So, you say, I'm really sorry, I must be going, but let's see each other again soon.

203
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
That's right.

204
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
So, you are politely ending the conversation.

205
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,840
You are politely saying, I can't talk to you anymore.

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,480
I must be going now, but it's been great to talk to you.

207
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
That's right.

208
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Very polite.

209
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
So, remember this one.

210
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
It's better than, I'm going now.

211
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
We don't say that.

212
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Yeah, or I have to go.

213
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,720
Well, you can say, I have to go, but it's nice saying, oh, you know what?

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,600
I really like talking to you, but I must be going now.

215
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,840
And Jim also finished by saying, we'll speak again soon.

216
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,120
And Michelle said, for sure.

217
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
For sure.

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,520
Now, Americans particularly love to say this phrase.

219
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,560
For sure means yes, or I agree, or definitely.

220
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Right.

221
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,200
You can use it as an interjection.

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,440
So, if I say, hey, Catherine, am I going to see you later on today?

223
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Yeah, for sure.

224
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
For sure.

225
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
There we go.

226
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,560
So, you're saying yes, absolutely, definitely, for sure.

227
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,640
So, Marco, my birthday is Friday night.

228
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,200
Are you going to come to the party?

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
For sure.

230
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

231
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
All right.

232
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,760
So, that's all we have for today.

233
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,080
Why don't we review everything we've taken a look at now and listen to the dialogue one

234
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,840
last time.

235
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, Michelle.

236
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Good to see you.

237
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Are you at lunch?

238
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Oh, hi, Jim.

239
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,640
No, I just got back.

240
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,360
I thought you were on vacation now.

241
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,280
No, I wish I was.

242
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,760
I just got back from Spain, actually.

243
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, wonderful.

244
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
Have you been there before or was it your first time?

245
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
My first time.

246
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain.

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,400
It was amazing and the weather was just beautiful.

248
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,160
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

249
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm so jealous of you.

250
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,440
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

251
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,640
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

252
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Well, I really recommend Spain.

253
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
You really should go.

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,840
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

255
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
This is my floor.

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
Speak again soon, I hope.

257
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
For sure.

258
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Take care.

259
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
All right.

260
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
So, this was another part of our small talk series.

261
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,300
As you can see, very short, but very useful language used to talk very briefly with someone.

262
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
It always happens.

263
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,520
You meet somebody at the elevator or you just want to talk very quickly.

264
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,920
Yeah, but you don't want to talk about anything that's too personal like someone's politics

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,720
or their religious beliefs or their children because maybe you don't know them very well.

266
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,960
So, these are really great topics to talk about like business trips or vacation or the

267
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,720
weather.

268
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,400
English speakers love to talk about these when they don't know someone that well.

269
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
That's right.

270
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
That's right.

271
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,560
So, if you have any questions or any comments about this lesson or you want to suggest any

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,960
other topics, you can find us at EnglishPod.com.

273
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
We hope to see you all there.

274
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Bye.

275
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
See you guys.

276
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:21,060
I will see you guys later, take care.
