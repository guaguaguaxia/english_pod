00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,460
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,720
My name is Catherine and today we are covering a very important health issue.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
That's right.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,700
We are, that's right, in case of an emergency, maybe somebody stops breathing, so we need

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,980
to apply CPR.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,280
Now what is this procedure?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,360
Well, let's take a look at it in Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:34,200
CPR in English is an acronym that means C, P, and R all stand for different words.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,400
The big phrase here is cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
All right.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,560
So you don't have to remember that.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,080
Well, that's pretty hard.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
What if you break it down?

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,960
So what is cardio?

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,320
Cardio means it has to do with your heart.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
And then pulmonary?

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Pulmonary means lungs.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,700
It has to do with your lungs.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,960
And what about resuscitation?

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,480
That means to bring back.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,440
So to resuscitate is to bring back to life.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
That's right.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Okay.

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,960
So this is a very popular procedure.

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,160
You probably see it in movies when somebody almost drowned, the lifeguard performs CPR.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,480
Oh no, the love of my life has just drowned.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,680
And then someone comes and they push their chest and they say, one, two, three, they

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
count.

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,000
And then the person spits out water and everything and they're like, I always loved you.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All right.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So that's CPR.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,160
Why don't we listen to this dialogue, see what's going on and we'll be back shortly.

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,800
Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,240
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,400
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
That's right.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,400
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
What does that mean?

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,760
Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air, then

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,520
we need to get them going again.

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,480
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Let's begin.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
I need a volunteer.

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Me, me.

46
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,880
All right.

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,400
Come here and lay flat on your back.

48
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,780
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,000
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,640
Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times like

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
this.

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Wait, what are you doing?

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
You're a married woman.

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,680
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,600
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,200
Well, okay.

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,880
No French kissing.

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,960
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

60
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,760
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

62
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,260
Wait, what are you doing?

63
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,200
You can't just kiss me then go for second base.

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
All right, we're back.

65
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,000
So a couple of pretty difficult words and phrases there, but don't worry.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,040
We'll explain them now in Language Takeaway.

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,320
Language Takeaway.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,240
The first phrase we've got today is cardiac arrest.

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,640
All right, so cardiac arrest.

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,800
Now cardiac, I think that has to do with the heart again, right?

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,160
Exactly, your heart.

72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
And what about arrest?

73
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,660
Well, arrest means two things.

74
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,640
Maybe you've heard of this meaning to arrest somebody, the police arrested someone.

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Well, this means to stop.

76
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,040
So we're not talking about the police here.

77
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,600
We're talking about the heart stopping.

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
So cardiac arrest means when your heart stops.

79
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,160
Okay, and another word that's right next to it, pulmonary arrest.

80
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,840
So I'm guessing again, pulmonary has to do with lungs and arrest stops so your lungs

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,680
stop pumping air.

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Exactly.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,400
So cardiac and pulmonary arrest, these are two times when your heart or your lungs, they

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
stop doing what they are supposed to do.

85
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,880
All right, and interestingly enough, the heart pumps blood, the lungs pump air, and that's

86
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
our next word.

87
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,500
What is this word to pump?

88
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,920
To pump means to fill something with.

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,840
So for example, the heart pumps blood to the rest of your body.

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,300
That means it's always making sure your body has blood going into it.

91
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,480
And the same thing with your lungs.

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,560
Your lungs help oxygen and air get to the rest of your body.

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,720
So they pump it, they fill up with air.

94
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Okay, and we can do the same in other things.

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
For example, you pump air into your tire.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
That's right.

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,760
If you have a flat tire, you're riding your bicycle and your bicycle won't move.

98
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Oh no, you have to pump it with air.

99
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,440
That means fill it up with air.

100
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,240
Okay, or maybe even pump water, right?

101
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,080
Like in your house.

102
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,040
Or pump your car up with gas.

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Okay.

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
All right, very good.

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,640
So now the man is going to explain how to perform this procedure, CPR, and he asks for

106
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
a volunteer.

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,920
Okay, a volunteer.

108
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,560
This is a word that can be both a noun, so a thing, and it can be an action, a verb.

109
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,840
Okay, so who is or what is a volunteer?

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,080
A volunteer is someone who offers to do something for free.

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,360
For free, without you asking them to do it.

112
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,800
Right, so are there any volunteers in the room?

113
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,080
Right, and somebody says, me, me, me.

114
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,480
Me, me, me, I do.

115
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,720
You can also volunteer to help people who need help.

116
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,040
So for example, in Haiti, there's an earthquake, and there are many people who offered to volunteer

117
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
to help patients.

118
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,880
So that means they said, I will work for free to help these people, a volunteer.

119
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,720
A volunteer, or to volunteer.

120
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Very good.

121
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,560
So now we have our volunteer, and the man is explaining what to do.

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,920
Move the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

123
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
This is a good one.

124
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
So a path is like a road.

125
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,160
It's where something can go, can move.

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,320
To clear a pathway means to make some room.

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,120
To make a clear path.

128
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,520
So that means, think about it, if you can't breathe, someone has to find a way to make

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,060
room to make a hole for you to breathe.

130
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,640
So that means to move whatever is blocking you to clear some kind of space.

131
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,760
So that's a pathway, a clear space.

132
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,720
And now, well he's demonstrating how to perform CPR.

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,400
So what is this verb, to demonstrate?

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,720
To demonstrate is very important.

135
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,120
We use this in most kinds of teaching.

136
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,520
So to demonstrate is to show or to give an example.

137
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Okay.

138
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,680
So for example, here in EnglishPod, we are demonstrating how to use these words in sentences.

139
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Exactly.

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,040
So an example is a good way to demonstrate the word or the phrase.

141
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Very good.

142
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
All right.

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,720
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

145
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

146
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
That's right.

148
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,360
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

149
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
What does that mean?

150
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,720
Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air, then

151
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,480
we need to get them going again.

152
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,440
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Let's begin.

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
I need a volunteer.

155
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Me, me.

156
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
All right.

157
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,960
Come here and lay flat on your back.

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,340
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

159
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,560
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,200
Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times like

161
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
this.

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Wait, what are you doing?

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm a married woman.

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,240
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

165
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

166
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,680
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,720
Well, okay.

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,180
No French kissing.

169
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,280
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

171
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,080
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

172
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,560
Wait, what are you doing?

173
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,200
You can't just kiss me then go for second base.

174
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,840
All right.

175
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,320
We're back so now let's go with Fluency Builder.

176
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Fluency Builder.

177
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, the first phrase in Fluency Builder we hear in the beginning of today's dialogue.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,920
The teacher says, well basically if your heart stops pumping blood, then we need to get it

179
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
going again.

180
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Okay.

181
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,760
So that's a whole phrase there, to get something going, to get it going.

182
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,900
What do you mean by this?

183
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
This means to start it up again.

184
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,000
So we could say, I used to teach an English class for my colleagues but we stopped having

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'd like to get it going again.

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
So you'd like to start it up again.

190
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Exactly.

191
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,800
So usually you're talking about turning something on or getting something started.

192
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,920
For example, maybe your car won't start so if you push it, you can get it going.

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Right.

194
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,840
To get it going or to turn the keys to get it going.

195
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Okay.

196
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Right.

197
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,640
So to get something going.

198
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,520
Now moving on, we have two key phrases here that are a little bit spicy, right?

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,240
Yeah, they're very romantic.

200
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,960
Although this is a CPR class so it shouldn't be very romantic.

201
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
All right.

202
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,800
Well, this phrase that we have coming up is French kiss.

203
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,560
To French kiss someone or a French kiss.

204
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,520
So the volunteer says, okay, I'm happy to help you but no French kissing.

205
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Okay.

206
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,760
So what is French kissing?

207
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,120
No one wants to answer.

208
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
All right.

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
What is it?

210
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,960
It is when you kiss someone but your tongue goes into that other person's mouth.

211
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Ew.

212
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
All right.

213
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
So there's a normal kiss.

214
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,240
You can kiss your friends on the cheek but a French kiss means that you use your tongue.

215
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Okay.

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,260
So I wonder why they call it a French kiss.

217
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,360
Maybe Americans just were too shy.

218
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,000
They blamed it on the French.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,320
Maybe the French listeners out there can tell us.

220
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
All right.

221
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,800
So now moving on and she says, okay, no French kissing.

222
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,120
Now the man is going to perform CPR and obviously he has to firmly press down on her chest to

223
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,840
get her heart pumping blood, right?

224
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Right.

225
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
This is a part of CPR.

226
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,760
So first of all, you try to give the person air so they can breathe and then you have

227
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,680
to push their chest to start their heart.

228
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,520
And this woman, the volunteer says, hey, what are you doing?

229
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,400
You can't just kiss me first and then go for second base.

230
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
All right.

231
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
So what is second base?

232
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Okay.

233
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,800
This is a sports metaphor.

234
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
With baseball, right?

235
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Baseball.

236
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Because baseball has four bases.

237
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,800
First, second, third base and home plate or home base.

238
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Exactly.

239
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,800
So in romance, when we're talking about dating, we have a way to say first, second, third

240
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
and fourth base.

241
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
First base is kissing.

242
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
That's kissing, right?

243
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
So second base, what would be second base?

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Well, in this example, it means touching.

245
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Touching.

246
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Certain parts of the body, right?

247
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Romantic touching.

248
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
All right.

249
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,800
So second base and then obviously we have third and fourth, but we're not going to get

250
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
into that now.

251
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,560
You can look it up on Google, third base and fourth base.

252
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,800
We trust that you can find it.

253
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,160
But first and second base are very common.

254
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,240
It's okay to talk about.

255
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
It's not a bad word.

256
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,320
So you'll probably see it in movies, young kids talking about first base or going to

257
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,520
second base with someone.

258
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,040
So it's kind of saying this in a different way, as a metaphor, as you said.

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,800
It's more polite than talking about.

260
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
It's more subtle.

261
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
All right.

262
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,680
So that's all the words and phrases we have on Fluency Builder.

263
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,800
Let's listen to this great dialogue one last time.

264
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.

265
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,480
First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

266
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,200
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
That's right.

268
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.

269
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
What does that mean?

270
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,520
Well, basically, if your heart stops pumping blood or your lungs stop pumping air, then

271
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,320
we need to get them going again.

272
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,280
That's when we have to apply this procedure.

273
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Let's begin.

274
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
I need a volunteer.

275
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Me.

276
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Me.

277
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
All right.

278
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,200
Come here and lay flat on your back.

279
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,580
Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

280
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,800
We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs.

281
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,440
Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times like

282
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
this.

283
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Wait, what are you doing?

284
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
You're a married woman.

285
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,480
You can't just try to kiss me like that.

286
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,360
Ma'am, I'm not trying to kiss you.

287
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

288
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,960
Well, OK.

289
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,640
No French kissing.

290
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,720
As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner.

291
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,540
Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.

292
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,480
To do this, we place our hands over the person's chest and press down firmly two or three times.

293
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,020
Wait, what are you doing?

294
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,680
You can't just kiss me then go for second base.

295
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
All right.

296
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
We're back.

297
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,480
So a CPR class, this is actually a very popular thing to take up.

298
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,120
You never know when you need to perform it, right?

299
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
That's true.

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,380
I think it's a really smart class to take.

301
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,120
You can usually take them for free at a community center or a fire department.

302
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
The Red Cross.

303
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
The Red Cross.

304
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
I have a Red Cross certification.

305
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Oh, really?

306
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
So you know how to perform this?

307
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Yep.

308
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,560
It's actually, as I said, I think it would be very useful.

309
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,520
I've never taken a course like this up, but I know how to perform the procedure.

310
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm not certified though, so I'm not a certified CPR person.

311
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,200
But it's interesting.

312
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,600
Let us know if in your country maybe you can take CPR classes or maybe you're a CPR certified

313
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
technician.

314
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,840
Or maybe you are trained in other ways, so we're curious about those as well.

315
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,040
Let us know if you have any questions about today's lesson, our website is EnglishPod.com.

316
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
All right, we'll see you guys there.

317
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Bye everyone.

318
00:13:36,040 --> 00:14:04,600
Enjoy 501c3PP0GRS today!
