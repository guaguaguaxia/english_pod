00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,560
My name is Catherine and today we have a very complicated topic for you.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
That's right.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,360
This is an upper intermediate lesson, a little bit more difficult and we're talking all about

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,240
taxes, paychecks and all the information for when you work in the United States.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
That's right.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,320
It confuses me and I'm American.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,040
So take a close listen.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,400
We're going to listen to this dialogue one time and we'll be back in a moment to discuss

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
what's going on.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:38,520
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,840
I have some questions about my paycheck.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
You bet, Emily.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
Pull up a chair.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,760
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
understand.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,800
First off, what is this FICA and SUI SDI tax and why are there deductions both from

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,680
Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,360
OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,040
This number here represents your gross pay.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
Then here we have a series of deductions.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,160
First off are the federal ones.

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,080
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act or something like that.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,840
It's your federal income tax.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,560
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,720
out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
All right, I see.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
That's right.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,680
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,440
There's the state income tax.

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,420
And then this SUI SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,080
disability fund that our state has set up.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,880
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,320
Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that.

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,160
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,320
That's right.

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Not all states have an income tax.

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,000
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I see.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All right.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,400
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,540
Thanks for your help, Susan.

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,760
No problem.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,360
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,400
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,640
I just never paid much attention.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
See you later.

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,760
All right, we're back.

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,960
So obviously a lot of vocab there, a lot of acronyms as well, like FICA and all that stuff.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,880
We'll take a look at that in a little bit.

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,740
First, let's start off with some language on Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,320
Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,240
So when you get paid, there's a very important number you want to look at or a couple of

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
numbers.

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
These are called deductions.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,480
Now, why do deductions make people sad, Marco?

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,160
Because a deduction is to take away or reduce.

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,520
So obviously if your salary is, let's say, $1,000 and you have $500 deductions, then

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
you only get five instead of 1,000.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
All right.

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
So deductions mean what money is being taken away from you.

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
All right.

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,960
So that's money that's deducted for certain taxes or certain programs.

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,440
It's important to remember that deduct, to deduct, is the opposite of to add.

70
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
It means to take away.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
To take away, that's right.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,160
So Emily had some questions about her salary and so she brought her pay stub to Susan to

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,040
ask her, why are all these deductions?

74
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Why am I not getting all my salary?

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
That's right.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,480
So pay stubs are very important pieces of paper.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,360
Basically when you go to a store and you buy something, you get a receipt.

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,520
Well when you go to work and you get paid, you get a receipt for your payment.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,120
That means that it shows you how much money you earn and all of these deductions.

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,600
So if you're paid every month, you get a pay stub every month.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,680
If you're paid every two weeks, you get a pay stub every two weeks.

82
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Okay.

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,200
So it's basically a little receipt that tells you you have been paid and how much you were

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
paid.

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
That's right.

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
All right.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,040
So Susan started explaining about her gross salary and her net salary.

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
All right.

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
And these are the two most important numbers on your pay stub.

90
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,480
On your pay stub it will say gross pay.

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,440
Not gross like icky gross, but like total.

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,320
So in total you earn $1,000 a month, but that's not how much money you have in your bank because

93
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,640
the money that you earn is actually a little bit different because of these deductions

94
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
we mentioned.

95
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,640
So the net pay is the actual amount of money you get to keep.

96
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Right.

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,640
So the company will pay $1,000, but with taxes and all these deductions, the actual money

98
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,880
that you get is less and that's called the net pay.

99
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,800
So it's important when you're looking at these numbers, look at your gross pay.

100
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
Is that correct?

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,620
And then afterwards, look at your net pay.

102
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,120
Is that what money you actually received?

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
That's right.

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
All right.

105
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,100
So now getting into a little bit of taxes and the type of taxes that we have out there.

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,920
Not considering the taxes for the salary, this is a different one.

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,760
We have a property tax.

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
That's right.

109
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,320
So some places in America tax you on the amount of money you earn at your job, but a lot of

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,640
others like to collect taxes from different areas.

111
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
So property tax is one of those.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:31,540
If you own land, if you own a house or a condo, you will pay a property tax every year.

113
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,180
Every year you have to pay for owning this property.

114
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
That's right.

115
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,440
So basically you're paying the state for the land that you have or the space that you have.

116
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,880
And the bigger your house is, the bigger the land is, the more money you pay.

117
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,220
And you have to pay the same value every year or does it change over time?

118
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,760
It can change over time.

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,060
You hear this sometimes, property taxes are, or property value increases and so then property

120
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,160
tax will probably increase as well.

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Okay.

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
And what about sales tax?

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,360
I think this is very straightforward, but how does it work?

124
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Well, it's straightforward, Marco, but I don't think they have this in many other places

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
in the world.

126
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,320
China, for example, we don't really have a sales tax, so people don't have to worry about

127
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
it.

128
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,920
But a sales tax is a small tax that you pay every time you buy something.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Right.

130
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
All right.

131
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,440
If I buy a TV and the TV is $100, it's possible that the sales tax is 3%.

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
I pay $103.

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,720
So that's another way that you are taxed, not on how much money you make, but on the

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,960
purchases that you make.

135
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
That makes sense.

136
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,400
I can buy a lot of cool things, cars, TVs.

137
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm paying more money to my state to provide services like schools and roads and things

138
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
like that.

139
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Okay.

140
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,160
So a lot of interesting things here.

141
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I think we can move on now to specifically talking about the taxes related to people's

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,000
salaries or how it works in the United States.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,560
Remember that we are talking specifically about the United States here.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,760
So let's take a look at that now on Fluency Builder.

145
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Fluency Builder.

146
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,120
All right.

147
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
So one of the scary acronyms here, Marco, was FICA.

148
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
The FICA.

149
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,880
It looks very strange here.

150
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
What is this FICA?

151
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,440
Well, this is an acronym.

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,720
And remember, acronyms are words that stand for other words.

153
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,420
So F, federal, I, insurance, C, contribution, and A, act.

154
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,400
So federal insurance contribution act.

155
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,320
Basically, this is a federal tax.

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,720
That means that it's everyone in the country.

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
Everyone has to pay it, no matter where you live.

158
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Yeah.

159
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,040
Illinois, New York, California, everyone has to pay.

160
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
And how much is this tax?

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Do you know?

162
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I do not know.

163
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,320
It's called a graduated income tax.

164
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,240
That means that people who earn very little pay very little.

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
People who earn a lot pay more.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,120
So this is something that everyone has to pay and that's why it's called federal tax,

168
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
right?

169
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
That's right.

170
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,800
So federal means national and state means more local for your own state.

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Okay.

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,240
Now, she is obviously paying the federal tax that everyone has to pay.

173
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
And what about Medicare?

174
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
All right.

175
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
So this is not a tax per se.

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,800
This is actually a deduction that goes into kind of a fund.

177
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760
You know, it's a government program.

178
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,480
And when you're older, when you're retired, you will receive benefits from the federal

179
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,640
government, from the United States government to get healthcare.

180
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,320
So Medicare is a kind of healthcare that is paid for by the US government.

181
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
I see.

182
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,120
So when you're older, you don't really have to pay for your hospital bills then because

183
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,640
you worked and contributed to this Medicare fund, then you can go and get treatment.

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
That's right.

185
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,880
Or you pay for part of it and they pay for part of it.

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,800
So it depends on the system.

187
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,640
But yes, it's a way to get healthcare through the government.

188
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Okay.

189
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,720
And your next word is interesting because we've heard about Social Security before.

190
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,600
You have the Social Security card, which is basically your ID.

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
It states also that you are an American.

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,800
But what is the Social Security fund now that you are contributing to?

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,160
Well, basically, this is another government program that is designed to make sure that

194
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,200
people are comfortable when they stop working.

195
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,920
Because when you stop working, you don't have any income anymore.

196
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,600
You need money to live.

197
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,900
And so your whole life, you're paying into this fund and the government will then give

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:25,040
you the money back, some money, to basically live off of when you're retired.

199
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Okay.

200
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,920
And so how long do you actually have to work in order to be eligible for Social Security?

201
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,320
I believe you have to be 65 to be eligible for Social Security, but I'm not sure.

202
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
It's either 60 or 65.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm not there yet.

204
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
All right.

205
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,720
And actually, another one that's very similar is you have this 401K, which is actually a

206
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,560
very interesting name for this tax or fund.

207
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,960
Yeah, 401K is more of an investment.

208
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,280
So a 401K is something that you put money into every month or year to access later on

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
when you're retired.

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,960
So again, it's a kind of security for you.

211
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,880
If you work every day, every year for 30 years, 40 years, you want to have some money when

212
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,320
you're all done.

213
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
And this is basically a retirement savings plan.

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,520
So what is the difference between Social Security and the 401K, or are they the same?

215
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,920
I think the difference is where the money goes.

216
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm not 100%.

217
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,280
But all of these are like, you have to give the government this money, or can I say, hey,

218
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't want to, don't worry about me.

219
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,200
I don't need Social Security.

220
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm saving all on my own.

221
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,040
And can I refuse to pay these taxes?

222
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,440
401K, yes, you can refuse.

223
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
It's not a tax.

224
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,800
It's just something that you can...

225
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
Usually this is not a government program.

226
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,440
This is something that the company that you work for will set up for you.

227
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,680
But Medicare and Social Security, these are things that you have to pay into.

228
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,400
Because even if you're rich and you have all this money, there are a lot of people in America

229
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
that don't have any of this.

230
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,880
And so we consider it something that we do for each other as much as for ourselves.

231
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,520
Because also, Medicare and Medicaid, these are programs that you can also be eligible

232
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,720
for even if you're 25 years old or 30 years old.

233
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
You're poor, you don't have a job.

234
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,120
So these are social programs.

235
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,560
Okay, very good.

236
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
It's very, very interesting.

237
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,280
You see that, obviously, this is why in movies, you see that people make fun of taxes and

238
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,600
how much tax in America there is and how you can't escape taxes.

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,840
But it's interesting to see how it's made up and why you are giving your money to the

240
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
government.

241
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
That's right.

242
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
So let's listen to today's dialogue again.

243
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,200
It was pretty complicated.

244
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,800
So hopefully you've understood a little bit more after we've talked about it now.

245
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
I have some questions about my paycheck.

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
You bet, Emily.

248
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Pull up a chair.

249
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,280
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States.

250
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,760
And there are a few things I don't understand.

251
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,200
First off, what is this FICA and SUI SDI tax?

252
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,760
And why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

253
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,400
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

254
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,080
This number here represents your gross pay.

255
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,920
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,400
Then here we have a series of deductions.

257
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,000
First off are the federal ones.

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,120
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act or something like that.

259
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
It's your federal income tax.

260
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,600
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you

261
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,800
out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

262
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,440
All right, I see.

263
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.

264
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
That's right.

265
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

266
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
There's the state income tax.

267
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,400
And then this SUI SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or

268
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,080
disability fund that our state has set up.

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,840
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

270
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,320
Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that.

271
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,160
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,320
That's right.

273
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,200
Not all states have an income tax.

274
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,000
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I see.

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All right.

277
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,240
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

279
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,560
Thanks for your help, Susan.

280
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
No problem.

281
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,360
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

282
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,440
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

283
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

284
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,640
I just never paid much attention.

285
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,520
See you later.

286
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
All right.

287
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:48,600
So another interesting thought that came up was, well, where does the money for government

288
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,160
spending come from?

289
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,040
So because you have all these taxes that are for you, basically you have property tax or

290
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,480
maybe does it come from sales tax that maybe the government can make roads and parks and

291
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
stuff like this?

292
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Well, that's the thing.

293
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,840
Remember earlier we talked about federal and state taxes.

294
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,040
Well, if it's a state tax like sales tax, in America I can pay sales tax in California,

295
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,240
but maybe in New Mexico there is no sales tax.

296
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,280
So this is a state tax.

297
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,480
And that means that the state government can use the money for state projects, parks, roads,

298
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,760
things like that.

299
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,040
But then the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, the FICA, this federal tax, that is something

300
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,120
that's used for our military, our government.

301
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,880
This pays the paychecks of people in Congress, the president.

302
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,840
This is where all the money to pay them comes from.

303
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,000
And so basically the state taxes pay for state benefits and programs and the federal taxes

304
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,320
pay for these nationwide programs.

305
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,800
So that's, I think one of the most interesting things about this topic is that the United

306
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,920
States is like 50 small countries that kind of have their own little governments.

307
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,640
They have their own taxes and they have their own rules.

308
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,000
Like in some states you can start driving when you're 16 and others when you're 15.

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,680
And so it's like all these little small countries, but at the same time you have this one mega

310
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,360
country that has federal taxes and federal insurance and military and all this.

311
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
That's true.

312
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,360
And you know, it's an interesting fact about American history that the most conflict in

313
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,760
our country has really come down to these two groups.

314
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,240
One group believes that the federal government, so that's the national government, should

315
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,280
have more power than the states.

316
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,500
And another group believes that the state should have more power.

317
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,120
And that is a big problem.

318
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,560
You know, this disagreement that we've had in America that goes back to 1776 and the

319
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
founding fathers.

320
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,480
And so I don't think it's something that is fixed.

321
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,080
You know, these things change, you know, sometimes more federal power, sometimes less, but it's

322
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,100
a very interesting part of American history.

323
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,640
And also it would be interesting to hear from our users how it works over there, because

324
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:57,400
I know that approximately a rough estimate is that around 30 to 40% of Americans' income

325
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,560
goes to tax, right?

326
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
About that, yeah.

327
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,520
So almost half of your money goes into taxes.

328
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,960
So I wonder how much it is in other people's countries.

329
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,520
Maybe they have 60% of taxes or maybe 10.

330
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Yeah.

331
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
So let us know.

332
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,720
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

333
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
We hope to see you guys there.

334
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
All right.

335
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Bye.
