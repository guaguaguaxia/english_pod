00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Kathryn.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
And today Marco and I get to share with you the thrilling conclusion to the, well, very

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,520
popular I must say, series.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm sorry, I love you.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
That's right.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,320
Today is the finale, the final episode, episode 10.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,480
This is where it all ends.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,000
So what do you think is going to happen?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
If I guess, you're just going to get angry at me because I actually know how it ends.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,760
But let's just say I hope that it ends well for our protagonists.

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,120
There was a lot of controversy around it because, you know, I wanted to know if people wanted

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,960
a happy ending, a sad ending, unexpected.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,600
I guess everyone wants a happy ending, right?

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Absolutely.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,820
So we're going to, well, keep our fingers crossed for Steven and Veronica and check

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,120
out this dialogue one time.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:07,240
Steven, good to see you, brother.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
How are you?

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
How was your trip?

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
It was fine.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,520
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,880
I've missed you all.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
How's mom?

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
She's great.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,800
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,880
You're her pride and joy.

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,160
You know that, right?

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,160
I can't wait to see her.

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
You?

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
What's new with you?

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,960
Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,640
You'll have another nephew or niece soon.

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
That's great.

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Wow.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Congrats.

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,880
You two are great together, you know?

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,040
You have such a beautiful family.

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I hope that one day I can have that.

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Of course, man.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Come on.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,920
I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini.

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,880
You know, she's still pining after you.

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,520
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,920
What are you talking about?

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
I hardly knew her.

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,760
How could she be in love with me?

50
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,240
I couldn't go through with it, even though she's a great woman.

51
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,560
No, I left my heart in the United States.

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,440
I just hope Veronica is happy.

53
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Get over it.

54
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,920
You're home now.

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,120
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,920
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,720
You can marry anyone you want.

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,080
I don't want to marry anyone.

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,040
I want to marry her.

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Don't you understand?

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,840
You are incorrigible.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Steven!

63
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
My baby!

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
How are you?

65
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I miss you so much!

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Hey, Mom.

67
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Great to see you.

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
You look so thin!

69
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Didn't those Americans feed you?

70
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Come, come.

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Let's have some Thai.

72
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

73
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Hi, Steven.

74
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:49,440
Veronica, how did you get here?

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,220
How do you know where I live?

76
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,120
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

77
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,600
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

78
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,680
I realized that I was just scared.

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,920
Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

80
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm here now.

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,680
Now there's something I want to ask you.

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:28,920
Steven, will you marry me?

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,040
I now declare you husband and wife.

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,040
You may kiss the bride.

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,360
All right, so they got married.

86
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
You got married.

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
We got married.

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I got married.

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
Wow, I should have called my mom.

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,040
Not only did you get married, but you got married Bollywood style with music and everything

91
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
nice.

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,800
Those weddings are like four days long.

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,600
I hope you enjoyed the finale of this story.

94
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Absolutely.

95
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,320
I was glad to see that it was a happy ending.

96
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,960
I have to say if it had been a sad ending, I would have been a little bit disappointed

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,760
because well, Veronica and I...

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
You get along.

99
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
We get along.

100
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
All right.

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,040
So apart from this happy ending and this happy finale that we had, we did look at a lot of

102
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,380
great words and phrases.

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,880
So why don't we start now with language takeaway?

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Language takeaway.

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
So the first couple of phrases I want to talk about here have to do with maybe catching

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,040
up and talking about family or gossip because we're talking to Stephen's Indian family who

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
hasn't seen for a long, long time.

108
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,000
The first thing he's talking to his brother about his brother and his wife.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,560
So Gulam and Nisha are expecting, we find out.

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,280
Right, they're expecting.

111
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,920
So if Gulam and Nisha are expecting, what does that mean exactly?

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,640
They're expecting a letter.

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,880
Expecting a baby maybe?

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Aha, yeah.

115
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
So here we go.

116
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,280
So I'm expecting is a very common English way of saying I'm going to have a baby.

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm pregnant.

118
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
All right.

119
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,720
So don't get this confused.

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,480
If somebody says, oh, well, I'm expecting, you don't have to say expecting what?

121
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Exactly.

122
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,080
When it's only expecting, when it's not a thing afterwards, I'm expecting means I'm

123
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,520
pregnant or she's expecting.

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,480
She's going to have a baby.

125
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,680
So they are expecting a baby or they're expecting.

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,560
And they were talking about, well, Stephen, he was supposed to get married in India and

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,440
his brother said a very interesting, where he said, well, these girls are still, this

128
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,880
girl is still pining over you.

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,320
So the Shalini, some girl that Stephen used to know when he was living in India, she's

130
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,840
pining after you.

131
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,260
Well, pine has many different meanings in English.

132
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,340
But in this sense, we're talking about having a crush on or being in love with.

133
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,680
And also it's a way of saying that you are, that you desire, you yearn for this person

134
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
very, very much.

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
But that you don't have them.

136
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Right.

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
You don't have them.

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
You want them.

139
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
So you're pining over this person.

140
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
Now, can you pine over an object?

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
No.

142
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
No.

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Usually it's maybe related to love or to a person, right?

144
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Yeah.

145
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,760
So she, she stands by the door every day waiting the letter that doesn't come.

146
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,400
She's pining away for her dear love, Thomas or whatever.

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,840
And you know what I read recently is that people can get addicted to pining.

148
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Really?

149
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Yeah.

150
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,240
So maybe you can pine after a person not because you miss them or you want to, but you kind

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,960
of grow accustomed to it and you become addicted to this pain that's kind of pleasurable.

152
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
There is a way to describe this.

153
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
It's called Petrarchan love.

154
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,800
Well, it's this kind of traditional idea in poetry where you have a love that's never

155
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,240
consummated, that's never filled.

156
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,480
You never get to be with the person that you love, that you desire.

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,760
And so it's a way, yeah, it's a way of distinguishing the two different kinds of love.

158
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,680
Some where you're with the person and the other where you always want them, but you

159
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,160
can never have them.

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Well, hopefully none of our listeners are pining over anyone or, or get to experience

161
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
that, huh?

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Exactly.

163
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,840
But if you do pine away or you pine after someone, you have to hope that one day you'll

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,600
get over that person.

165
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,360
Yeah, you have to get over it.

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,040
And that's what his brother says, hey, get over it.

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,880
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

168
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,800
So what does it mean when you're supposed to get over someone?

169
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,920
Okay, this is a good question because, you know, we're talking here not about actually

170
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,760
getting up on top of a fence or a wall.

171
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,320
We're talking about emotions.

172
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,080
So getting over someone, so I have to get over him means that I have to stop feeling

173
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,840
so sad about what, what happened, right?

174
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,100
Because usually you say this when someone's sad or angry.

175
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,360
And also it kind of means that you have to forget or let that person go, you know, like

176
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
get over it.

177
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,680
We're going to move on here to the last word in today's language takeaway, which is incorrigible.

178
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,760
Okay, an incorrigible person.

179
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,920
Alright, incorrigible.

180
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
What could this mean?

181
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Well, let's look at the sentence where we find it.

182
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,240
You are incorrigible.

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,760
Gulam says this to Stephen.

184
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Right.

185
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,920
So it's an adjective and basically it means that you have no correction of some sort.

186
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,560
Well, there's an argument between Stephen and Gulam.

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,640
So they're brothers.

188
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
And Stephen says, I don't want to get married.

189
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,920
I don't want to marry her.

190
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,560
He's complaining and his brother says, you are incorrigible.

191
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
You just won't stop.

192
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,040
So someone's feelings, their emotions, their ideas about something, they just can't be

193
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,880
changed or altered.

194
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
They're fixed.

195
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,240
You know, this guy, he's like, I'm not going to get married.

196
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,760
And his brother says, you're incorrigible.

197
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
I just can't change your mind.

198
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,280
It's kind of like being stubborn.

199
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,960
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

200
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,300
And we hear this phrase a lot together.

201
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,680
So you're incorrigible.

202
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,680
So this is often just kind of a, it's not an insult, but it's a way for us to kind of

203
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,440
be sarcastic or to make fun of someone.

204
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
You're incorrigible, Marco.

205
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Usually you say it when you're loud, you know, you're being nice.

206
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,280
Okay, cool.

207
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,640
So five great words in language takeaway today.

208
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,120
And well, before we move on and listen to the dialogue again, why don't we take a look

209
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,880
at Fluency Builder?

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Fluency Builder.

211
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
All right.

212
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,080
So this phrase is something that parents often use and grandparents as well, because obviously

213
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,760
parents and grandparents, they're very proud of their children, their grandchildren.

214
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,200
So they describe something as being their pride and joy.

215
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
My pride and joy.

216
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,520
So it's usually a person that's your pride and joy.

217
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
It could be a thing too.

218
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,640
It could be a thing.

219
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,920
His Porsche Boxster is his pride and joy.

220
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,240
He goes out every morning and he washes it.

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
He changes the oil, he checks the gas, checks the tires.

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
So it's his pride and joy.

223
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
All right.

224
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,560
It's his most valued possession.

225
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,880
So it always goes together, right?

226
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,260
My pride and joy.

227
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Pride and joy.

228
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Yeah.

229
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Just think of it as a phrase, pride and joy.

230
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
All right.

231
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,920
So I'm my mother's pride and joy.

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I think you are.

233
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
All right.

234
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
So you don't know my mom.

235
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
All right.

236
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
So somebody's pride and joy.

237
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
So now another phrase that we took a look at, and it's a way of making conversation,

238
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,280
especially with a person that you haven't seen in a while.

239
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,000
He said, Hey, what's new with you?

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,880
What's new with you?

241
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
What's new with you?

242
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
All right.

243
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,520
So this might sound a little strange because normally we say, how have you been?

244
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
It's been a long time.

245
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
How are you?

246
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,880
But this is like, you know, it's a fluency builder phrase.

247
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
So it's very colloquial, it's very spoken language.

248
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
This you hear often between friends or family members.

249
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,960
Hey, Marco, what's new with you?

250
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,320
So how do you, I would answer this by saying, oh, well, not much.

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,740
Or I just bought a new house.

252
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,480
So basically you're asking for news from a person.

253
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,720
I haven't seen you in a long time.

254
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,400
You look, you look happy and healthy.

255
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
So what's new with you?

256
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Oh, I got married.

257
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,040
I got a new car.

258
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,400
These things that you can say, these are changes in my life.

259
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
All right.

260
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,480
And usually after somebody asks you, what's new with you?

261
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,120
You say something and then you usually would follow up and ask that person as well, right?

262
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,600
What's new and what's new with you?

263
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Exactly.

264
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
So, you know, I got a new house, got a new job.

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's new with you?

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Or what about you?

268
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What about you?

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,600
So it's a nice, very relaxed, informal way of asking someone for news in their life.

270
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Perfect.

271
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
All right.

272
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
What's new with you?

273
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
What else?

274
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Now, he was supposed to get married, right?

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Right.

276
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
So this is news.

277
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
He was supposed to get married.

278
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
He didn't get married.

279
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
What's going on?

280
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,400
His brother, his mother, they all want to know what's going on.

281
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,360
And we find out that wedding, that girl, he just couldn't go through with it.

282
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,680
So I can't, I couldn't go through with it.

283
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Okay.

284
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
This past tense.

285
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,160
So he's saying, before I came to India with this girl, I couldn't go through with it.

286
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,160
So present would be, I can't go through with it.

287
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,240
And going through with what here?

288
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,960
We've got it, this kind of magical, strange word, it.

289
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
What could this be?

290
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,920
So basically, what he's saying is that he couldn't complete or maybe finish something

291
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
that he started.

292
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Right.

293
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,440
So in this case, we're talking about a relationship.

294
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Or marriage.

295
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Yeah, a relationship.

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
So maybe we loved each other, but I couldn't go through with it.

297
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,760
I couldn't go to the finish line.

298
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Right.

299
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I couldn't get married.

300
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,800
You see that a lot when maybe in movies, two people are supposed to get married.

301
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,560
They're at the altar, and all of a sudden the bride says, I can't, or she goes away

302
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
crying.

303
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
I can't go through with this.

304
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Exactly.

305
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,000
So because she loves somebody else, so can't go through with it.

306
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Great.

307
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
So really good phrase.

308
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
I can't go through with it.

309
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,580
He couldn't go through with it.

310
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,080
And we find out that, well, not such a bad thing.

311
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,940
Steven, he's very popular in India.

312
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
The girls love him.

313
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,000
We've got a great phrase for describing having lots of girls who love you.

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Right.

315
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,960
He says there will be girls throwing themselves at you.

316
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Literally?

317
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Like, ow, that might hurt.

318
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
I can't imagine that.

319
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,640
Like, just somebody throwing themselves at you?

320
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,080
No, it's not literal.

321
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,360
It's basically saying girls are very interested in you.

322
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Girls are so interested in you that they'll be chasing you almost.

323
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
All right.

324
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,480
So many, many girls, they will follow you.

325
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
They'll want to be in a relationship with you.

326
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
They like you.

327
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,840
So he's saying, listen, there are other girls.

328
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Don't worry.

329
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,600
Girls here, they love you.

330
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
And it doesn't only work with girls, right?

331
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,880
I can say there'll be boys throwing themselves at you.

332
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Right.

333
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,280
So this is something we say about both genders, boys and girls.

334
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,600
You could say, oh, God, all the boys were throwing themselves at her.

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm so jealous.

336
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Right.

337
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,320
But it's only basically in a loving way, right?

338
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,680
It can't be anything else.

339
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,000
Like somebody's chasing you for other reasons.

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,360
No, this is saying that they have crushes, they have feelings, they want to be romantic.

341
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,960
It's not a bad thing, but sometimes it's too much attention, so it can be kind of negative.

342
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Yeah.

343
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
All right.

344
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Well, interesting phrases on Fluency Builder today.

345
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,200
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time.

346
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Get up and dance.

347
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Yeah.

348
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Get up and dance.

349
00:13:49,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Stephen, good to see you, brother.

350
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
How are you?

351
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
How was your trip?

352
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
It was fine.

353
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,160
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

354
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I've missed you all.

355
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
How's mom?

356
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
She's great.

357
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,440
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to United States.

358
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,520
You're her pride and joy.

359
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
You know that, right?

360
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,560
I can't wait to see you.

361
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
You?

362
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
What's new with you?

363
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,600
Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

364
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,320
You'll have another nephew or niece soon.

365
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
That's great.

366
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Wow.

367
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Congrats.

368
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,640
You two are great together, you know?

369
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,720
You have such a beautiful family.

370
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,680
I hope that one day I can have that.

371
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Of course, man.

372
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Come on.

373
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,600
I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini.

374
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,520
You know, she's still finding after you.

375
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,040
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

376
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,600
What are you talking about?

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
I hardly knew her.

378
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,440
How could she be in love with me?

379
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,000
I couldn't go through with it even though she's a great woman.

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,240
No, I left my heart in the United States.

381
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
I just hope Veronica is happy.

382
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Get over it.

383
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
You're home now.

384
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,800
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

385
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
They'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

386
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,080
You can marry anyone you want.

387
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,680
I don't want to marry anyone.

388
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
I want to marry her.

389
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,500
Don't you understand?

390
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
You are incorrigible.

391
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:29,920
Steven, my baby, how are you?

392
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,480
I miss you so much.

393
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Hey, mom.

394
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Great to see you.

395
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
You look so thin.

396
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
Didn't those Americans feed you?

397
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Come, come.

398
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Let's have some Thai.

399
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,800
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

400
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Hi, Steven.

401
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Veronica, how did you get here?

402
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
How do you know where I live?

403
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

404
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

405
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I realized that I was just scared, scared of how much I love you and of the commitment

406
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
that marriage requires.

407
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
I'm here now.

408
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Now, there's something I want to ask you.

409
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Steven, will you marry me?

410
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm sorry, I don't think I can.

411
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I don't know how to say it.

412
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm sorry.

413
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I'm sorry.

414
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm sorry.

415
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I'm sorry.

416
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm sorry.

417
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm sorry.

418
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm sorry.

419
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I'm sorry.

420
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm sorry.

421
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm sorry.

422
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm sorry.

423
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm sorry.

424
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm sorry.

425
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I'm sorry.

426
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Alright, so it's over.

427
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Sad, sad but sweet.

428
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Sad but sweet, huh?

429
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Well, we went from them meeting casually by a bike accident.

430
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah, we had nice music.

431
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Then it turned out that she was angry, they kind of broke up, they got back together.

432
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,800
He was being strained with all of these secret trips to save people.

433
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
It was interesting.

434
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
We went a lot of different ways.

435
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
She was pregnant, she wasn't really pregnant.

436
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
The doctor was stalking her.

437
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
She had a stalker.

438
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
He's in the secret service.

439
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
It was an interesting ride.

440
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Very interesting.

441
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Well, now we need to think of a new drama, a new soap opera or novel.

442
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
So, we need your input.

443
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Maybe we should open it up.

444
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
What did you like?

445
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
What didn't you like?

446
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
And what kind of genre are you interested in?

447
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Because you know, there's tons of different kinds of stories we could tell.

448
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Right, maybe we can do something scary like a thriller or horror.

449
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm a big fan of sci-fi.

450
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Or sci-fi, maybe we can do something sci-fi.

451
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Maybe we can do a comedy, something maybe like Friends, I don't know.

452
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
That'd be kind of cute.

453
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Yeah, it could be.

454
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
All right, so listeners, why don't you give us your input?

455
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
We need your feedback.

456
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Tell us what series you would like next, what type of series.

457
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Maybe, like we said, drama, sci-fi, action, what would you like?

458
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,800
And please get in touch with us, leave comments and questions at our website, englishpod.com.
