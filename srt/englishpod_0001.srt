00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,600
And Amira and I are here today with a great, great lesson for you.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,840
Yes, we are.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,560
Today we're going to be talking about a restaurant.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,040
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more details?

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,560
Well, we're talking about a situation in a restaurant and two people are involved, the

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,640
waiter and the customer.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,000
And I don't want to say any more.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,680
Okay, don't say any more.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:44,720
Let's just listen to this dialogue and we'll be back later to explain it.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
Good evening.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
My name is Fabio.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,120
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,440
May I take your order?

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,940
No, I'm still working on it.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,080
This menu is not even in English.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
What's good here?

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,720
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,680
Does it come with coke and fries?

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,200
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,600
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,560
Excellent choice.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,320
Your order will be ready soon.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
How soon is soon?

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
Twenty minutes.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
You know what?

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,400
I'll go grab a burger across the street.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,160
What a waiter!

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,560
What a waiter!

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,720
He is really angry at this customer and I can't blame him.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,760
I would be angry too.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Yeah.

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,480
So, I think, Marco, you have chosen some interesting expressions for us here.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
What is the first one?

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Well, the first one is I'm still working on it.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm still working on it.

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm still working on it.

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm still working on it.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,040
Why don't we listen to some other examples on how you can use this word and then we'll

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,360
come back and explain it.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,720
Did you finish reading the magazine?

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm still working on it.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Did you fix my car?

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm still working on it.

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Ah, so you could say I'm still working on it means I still need more time.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Fantastic.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Great.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OK, it's clear.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,720
I have another one for you guys.

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,520
It's a phrase commonly used and you'll hear it all the time.

53
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
Coke and fries.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
Coke and fries.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Coke and fries.

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,840
Coke and fries.

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,600
It's a short way of saying Coca-Cola and French fries.

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,760
So that's basically America's fast food.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,360
Yeah, burger, coke and fries.

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,520
OK.

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,920
What's next on the menu?

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,520
On the menu we have a complimentary glass of wine.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,880
Complimentary glass of wine.

64
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,640
Complimentary glass of wine.

65
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
Complementary means?

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
That it's free.

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Free.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Yes.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
We love that, huh?

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
Yeah, we definitely like free things.

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, I have another one for us here, another interesting phrase.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll go with.

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll go with.

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
I'll go with.

75
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
I'll go with.

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,560
So basically it's another way of saying I'm choosing.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Yeah, I'll choose or I'll take.

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
I'll take.

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,560
OK, very good.

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright, the next word that I want to take a look at is grab.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Grab.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Grab.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Grab.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,120
OK, now let's listen to some other examples of how we could use grab in different situations

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:06,680
and then we'll come back and explain it.

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,800
On your way home, can you grab some milk?

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Wait for me, please.

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,400
I need to grab my coat.

89
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,960
All right, well, I would understand that go grab means go get quickly.

91
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,320
To go get quickly, yeah.

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Yeah.

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
All right, everyone.

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,240
So now it's time to listen one more time to the dialogue and listen carefully and try

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
to understand why the waiter doesn't like the customer.

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's listen.

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Good evening.

98
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
My name is Fabio.

99
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,240
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,560
May I take your order?

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,080
No, I'm still working on it.

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,200
This menu is not even in English.

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
What's good here?

104
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,920
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Does it come with Coke and fries?

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:17,280
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,720
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,640
Excellent choice.

109
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Your order will be ready soon.

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,640
How soon is soon?

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,560
Twenty minutes.

112
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
You know what?

113
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,520
I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

114
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:45,680
Marco, why did this waiter get angry at the customer?

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,080
Well, he basically wasted the waiter's time.

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,200
I mean, this guy comes into the restaurant.

117
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,720
He is not very polite and he's asking all these questions.

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,200
In the end, he just gets up and says, I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,120
Yeah, and I also think that this guy was a lot more casual than the place he was in,

120
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
right?

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,200
I think this was a nice, fancy restaurant.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,720
So I think he was in the wrong place.

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Yeah.

125
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,880
So how many times, Marco, tell me, do you really have fast food a week?

126
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,360
Fast food, let's see, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

127
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
No, I'm just kidding.

128
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Oh my God.

129
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
No, no.

130
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,320
I think I get fast food maybe once a week, once or twice a week.

131
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,640
All right, talking about fast food made me hungry.

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
So I think I'm going to go grab something to eat myself.

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,720
Yeah, me too.

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
All right.

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,280
I hope you guys enjoyed the lesson today and remember that all of this vocabulary is useful

136
