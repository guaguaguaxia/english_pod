00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,380
My name is Catherine and today we're talking a little bit about going to sleep or not being

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,380
able to sleep.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,380
That's right.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,960
We are having some sleeping problems and we're actually going to check out a couple of words

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,440
related to this topic right now on Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,680
Okay, so the first word is actually the technical word that describes being unable to sleep.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,920
It's called insomnia.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Right.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,120
So if you have insomnia, it means that you can't fall asleep.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
You can't sleep.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Okay.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,700
So this is a pretty serious condition.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,960
For example, if you have insomnia and you don't sleep for three or four nights, you're

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,000
not going to do very well at work, right?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Or if you're studying, you're tired at school, you can't concentrate.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,040
So it's a very big problem.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
What's that other word though?

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,400
We have insomnia, but we also have another interesting disorder.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Right.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,880
If somebody is able to sleep but walks while they're sleeping, that person is called a

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
sleepwalker.

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
That's right.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,840
And you don't actually just have to walk to be a sleepwalker.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,280
You can do any number of strange things like basically acting like you're awake when you're

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
not.

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Exactly.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,760
So some people get up and walk, actually go outside.

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,880
Some people get dressed.

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,480
Some people go downstairs and cook.

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,200
And the worst is the people who eat because they gain weight and they don't know why.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Exactly.

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,520
So sleepwalking is what you do.

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
And if you do this, you're called a sleepwalker.

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Okay.

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,720
Sleepwalk is the verb.

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,440
Sleepwalker is the noun or the person.

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
All right.

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,160
So we've taken a look at two words that we're going to find in our dialogue today.

44
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Why don't we go now and listen to the dialogue for the first time.

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,320
Alex, what's up with you?

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
You look dreadful.

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Hey, Jill.

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
I don't know.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,040
I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks.

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,520
I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep.

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,560
I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed.

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
I've tried eating and not eating different foods.

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
I've even tried counting sheep.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,440
And then when I finally get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares.

55
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,520
So I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Wow.

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,480
Maybe you should get that checked out.

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Maybe you're stressed.

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,640
Just take some sedatives.

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,160
Works for me.

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,540
Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

62
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,040
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,440
I heard of that.

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,800
But does that apply to Alex's situation?

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,320
Yeah, sure.

67
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Why not?

68
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,360
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing so taking melatonin

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
should do the trick.

70
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,680
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,880
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

72
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,520
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,000
It's easy and curable.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,360
Well, there's that too.

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Alright we're back.

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,000
So obviously this person not only has insomnia but also has nightmares, sleepwalks, a mess.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
And you can tell when someone hasn't been sleeping well.

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,280
They have that look like there's bags under their eyes or they just look really tired.

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,720
And so the friend here says, Alex, you look dreadful.

82
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
That's right, dreadful.

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,600
So this is an adjective and it's a way to describe someone that looks terrible.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,960
You look horrible.

85
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
You look tired.

86
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You look sleepy.

87
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
That's right.

88
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,320
So this is not a compliment.

89
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,260
This is something that you say when you're worried about someone.

90
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,840
So for example, if someone's really, really tired, you say, you look dreadful.

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,040
Or if someone is wearing very dirty clothes, they don't look like they went home yesterday,

92
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,400
you say, what's wrong?

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You look dreadful.

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Right.

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,400
I think you can also use it to describe objects or maybe food, right?

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,880
This lasagna is dreadful.

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,280
It means it's very bad.

98
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,880
And you don't want to say that to the person who cooked it, of course.

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Exactly.

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,520
Alright, so the person obviously because is suffering from insomnia looks dreadful.

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,400
And he was explaining what he does to try to fall asleep.

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,400
For example, counting sheep, stretching, and he also said that he tried different breathing

103
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
techniques.

104
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,320
Okay, so basically a technique is an approach to something, a kind of method.

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,960
But in this case, we're talking about breathing techniques.

106
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,780
So for some people, one breathing technique is breathing in through your nose and breathing

107
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,120
out through your mouth.

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Like that.

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,280
That's one kind of technique.

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,600
So a technique, as you say, is a way of doing something.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
So breathing techniques are different ways of breathing.

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,560
So maybe you will relax, so maybe you'll fall asleep, things like this.

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Exactly.

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,840
It's one of those things that you might learn about in a yoga class, for example.

115
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,640
There's different breathing techniques.

116
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Right.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,040
And you can combine techniques with other words as well, adding the ing.

118
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,520
For example, you have walking techniques, maybe to put less stress on your knees.

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,720
Or running techniques, swimming techniques.

120
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,680
I think there's a technique for almost everything.

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,520
Just about anything you can do, there's a technique for it.

122
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Right.

123
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

124
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
All right.

125
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,720
And well, moving on, he was talking about his nightmares and he described his nightmares

126
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,280
as disturbing.

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,720
He has disturbing nightmares.

128
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,520
Okay, well, I think this is an important word to cover here, Marco, because we've heard

129
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,560
the verb to disturb before.

130
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,960
Like I'm sorry to disturb you.

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,840
It means I'm sorry to bother you.

132
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,680
But disturbing is an adjective.

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
It describes something that makes me very uncomfortable.

134
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Right?

135
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Right.

136
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,880
So, for example, a lot of times in the news, we see very disturbing images, car accidents

137
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,640
or fires or bombs.

138
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,880
And what's disturbing is when you see human beings who have been hurt.

139
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,160
So images that make you really uncomfortable or sad, these are disturbing.

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Exactly.

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,240
So disturbing nightmares are nightmares that are not very pleasant.

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,320
They make him scared, maybe, or uncomfortable.

143
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Right.

144
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,240
Like a dream, for example, where your parents die.

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,000
It's pretty disturbing.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Exactly.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
All right.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,160
And well, one of his friends recommended, you know what?

149
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,360
Stop with all of this.

150
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,080
Just take some sedatives.

151
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Okay.

152
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,320
So sedatives are a kind of medicine that help a person relax or that help make a person

153
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
tired.

154
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Right.

155
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,920
So I think it comes from the verb to sedate.

156
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Yes.

157
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,880
And basically that is to calm down, to tranquilize.

158
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
That's right.

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,640
So in this case, we're talking about a person, but you can also give an animal sedatives.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,560
For example, if you want to take your dog on an airplane, the dog needs to relax.

161
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
You give it some sedatives.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Exactly.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,960
And I think when he mentioned a specific name of a sedative, it's melatonin.

164
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
That's right.

165
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,320
So melatonin, melatonin is a chemical that our bodies naturally produce that help calm

166
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
us down.

167
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,240
And so a lot of pharmaceutical companies or drug companies sell melatonin in a pill form.

168
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,240
It's basically, it's a chemical that helps you relax.

169
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Exactly.

170
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
So obviously if you take melatonin, you're going to feel sleepy or you're going to be

171
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,920
very relaxed and you're going to fall asleep a lot easier.

172
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
Well, hopefully.

173
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Hopefully.

174
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
That's right.

175
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,600
So, and well, the whole thing that we've been talking about, insomnia, sleepwalking, these

176
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,840
are called sleeping disorders.

177
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Right.

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,160
And remember, you might also hear the term sleep disorders.

179
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,480
They mean problems with sleeping.

180
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,000
So people who either cannot fall asleep or people who have bad dreams or people who sleep

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
walk.

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Exactly.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,860
So a disorder is something of an illness or a condition that is not normal.

184
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,080
So for example, as you said, a sleeping disorder or a sleep disorder, it means that you're

185
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
not able to sleep properly or normally.

186
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,920
But there are other kinds of disorders, right?

187
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Right.

188
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,840
And many people have heard of eating disorders.

189
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Okay.

190
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
So that's basically people who do not eat like everyone else.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Exactly.

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,560
So that's what happens with a disorder.

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
All right.

194
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,360
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab.

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,920
Now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

196
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,520
But before that, why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

197
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,300
Alex, what's up with you?

198
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
You look dreadful.

199
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Hey, Jill.

200
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
I don't know.

201
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,040
I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks.

202
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,480
I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep.

203
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,520
I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed.

204
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,640
I've tried eating and not eating different foods.

205
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,040
I've even tried counting sheep.

206
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,400
And then when I finally get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares.

207
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,520
So I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

208
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Wow.

209
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,460
Maybe you should get that checked out.

210
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,160
Maybe you're stressed.

211
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Just take some sedatives.

212
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,140
Works for me.

213
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,540
Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

214
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,040
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

215
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,280
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

216
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,440
I heard of that.

217
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,920
But does that apply to Alex's situation?

218
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,280
Yeah, sure.

219
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Why not?

220
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,440
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing.

221
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,620
So taking melatonin should do the trick.

222
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,680
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

223
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,880
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

224
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,520
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

225
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,000
It's easy and curable.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,680
Well, there's that too.

228
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,400
All right, we're back.

229
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,600
So now we have three main phrases for Fluency Builder.

230
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,320
Why don't we start with the first one?

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Okay.

232
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,880
So you heard in today's dialogue an interesting phrase.

233
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't know if it exists in other languages, but in English we say when you're trying to

234
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,160
fall asleep, there's a good technique to help you do so.

235
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
You count sheep.

236
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,480
Yeah, I think you see it in cartoons all the time.

237
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,360
A person is sleeping and over that cartoon's head is a little cloud and you see sheep jumping

238
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
over a fence, right?

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,720
So yeah, basically there's a fence and you say one, two, three, and the process of counting

240
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
helps relax a person.

241
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
And you fall asleep.

242
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Right.

243
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,800
So counting sheep, I guess you're not literally out in a field counting sheep.

244
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,320
You're just imagining sheep in your head and you're trying to fall asleep.

245
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
That's right.

246
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Counting sheep.

247
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
All right.

248
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,600
And well, one of his friends recommended that maybe he should go to a doctor.

249
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,960
And Jill said that by saying, maybe you should get that checked out.

250
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Okay.

251
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:04,360
So to get something checked out, to get it checked out, this means to have a professional

252
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,640
give you a suggestion or to have a professional look at something.

253
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Exactly.

254
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,320
So maybe you should get examined.

255
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,220
Maybe you should go to the doctor.

256
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,560
This isn't just about disorders, right?

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,840
I mean, what if I have a sore tooth?

258
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I could say this.

259
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Right.

260
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,000
So if you have a toothache, I would recommend, maybe you should get that checked out by my

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
dentist.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Right.

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,800
Or maybe if you have a bad rash, you know, your skin is very red.

264
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,120
I say, Marco, I think you should get that checked out by a doctor.

265
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Exactly.

266
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,040
So to get something checked, to get something examined by a doctor or a professional.

267
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,120
All right.

268
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,400
And the last phrase that we have for you.

269
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,320
So last phrase we have today comes from a suggestion at the end.

270
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,840
The friend suggests taking melatonin.

271
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,920
And he says, listen, taking melatonin should do the trick.

272
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Right.

273
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,080
So if you end the phrase by saying, that should do the trick.

274
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,240
Basically you're saying that should solve your problem, that should help you.

275
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Exactly.

276
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,400
So the trick, you don't have to think about what the trick is.

277
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,320
It's just a way of saying it should fix your problem.

278
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,160
So for example, when someone is fixing my car and they have one more thing to do and

279
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,600
it's finished, he says, the car mechanic might say, that should do the trick.

280
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Right.

281
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,760
That means problem solved.

282
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,240
Or maybe you're having, you want to hang a picture on your wall.

283
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,720
So somebody puts a nail in the wall and that should do the trick and maybe that'll hold

284
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
up the painting.

285
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Done.

286
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Done.

287
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Okay.

288
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,920
So that's a way of saying, that should solve the problem.

289
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,680
This should be the solution.

290
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
That should be all.

291
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Okay.

292
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Okay.

293
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,920
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.

294
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:56,620
Alex, what's up with you?

295
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
You look dreadful.

296
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
Hey Jill.

297
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,840
I don't know.

298
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,740
I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks.

299
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,840
I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep.

300
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,880
I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed.

301
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,000
I've tried eating and not eating different foods.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
I've even tried counting sheep.

303
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,760
And then when I finally get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares.

304
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,840
So I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

305
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Wow.

306
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,800
I think you should get that checked out.

307
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,480
Maybe you're stressed.

308
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,920
Just take some sedatives.

309
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,440
Works for me.

310
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,840
Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

311
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,340
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

312
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,580
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

313
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,740
I heard of that.

314
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,200
But does that apply to Alex's situation?

315
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Yeah, sure.

316
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Why not?

317
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,760
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing.

318
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,920
So taking melatonin should do the trick.

319
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,960
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

320
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,160
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

321
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,800
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,280
It's easy and curable.

323
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,360
It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.

324
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
Well, there's that too.

325
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Alright, we're back.

326
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,320
So talking about dreaming, nightmares, insomnia, all of this, what do you do if you can't fall

327
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
asleep?

328
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,640
I don't really have this problem personally because I could fall asleep anywhere, anytime.

329
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,920
I've heard some people take like warm milk before going to sleep.

330
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,080
Some people take milk, although I also heard that dairy products before bedtime can make

331
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
you have nightmares.

332
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Oh, really?

333
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,640
Like if you eat cheese before bed.

334
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
I've heard that as well.

335
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,920
I've heard that if you have seafood before bed, you'll have nightmares as well.

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,600
But actually, have you ever had a dream when you are doing something and you wake up in

337
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
the middle of that?

338
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Yes.

339
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,400
I remember once I was dreaming, I was drinking a soda and all of a sudden I woke up and I

340
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,160
had my hand like in the air, like doing the action of me actually drinking the soda.

341
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,600
Actually sometimes this happens to me when I'm falling asleep.

342
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,320
I imagine I'm on a bike or something and I start to feel myself moving my legs and I

343
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,120
wake up and I'm like, wait, wait, what am I doing?

344
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,800
So the brain is very strange, I think, especially in those times when you're kind of asleep

345
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
and you're kind of awake.

346
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
Also when you wake up suddenly, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but

347
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,160
you feel like you're falling or something, all of a sudden you just wake up with a shake.

348
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,640
Yeah, your body moves.

349
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah, it's really scary.

350
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Your heart starts to beat.

351
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I don't know why that happens.
