00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,280
Welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,460
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,460
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,520
So, Marco, today we've got a little bit of an unusual lesson because we're talking about

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,120
hypothetical situations.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Right.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,480
We're talking about a unreal situation or something that may happen or may not happen.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Okay.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
So, you're going to hear all about this in today's dialogue.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,720
We're going to hear it a couple of times.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,480
When we come back, we'll be breaking it down for you.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
So, you know all about these great phrases and how to talk about not real situations

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,480
with your friends.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,400
Okay.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,760
Next question.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,480
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Duh.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,840
I would say yes.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Okay.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
My turn.

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,480
What would you do if you won the lottery?

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Let's see.

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,540
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for trips around the world.

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,240
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
All right.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
This is a good one.

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,640
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,240
All right.

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:30,000
So, I think that was clear and well, a very common situation to teenage girls talking

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,760
to each other about, you know, boys and what would you do and da-da-da.

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Guys do this too.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,840
So, don't just put this on the girls, okay?

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
I don't think we do it like this though.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,040
No, but it's actually a very popular game in the car to play.

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
The what if game.

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
The what if game.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Yeah.

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Exactly.

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,440
And that's exactly the topic that we want to talk about today is the structure what

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,240
if which is actually called a conditional.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
All right.

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,160
It's called a conditional because the results, the thing that happens depends on something

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
else.

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Exactly.

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,480
So, let's actually take a look at the words in today's language takeaway before we talk

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,040
about all this grammar stuff.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Language takeaway.

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Okay.

53
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,840
So, we'll start out with some basic words.

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,720
Well, you know, they were talking about guys and she said if Eric asked you out.

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Right?

56
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,080
So, to ask somebody out.

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
Okay, so this might be a little bit strange because you think, okay, to ask is to ask

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
a question.

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,680
But to ask out, it's a fixed phrase.

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,320
It's something you say, these two words go together, right?

61
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,800
So, I want to ask someone out, that means I want to invite someone on a date.

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
On a romantic date, usually.

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
So, yeah.

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,840
I want to ask him out to dinner or he asked me out to the movies.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,480
Now, if I didn't want to ask somebody out on a romantic date, what verb would you use?

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
I'd say you could invite someone out.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,480
But then again, it's always a little bit, well, you can say invite for someone if you're

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
going to ask them on a date too.

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,080
So, I'd say to ask out is always romantic and to invite can be romantic or just friends.

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay.

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,840
So, to ask somebody out.

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Now, they were talking about other situations, maybe they would go on a trip or something

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
and she said my dad would freak out.

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,520
This is a great phrase, this is something that I used a lot when I was a teenager.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,600
The word freak out?

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Freak out.

77
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,040
So, the verb to freak out means to be really angry or upset or, you know, it could be a

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
good thing or a bad thing.

79
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,080
But usually, when we're talking about our parents, it's a bad thing.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
It's a bad thing.

81
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
So, they get angry, they start yelling at you.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,040
So, freak out means like overreact.

84
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,840
All right.

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,720
The last word that we have in language takeaway today is committed.

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,880
Well let's look at the whole phrase.

87
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,040
He says she would have me committed.

88
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,320
So, this is actually being done to someone.

89
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,720
Now, we did look at this word before but basically for marriage, right?

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
To commit to somebody, to promise.

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,840
Yeah, but to have someone committed means that you're going to send them away to maybe

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
a mental institution.

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Exactly.

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,360
So, this means they have psychological problems and someone else sends them to the hospital

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,400
because they can't send themselves.

96
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Exactly.

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,760
So, it's always used to have someone committed, right?

98
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,960
Right, because it's being done to them.

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,480
They don't want it to happen.

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
It's involuntary.

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Okay.

102
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,520
So, she had him committed.

103
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,000
My mom's going to have me committed if I keep working 20 hours a day.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Exactly.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
So, that's the way you use it.

106
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,200
So, now you have another way of using this verb.

107
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,520
But now I think we should listen to this dialogue again.

108
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,280
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at this grammar

109
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,160
focus that we want to talk about.

110
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,480
Okay, next question.

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,320
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

112
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Duh, I would say yes.

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,400
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, my turn.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,200
What would you do if you won the lottery?

116
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,480
Let's see.

117
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,420
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

118
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,140
If you buy me a ticket, I will go with you for sure.

119
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,880
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.

120
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,480
Alright, this is a good one.

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,560
What would your mom say if you told her you were going to get married?

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,200
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.

123
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,520
Alright, so we understood all the vocab now.

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,320
Now let's take a look at these unreal situations and what we were saying, the what if game.

125
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Right, so I think it's important to push these into two different categories, right?

126
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,040
We have one kind where it's very unrealistic, it's probably not going to happen, that kind

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,400
of situation.

128
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,080
And the other one is a situation that could very well happen, something that's probably

129
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,740
very common, okay?

130
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,600
So the first one we're going to talk about is very unrealistic situations, things that

131
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
probably won't happen.

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,240
Okay, so let's take a look at an example that we found in the dialogue.

133
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,040
The most common one and I think everybody gets asked this question is, if you won the

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,280
lottery, what would you do?

135
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
Okay, if you won the lottery.

136
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,320
So this is a situation that's very uncommon, right?

137
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,600
Not many people win the lottery.

138
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,080
So we have to say, if you won the lottery, so we use this verb in the past tense.

139
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
If you won the lottery, if this happened, what would you do?

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Right.

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,680
So, Catherine, if you won the lottery, what would you do?

142
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,840
If I won the lottery, I would buy a boat and sail around the world with my friends.

143
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,800
Alright, so another example, again, using the same structure, right?

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,760
The verb in the simple past tense, we would say, if you were stuck on an island with one

145
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,280
other person, who would that be?

146
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,600
Alright, so if you were stuck on a desert island with one person, who would that person

147
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
be?

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,880
So Marco, I'm going to ask you, who would it be?

149
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,400
I think it would be an engineer or a scientist that could probably get me off the island.

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
What about your girlfriend?

151
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,680
No, no, well, you know, that's the point, if I can get to her quicker.

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
Okay.

153
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,720
I would say maybe kind of romantic, but kind of not.

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
So that's the first situation.

155
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,440
We've got these situations like being stuck on an island, winning the lottery.

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
These are very unlikely.

157
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
But what about the other kind?

158
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,960
But before we move on to that, you notice that we use the verb was, we didn't say, if

159
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
I was on an island, I said, if I were, right?

160
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Or if you were.

161
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,240
So this is the way that you use it in these conditionals.

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,960
If I were you, or if you were president of the United States.

163
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,360
Yeah, this is a rule.

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
So this is a grammar rule.

165
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,120
We're not going to describe why it happens because it's very, very complicated.

166
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,400
And you can look it up on our site.

167
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,720
But we're going to describe how to use it.

168
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
That's the most important.

169
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,600
So we can say, for example, Marco, if I were you, I would dye my hair red.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Why?

171
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I don't know.

172
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I think it would look cool.

173
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
I don't think so.

174
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,320
So if I were you, I would.

175
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,000
Or if you were me, what would you do?

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Exactly.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,680
So we always use it like this, right?

178
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,200
If you're going to use this conditional, always use were for the subject.

179
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Never was.

180
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Right.

181
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
So you can tell.

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
This is a very, very big grammar issue.

183
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,040
A lot of English speakers make this mistake.

184
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes, very many.

185
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,520
But now you know that you shouldn't make this mistake and you can speak properly.

186
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,560
All right, so now that we've seen these semi-unreal situations, let's move on to something that's

187
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,680
a little bit more probable, that it may happen.

188
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Right.

189
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,400
So we've got these situations that are common or likely.

190
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,520
For example, in this lesson we hear, I will go with you for sure.

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,100
So this is, if you buy me a ticket to travel, of course I will go with you.

192
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,600
So if you buy, this is in the present tense, if you buy, then I will.

193
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Right.

194
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Right.

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
So now you notice the difference.

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,840
The verb is in the present and then we use, instead of would, we use will.

197
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:25,360
So again, I can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will stay home and watch TV all day.

198
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay, so think about this.

199
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Before we talked about going to desert islands, now we're talking about rain and the weather.

200
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
They're very, very different.

201
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
The rain is, you know, it's very common.

202
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,420
So we can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will need an umbrella.

203
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
What about this?

204
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,640
If we have lunch tomorrow, what will we eat?

205
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,560
Okay, so we have lunch pretty much every day, right?

206
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah, pretty much.

207
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,760
So again, it's a situation that is very probable.

208
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,280
So if we have lunch tomorrow, we will probably eat, I don't know, pasta, I think.

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm feeling like pasta.

210
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Pasta, noodles.

211
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Yeah.

212
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,840
All right, so Marco, let's take another listen to some of these phrases and try and figure

213
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,400
out while you're listening, which kind of conditional it is, first or the second.

214
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Example one.

215
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,880
If it's sunny today, we will go to the park.

216
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Example two.

217
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,320
I would get a divorce if I were you.

218
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Example three.

219
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,000
Mary will be very sad if Joe leaves.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,160
Example four.

221
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,000
We wouldn't be so late if Nick drove faster.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Very good.

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,240
So we have two different examples and the first conditional is the one that we mentioned

224
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,260
is very probable and the second conditional is the one that's not so probable.

225
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,720
So they're very easy to distinguish.

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,760
You don't really need to know the names, just know how to use them, right?

227
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Exactly.

228
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,600
And so just remember, if you were me, what would you do?

229
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,040
We've got these kind of pairs, these words that go together.

230
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,720
And the other one is more common.

231
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,280
If it rains tomorrow, I will bring an umbrella.

232
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Perfect.

233
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,280
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time just to kind of reinforce everything

234
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:21,520
and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

235
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,020
Okay next question.

236
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,680
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

237
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
Duh, I would say yes.

238
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

239
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,140
Okay, my turn.

240
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,880
What would you do if you won the lottery?

241
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,760
Let's see.

242
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,840
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for trips around the world.

243
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,560
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.

244
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,960
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.

245
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,100
All right, this is a good one.

246
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,880
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:05,400
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.

248
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,120
So Marco, if we talk any more about grammar, someone's going to have to have me committed.

249
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,120
It is a little bit difficult to talk about grammar, especially on a podcast because it's

250
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,200
such a difficult topic and it's also kind of heavy, right?

251
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,240
It is, but I'll tell you this.

252
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,600
These are very, very common phrases.

253
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,080
People use these all the time.

254
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,920
We talk in hypotheticals very often.

255
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,520
So if you're asking for advice, for example, or if you're just playing a game in the car,

256
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,280
you're going to encounter these and it's very important to be able to know how to use them.

257
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,560
So, and this is what we want to see now.

258
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,640
