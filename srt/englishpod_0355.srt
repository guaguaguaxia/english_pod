00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,400
My name is Catherine and today we're tackling a very difficult issue for many English learners.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,480
We're talking about taking things from other people and giving them back.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
That's right.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,780
So today we are going to talk about money and we're going to lend money and borrow money

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:30,380
and we're going to talk more about this after we listen to the dialogue.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,380
Can I borrow five bucks?

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,380
No.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,380
Come on.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,260
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,780
Last time I lent you money you never paid me back.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,020
I promise if you lend me five dollars today I will repay you in full next week.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,020
Okay.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,860
But I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,860
Fine.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,500
I can't believe you don't trust me.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,900
It's nothing personal.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Just business.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,500
All right.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,060
So now let's take a look at that language on Language Takeaway.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,640
Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,300
So first up we have the key verbs for today.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,620
The verb to borrow and to lend.

25
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,140
Now this is a really important difference to make because many people make this mistake

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,100
where they use the wrong verb.

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,860
Now if I ask you Marco, can I borrow your bicycle?

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,380
That means can I take your bicycle from you and then later I'll give it back.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,580
But I want to use it.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,580
Right.

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,580
So the verb is kind of reflexive.

32
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,580
It's going on to you.

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,380
You want to borrow.

34
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,380
I want to borrow.

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,700
I want to take it from you for a short time and then I want to give it back.

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,540
So to borrow.

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,820
Now the other verb is to lend and that on the other hand goes from me to you.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,980
So you borrow my bicycle.

39
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,020
I lend you my bicycle.

40
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,300
I give it to you.

41
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
That's right.

42
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,860
So another way of asking can I borrow is can you lend me your bike?

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,420
That means can you act?

44
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,380
Can you do this thing for me?

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,840
So there's two different ways of saying it and it's very important to remember who is

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
doing what.

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Exactly.

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,940
So remember the person taking is borrowing.

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,380
The person giving is lending.

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:19,220
So it's not correct to say can you borrow me your bicycle?

51
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,220
That's not right.

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,220
No.

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,220
Can you lend me?

54
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,000
Like can you lend me a hand?

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Can you help me?

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So remember this.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
To borrow is something I do.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,380
I want to borrow from you.

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,060
It's the person, the subject in a sentence.

61
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,860
But in the case of lending, someone else is doing it.

62
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,480
So can you lend to me or can you lend it to him?

63
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
You have to say who it's being lent to.

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
Exactly.

65
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,340
And as you said who it's being lent to.

66
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,100
So the past tense of lend is lent.

67
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah.

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,420
So Marco lent me his bike last week and I broke it.

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,780
So now I have to pay him a lot of money.

70
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,580
You have to pay me five bucks and that's our next word, bucks.

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Bucks.

72
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,680
Now this is a slang term.

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,060
So this is something we say very casually in America when we want to talk about dollars.

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,420
So one buck is one dollar.

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,620
A hundred bucks is a hundred dollars.

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
All right.

77
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,060
Now as you said it's very American.

78
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,540
You wouldn't really use it like, I don't know if you're in Britain, you wouldn't say a hundred

79
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
bucks.

80
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
No, you would say quid.

81
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
Quid.

82
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Yeah, exactly.

83
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,180
So they don't have dollars so they don't say bucks.

84
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Not in England.

85
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
All right.

86
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Very good.

87
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:36,460
So we wanted to borrow five dollars and that person promised to pay you back on Tuesday.

88
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,300
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

89
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
All right.

90
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,100
So this is a lot like that verb to lend.

91
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,500
To lend him, to pay you, you have to say who you're going to pay, right?

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,580
So Marco, I'm sorry about your bicycle.

93
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,300
I will pay you back tomorrow.

94
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Okay.

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,860
That means I will give you money for it tomorrow.

96
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,100
So if you borrow money, you have to pay it back.

97
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
All right.

98
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,060
So I want to borrow five dollars.

99
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,420
I promise I will pay you back Thursday.

100
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
Very good.

101
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Okay.

102
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,940
So now lastly, we will lend money, but of course we need a guarantee.

103
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,780
We need something to make sure that you will pay me back.

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,940
So that's called collateral.

105
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
All right.

106
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,180
Now collateral is important because sometimes you can't trust someone, like you say, Marco.

107
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,700
And so for example, if I want to rent a bicycle, so I want to use it for the day, maybe there's

108
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,900
a store that they rent bicycles to people.

109
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,740
I would give my passport or my driver's license as collateral because I will definitely return

110
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,500
to take my driver's license or passport back.

111
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:51,140
So that's basically a sign of a promise, money or identification or some object.

112
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
That's right.

113
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,380
So usually, for example, if you're going to get a very big loan at the bank, they will

114
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,900
ask you for something as collateral.

115
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,220
So maybe you will have to give them your house as collateral.

116
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,900
So you're saying if I can't pay you back, then you can take my house.

117
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
That's right.

118
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,480
So collateral is the last word in language takeaway, but we do have some great phrases

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,100
for you coming up in Fluency Builder.

120
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:20,620
Can I borrow five bucks?

121
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,620
No.

122
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Come on.

123
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,180
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

124
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,660
Last time I lent you money, you never paid me back.

125
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,820
I promise if you lend me five dollars today, I will repay you in full next week.

126
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,780
OK, but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

127
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,780
Fine.

128
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,380
I can't believe you don't trust me.

129
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,900
It's nothing personal, just business.

130
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,500
All right, we're back.

131
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,180
So let's take a look at these phrases on Fluency Builder.

132
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,180
Fluency Builder.

133
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,740
So, Marco, these are two friends talking and the way they talk to each other is very casual,

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,540
so we hear at the beginning, can I borrow five bucks?

135
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
No.

136
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,540
Come on.

137
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Right.

138
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
So what is this?

139
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Come on.

140
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,500
It's a persuasive phrase.

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,020
It's one of those phrases where you're trying to convince or persuade people and you can

142
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,180
use it as an interjection in many situations.

143
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,300
So for example, here, come on, lend it to me.

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Lend me some money.

145
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
I'll pay you back.

146
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
You're trying to convince that person.

147
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Please.

148
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Yeah, exactly.

149
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,420
But what about this situation?

150
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,540
I'm running late.

151
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:32,860
I have to go and my friend, she's still sitting at her desk, maybe at work and it's taking

152
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
forever.

153
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
I say, come on, let's go.

154
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
Right.

155
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
It's like, hurry up, move it.

156
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
All right.

157
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,140
So it's a way of getting someone to do something.

158
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,220
You want them to follow you.

159
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
Exactly.

160
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,420
And now talking about money again, the person promised to repay the money.

161
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,980
He said, I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

162
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,740
But then he also said, I will repay you in full next week.

163
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
In full.

164
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Now, remember, this is important.

165
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,540
I will repay you in full.

166
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,580
That means I won't repay you a little bit and then a little bit later.

167
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,660
I will repay you everything next week.

168
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Right, exactly.

169
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,380
So if you have to pay or repay someone in full, you have to give them the entire amount,

170
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,900
not just a part of it.

171
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
That's right.

172
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
In full.

173
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,900
Full means everything.

174
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,180
The final phrase is the very last line of today's dialogue.

175
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,580
It's nothing personal.

176
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,660
It's just business.

177
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,980
I think this is a common phrase that people use when maybe doing business with friends

178
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,940
or people you know.

179
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,020
Maybe you're asking for collateral and the guy's like, I can't believe you don't trust

180
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
me.

181
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
I'm your brother.

182
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
And he's like, it's nothing personal.

183
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
It's just business.

184
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,400
It's a way to say, listen, this is not about you and me.

185
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,500
This is about my rules.

186
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,980
And when I give something to someone, I always ask for collateral.

187
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
So it's just business.

188
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,300
It's just my way of doing this.

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Exactly.

190
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,020
So it's a good phrase to use if you're doing maybe business with a friend.

191
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,540
And of course, maybe you're setting these rules and maybe your friend feels a little

192
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
bit offended.

193
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,500
You say, hey, it's nothing personal.

194
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
It's just business.

195
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Nothing personal.

196
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,860
So that's the last phrase.

197
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,580
Let's take a listen to the dialogue again and we'll be right back.

198
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,700
Can I borrow five bucks?

199
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
No.

200
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Come on.

201
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,340
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

202
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,820
Last time I lent you money, you never paid me back.

203
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,060
I promise if you lend me five dollars today, I will repay you in full next week.

204
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,940
OK, but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

205
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Fine.

206
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,540
I can't believe you don't trust me.

207
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,940
It's nothing personal.

208
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Just business.

209
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
All right.

210
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,740
So lending money, borrowing money.

211
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,420
Now, as we mentioned, sometimes you have people that ask you for money.

212
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,300
Now, did you ever have that friend that always asked you for money and never repaid you?

213
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Yes.

214
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Like a dollar at a time.

215
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Hey, can I borrow a dollar?

216
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Can I borrow five dollars?

217
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Yeah, always.

218
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,340
And actually this friend, he would borrow ten dollars and he'd say, oh, I'll buy you

219
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
a coffee tomorrow.

220
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,240
I say, what, a ten dollar coffee?

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
I don't think so.

222
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,020
So it was always uneven.

223
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,220
And I paid more and he never repaid me in full.

224
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Right.

225
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
So, yeah.

226
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,500
And actually, I think if you add up all those little that little amount of money that maybe

227
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,340
some friends borrowed from you, it would be quite a decent amount.

228
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,300
I had many friends who would be like, hey, can I borrow a dollar or, you know, even like

229
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,220
25 cents at a time.

230
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
It would add up over time.

231
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,220
After a couple of years.

232
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,820
Yeah, that's that's like a whole dinner.

233
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Exactly.

234
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,620
So what do you call these people?

235
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,700
The word in English that's a slang word is called a mooch.

236
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
A mooch.

237
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
He's a mooch.

238
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,340
It means he's always taking money from people or asking other people to pay for his dinner

239
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,540
or staying at someone's house.

240
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,620
So a mooch is someone who tries to get things for free.

241
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Right.

242
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
That's exactly it.

243
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,140
I had friends like this that would for food as well.

244
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,020
Like maybe I brought my lunch.

245
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,520
This is in school, obviously.

246
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,340
And they would mooch off me like half my sandwich or half my juice.

247
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
Can I have some chips?

248
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Can I have some juice?

249
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
Yeah, exactly.

250
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
So that's the mooch behavior.

251
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,260
So that's the verb to mooch off someone.

252
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,540
Yeah, to mooch off someone.

253
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
But it's also a noun.

254
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,540
He's a mooch.

255
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,660
He's a mooch.

256
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Very interesting stuff.

257
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,460
Maybe you have a friend that was a mooch or maybe even yourself back in the day.

258
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,260
So let us know how it works in your country.

259
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,220
If you lend money to people, family members, do you ask for collateral?

260
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,060
Or do you just forget about it?

261
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Let us know.

262
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060

We'll see you guys there.

264

Bye.
