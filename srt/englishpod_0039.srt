1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,880
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,200
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all those elementary learners.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,600
In today's lesson, we've got some excellent language that will help you to describe someone's

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
appearance.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,160
It's something that everyone has learned before in school, describing people.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,520
So we're going to review that and give you some better phrases.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,280
Some real English phrases.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Real English phrases.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Yeah.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Okay, great.

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,720
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll come back and talk about

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,520
it.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,480
I heard you were on a date last night.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
So how did it go?

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,680
I want all the juicy details.

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,480
Um, well, actually, we had a fantastic time last night.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,880
He was amazing.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,320
Okay, now you really have to fill me in.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
What's he like?

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,080
He's really good looking.

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,560
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,240
He's in his early 30s, and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
He sounds hot.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,260
What does he do for a living?

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,460
You know what?

29
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,280
This is the best part.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,960
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,720
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
Hold on a sec.

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
His name is David?

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Yeah.

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:31,600
That's my brother!

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,360
All right, so interesting dialogue.

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Small world.

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,840
It is a small world.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know how I would feel about dating my friend's brother.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Really?

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,320
No, I wouldn't feel good about it.

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Why?

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,280
Well, because if you break up with the brother, then like, that means you'll have to end the

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,400
friendship with your best friend.

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Maybe.

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Dangerous.

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Girls are more complicated with that.

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,000
We guys, we're not that complicated.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,760
Well, you know what?

50
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,440
Let's look at the language before this gets too far.

51
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,960
All right.

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
Let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,480
Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,960
On Language Takeaway today, we're bringing you three words.

55
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
The first one is heard.

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Heard.

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Heard.

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Heard.

59
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,920
So you guys know this word.

60
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
It's a substance of hear, right?

61
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Right.

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,040
But the way it's used is quite interesting.

63
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,320
Let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used.

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,040
Example one.

65
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,280
I heard you're dating a new guy.

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Example two.

67
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,440
Julie told me she heard that you're pregnant.

68
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,320
Example three.

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,840
What you got fired?

70
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,040
I heard that you quit.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,560
So when you say for example, oh, I heard you were pregnant.

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Whoa.

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,600
This is like telling someone that you found some information about them, but you're not

74
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,440
sure if it's true or if it's false.

75
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Exactly.

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Okay.

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Our next word, fill me in.

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Fill me in.

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,880
Fill me in.

80
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Fill me in.

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,960
So when you tell someone to fill you in.

82
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,520
You're saying tell me about it.

83
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Tell me the details.

84
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,480
I could say, I'm sorry I was late for the meeting.

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Can you fill me in on what happened?

86
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Exactly.

87
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,960
Or I could say, I missed the first five minutes of the movie.

88
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Fill me in.

89
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Exactly.

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay.

91
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Great word.

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,240
And our last phrase today, career path.

93
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
Career path.

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Career path.

95
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Career path.

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,640
So what's a career path?

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,640
I guess this is the plan for your job over several like 10 or 20 years.

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Right.

99
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,720
So the jobs and things you do during your career.

100
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Yeah.

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
That's your career path.

102
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,960
So in this case, David has a really good career path because he's going to be a really rich

103
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,480
and powerful investment banker.

104
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
Yes.

105
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,760
So career path.

106
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Very good.

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
So now let's listen to our dialogue again and pay special attention to the language

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:15,160
used to describe David because when we come back, we're going to talk about this.

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,840
Irene, I heard you were on a date last night.

110
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,280
So how did it go?

111
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,160
I want all the juicy details.

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,560
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

113
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,760
He was amazing.

114
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,560
Okay.

115
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,840
Now you really have to fill me in.

116
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,880
What's he like?

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,160
He's really good looking.

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,640
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

119
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,160
He's in his early 30s and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,360
He sounds hot.

121
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,620
What does he do for a living?

122
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,360
You know what, this is the best part.

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,200
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank.

124
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,440
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

125
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,080
Hold on a sec.

126
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,280
His name is David?

127
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,720
Yeah.

128
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:30,040
That's my brother.

129
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,920
So we found some really great words and phrases used to describe someone.

130
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Exactly.

131
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,240
There's a lot of language in here talking about the way someone looks.

132
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,600
So let's listen again as Irene describes David.

133
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,880
He's really good looking.

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,360
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

135
00:05:50,360 --> 00:06:00,280
He's in his early 30s and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

136
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,560
He's really good looking.

137
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,040
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

138
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,040
He's in his early 30s and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,400
Okay.

140
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,040
So let's break this down.

141
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,300
The first thing she says is, he's really good looking.

142
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Good looking.

143
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Good looking.

144
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Good looking.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,240
So good looking is the equivalent of handsome.

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Or pretty.

147
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Pretty.

148
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Yeah.

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Good looking.

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,640
But I think good looking sounds a lot more natural than handsome.

151
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Yeah.

152
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
You wouldn't really use handsome.

153
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,880
Like I would never say that.

154
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Even though it's correct.

155
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
It's just good looking sounds much more natural.

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160
I guess for me, whenever someone says handsome, it sounds like an older person.

157
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Yeah.

158
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
It sounds old fashioned.

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
Like my grandma would say, oh he's a handsome young man.

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Yeah.

161
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Exactly.

162
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Okay.

163
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,680
So she says, he's quite tall.

164
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Quite tall.

165
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Quite tall.

166
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Quite tall.

167
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,680
So we know quite means very.

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Yeah.

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
And tall, we know.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
So you can describe a person in different ways.

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah.

173
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
He's quite tall.

174
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
He's kind of tall.

175
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
He's sort of tall.

176
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,480
He's a bit short.

177
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,800
He's not that short.

178
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Yeah.

179
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Okay.

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
So these are great words we can use to describe someone's height.

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Okay.

182
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Then, she talked about his exact height.

183
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Yes.

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Right.

185
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
She said he was 6'1".

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
6'1".

187
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Around 6'1".

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Yeah.

189
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,200
This is interesting because in the United States and Canada, you give a person's height

190
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,280
using feet and inches.

191
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
That's right.

192
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Right.

193
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,320
So we don't talk about meters and centimeters.

194
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Right.

195
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,920
So 6'1 would be 6 feet 1 inch.

196
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Exactly.

197
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,280
But in other countries, you would talk about centimeters or meters.

198
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,360
So 6'1 is like, 6'1 is about 180.

199
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah.

200
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
About that.

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,800
So this is an interesting difference between...

202
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,560
Like English-speaking countries and European countries.

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Right.

204
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Okay.

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,880
So the next time you give your height to someone, make sure you do it in feet more

206
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
or less.

207
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
It sounds a lot more natural.

208
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,840
And actually, if you say to somebody in Canada, for example, I'm 175 centimeters, they wouldn't

209
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
know really how tall that was.

210
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,480
How tall that is.

211
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Yeah.

212
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Okay.

213
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Now, the next part is really, really useful.

214
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,240
She said he's in his early 30s.

215
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
In his early 30s.

216
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
His early 30s.

217
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
Early 30s.

218
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,760
So this is a way of describing someone's age without actually giving the exact number.

219
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Exactly.

220
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,260
So for example, early 30s.

221
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,000
So like 32, 33.

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Mid 30s.

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Like 34, 35, 36.

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, 36.

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And then late 30s would be?

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
38, 39.

228
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
And you could do the same thing for...

229
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Like 40s.

230
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
40s, 50s, 60s.

231
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
20s.

232
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
20s.

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah.

234
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Yeah.

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
20s.

236
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
You wouldn't do this before your 20s.

237
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I don't think it's really common to talk about your teens.

238
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Right.

239
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
You wouldn't say like his mid-teens or early teens.

240
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Yeah.

241
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Sounds a bit weird.

242
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Okay.

243
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,960
Great language used to describe people.

244
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
But one more word.

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Right.

246
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
He's hot.

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
He's hot.

248
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Or he sounds hot.

249
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Yeah.

250
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
He's hot.

251
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Yeah.

252
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,480
So this is another sort of informal way of describing someone who's really good-looking.

253
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Good-looking.

254
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Really sexy.

255
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Right.

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
He's hot.

257
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
He's hot.

258
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Yeah.

259
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
But it is informal.

260
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
It is really informal.

261
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Maybe even a little bit offensive.

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
You wouldn't go up to a girl and say, wow, you're hot.

263
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
No.

264
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
It's a little bit too impolite.

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Right.

266
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
You would say, wow, you're really pretty or you're gorgeous.

267
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
But you wouldn't say, wow, you're hot.

268
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
No.

269
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
You would never say that to somebody.

270
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Right.

271
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,040
That's something you would comment with your friends.

272
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Yeah.

273
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Okay.

274
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
So we've looked at some really good language for describing people.

275
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:55,520
Now we could listen to our dialogue a third time and I'm sure you will understand everything.

276
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I heard you were on a date last night.

277
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
So how did it go?

278
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,720
I want all the juicy details.

279
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,520
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

280
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
He was amazing.

281
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,720
Okay.

282
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Now you really have to fill me in.

283
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
What's he like?

284
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
He's really good looking.

285
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
He's quite tall, around 6'1".

286
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,720
He's in his early 30s and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
He sounds hot.

288
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
What does he do for a living?

289
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
You know what?

290
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
This is the best part.

291
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank.

292
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,720
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Hold on a sec.

294
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
His name is David?

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah.

296
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,720
That's my brother.

297
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Okay, so we looked at really useful language for describing people and we want you to describe

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
your girlfriend, boyfriend.

299
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Or even yourself.

300
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Or even yourself.

301
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
What do you look like?

302
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
How tall are you?

303
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
How old are you?

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
How old are you?

305
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah.

306
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
And try and use the language from today's lesson.

307
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Right.

308
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,720
So come to EnglishPod.com and leave your questions and comments on our website.

309
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
And your descriptions.

310
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
And your description.

311
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
And we'll definitely be there to answer any doubts as well.

312
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Yes.

313
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Well guys, thanks for listening today.

314
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
And until next time, goodbye.

315
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Bye.

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:33,720
And until next time, goodbye.
