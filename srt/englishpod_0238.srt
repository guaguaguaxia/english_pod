00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,500
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,140
My name is Catherine and today we're bringing you another elementary level lesson as a part

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,060
of our interview series.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,060
That's right.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,960
This is part two of the interview series and the last part we talked about, well, a brief

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,440
introduction when you arrive to a job interview.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,480
But on this occasion, we're going to talk a little bit about yourself and your life.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
That's right.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,120
That's the most personal part, I think, of an interview.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,240
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,160
the things that you've heard.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,480
Now, Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I've had a chance to look it over.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,160
I must say I'm quite impressed.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,400
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,880
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,520
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
overview.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,040
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,360
Yes, of course.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,720
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,880
our family moved to London when I was quite young at around 16.

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,840
Ah, I see.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
So you were actually educated in Europe.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Yes, precisely.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,160
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,440
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
in Saudi Arabia, too.

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,080
Very interesting.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,520
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Absolutely.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,160
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
I see.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Okay.

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,760
Well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,120
Sure.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,280
Alright, we're back.

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,960
So obviously this person had a very interesting life and they use some pretty interesting

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
words there.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,880
So why don't we take a look at five key words that we have prepared for you on Language

43
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,420
Takeaway.

44
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:19,160
Alright, so the first word that we have is right when Mr. Parsons talked to Miss Childs

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,800
and he said that he was very impressed with her resume.

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,880
Alright, so someone says I'm impressed when they think that something that you did or

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,600
something about you is very interesting or good or better than most people's.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
That's right.

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,200
So you're kind of amazed, you're kind of, you're like, wow.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,160
And so this is an adjective.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,040
I am impressed.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
That's right.

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
So teachers sometimes say this.

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,840
Maybe when you do really, really, really well on a test, they say, hey, Marco, I'm really

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
impressed.

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,600
You got 99%.

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,320
Parents say this to friends, family.

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,000
So basically this is a way to say good job.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wow.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Right.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And there's also a verb.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,840
So this is the adjective to be impressed and the verb form would be to impress someone.

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,000
So that's obviously if you impress your teacher by studying, your teacher will be impressed.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,840
And following that, Mr. Parson has some questions about Miss Child's background.

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
That's right.

68
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,120
He asked her for a brief overview of her background.

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,880
So we have two interesting words there.

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
An overview.

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
What is an overview?

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,280
An overview is like a summary.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,080
It's basically a way to ask for someone to give you a lot of information in very few

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
words.

75
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
That's right.

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
So you don't really want too much details.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,040
You don't want somebody to tell you their life in detail.

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
You just want a brief summary.

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Right.

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,200
So not, I was born on August 11th in 1979 and I was and then I went into this.

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,240
No, this is basic, simple, you know, this is where I'm from.

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,840
This is where I went to school at the end.

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
And well, he wanted a brief overview of her background.

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,440
What exactly is her background?

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,760
Well think about the word back.

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Okay.

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,960
That means behind or in this case, background is your personal history.

88
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,020
So you could ask someone, what's your background?

89
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,200
It means where are you from or you know, what have you been doing up to now in your life?

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
That's right.

91
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,720
And precisely when he asked her about her background, now she's starting to talk about

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,160
her life in general terms.

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,680
As we said, it's an overview.

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,720
So she said that she's 27 and she's from Brooklyn, etc.

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,960
So she starts giving very general information about herself and her life.

96
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Exactly.

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,280
And when she starts to do this, Mr. Parson has more specific questions about her life

98
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,340
because he wants to know details.

99
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,440
So he asks her then where she was educated.

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,520
So this this phrase to be educated is very important.

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
That's right.

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,620
So he's asking her, you studied in Europe.

103
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,620
That's right.

104
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,380
To be educated means to have someone teach you or to go to school somewhere.

105
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,080
So for example, I was educated in America.

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
Where were you educated, Marco?

107
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,040
I was educated in Chile.

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Wow.

109
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,720
So you've been educated in a number of different places, right?

110
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,440
At home and in a different country.

111
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Right.

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,600
But you can also specify the university name, right?

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
For example, I was educated at Harvard.

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Can you say that?

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
You can.

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,280
Or I was educated at a number of different schools.

117
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,160
So you can say I studied or I was educated.

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
All right.

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
And well, apparently she was moving around from Europe, United States.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,520
So Mr. Parson says, wow, it seems that you had an adventurous childhood.

121
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Okay.

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,000
This is a great adjective, adventurous.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
You can say a person is adventurous.

124
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
So Marco is very adventurous.

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
He likes to jump out of airplanes.

126
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,040
But you can also say that an experience is adventurous, like moving around a lot as a

127
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
child.

128
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Right.

129
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,960
So I guess adventurous can go hand in hand with exciting or very interesting, full of

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
emotion.

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
That's right.

132
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,680
So adventure, adventurous.

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
So a person can be adventurous.

134
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,680
And we actually had a lesson about this when we describe personalities.

135
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
You can say someone is adventurous.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Exactly.

137
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
All right.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Very good.

139
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
So five key words that we just took a look at.

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:34,160
bit more on Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
Now Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I've had a chance to look it over.

143
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,720
I must say I'm quite impressed.

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Thank you very much.

145
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,960
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

146
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,480
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

147
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,080
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief

148
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
overview.

149
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,600
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,920
Yes, of course.

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,200
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

152
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Although our family moved to London when I was quite young.

153
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,360
At around 16.

154
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,400
Ah, I see.

155
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,560
So you were actually educated in Europe.

156
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,960
Yes, precisely.

157
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,760
Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

158
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,720
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,800
My father was in the oil business before he retired.

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,000
So we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,620
Very interesting.

162
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,040
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

163
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Absolutely.

164
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
We were never still for too long.

165
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,080
But now I'm really looking to settle down.

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
I see.

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,640
Okay, well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

168
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Sure.

169
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,680
All right, we're back.

170
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,080
So we have four phrases for you on Fluency Builder prepared.

171
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,080
And let's start on with the first one.

172
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Fluency Builder.

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,640
Okay, so the very beginning, Mr. Parsons is continuing what he was saying in our first

174
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
part.

175
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:08,160
So Mr. Parsons is talking about Rebecca's resume and he says, someone, the secretary,

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,880
she passed it on to me.

177
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,280
So this verb, to pass on, this is really important.

178
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
What does this mean?

179
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,900
Well, the secretary, Ms. Childs, passed on Rebecca's resume.

180
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:27,260
That basically means she, Ms. Childs received it and she didn't keep it.

181
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,800
She passed it on or she gave it to another person.

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,680
In this case, Mr. Parsons.

183
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay, so this implies, this shows that something doesn't stay with one person, like you said,

184
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,880
Marco, but it moves from one person to another person.

185
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,320
So for example, my mother told me to pass this message on to you.

186
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
The message is not for me, it's for you.

187
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,040
I think also with physical traits, like maybe if your mother had green eyes, you can maybe

188
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,040
say my mom passed on her eye color on to me.

189
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
That's right.

190
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,760
So, you got it from her.

191
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,840
Alright, so that's what happened with the resume and he said, well, she passed it on

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,080
and I've had the chance to look it over.

193
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,960
Okay, so think about this as a chunk, as a group of words that we use together to look

194
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
something over.

195
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,920
We can say, hey, Marco, when you have a minute, can you look this over for me?

196
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,560
Okay, so that means to examine or to take a look.

197
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,640
Take a look at, that's right.

198
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,360
So to look something over or to look it over.

199
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,680
Alright, so basically to examine, maybe in close detail, right?

200
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,440
You actually take the time to read it.

201
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
That's right.

202
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Okay.

203
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,160
And then later on, they started talking about her background.

204
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,560
As we know, she was from Brooklyn, she grew up in Brooklyn and then she moved to London.

205
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,720
And so Rebecca described how she spent most of her life moving from country to country.

206
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,140
Okay, from country to country.

207
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,600
This means that she moved to many different countries.

208
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Okay, so if I live in America all my life, I never moved from country to country.

209
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,240
You can say this about many different things, from place to place, from town to town.

210
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,160
It means that you live in one, you go from one place to another.

211
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
That's right.

212
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,080
So as you said, if you replace the noun country, you can say from town to town.

213
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,160
You can even say from house to house.

214
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,760
I went from house to house asking for money.

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
That's right.

216
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,320
So from to.

217
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Exactly.

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,160
So from something to something.

219
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,800
And for our final phrase, she was talking about how she's moved around so much that

220
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,080
she's actually ready to settle down.

221
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,560
Okay, to settle down.

222
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,080
This is a really important phrase and I think it's something a lot of people do when they're

223
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,320
maybe in their 30s or 40s.

224
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,520
They don't want to move anymore.

225
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,800
So to settle down means to stay in one place.

226
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Exactly.

227
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,120
So you stay in one place.

228
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,840
And it can have a lot of different meanings as well.

229
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,280
For example, to get married, many people say that's settling down.

230
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,320
It means you want to stay in one place and have a family.

231
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
Or to buy a house because it means that you will live there for a long time.

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Exactly.

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
So to settle down.

234
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,400
So a lot of interesting phrases there, a lot of words and this is, as we said, part two

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
of our series.

236
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,280
So I think it would be worthy for us to listen to this dialogue one last time and we'll be

237
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:34,680
back to talk a little bit more.

238
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,560
Now Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I've had a chance to look it over.

239
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,240
I must say I'm quite impressed.

240
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Thank you very much.

241
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

242
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,000
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
overview.

245
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,320
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

246
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
Yes, of course.

247
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,800
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although

248
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,920
our family moved to London when I was quite young at around 16.

249
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
I see.

250
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,080
So you were actually educated in Europe.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,480
Yes, precisely.

252
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,280
Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

253
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,240
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

254
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,480
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years

255
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
in Saudi Arabia too.

256
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,120
Very interesting.

257
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Absolutely.

259
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,600
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

260
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I see.

261
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Okay.

262
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,760
Well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

263
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,520
Sure.

264
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,200
Alright, we're back.

265
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,240
So this is part two of a 10-part series of the interviews.

266
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Now we just talked about the background, and I think there are different ways of talking

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,340
about your background, right?

268
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,560
This is maybe your personal background.

269
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
That's right.

270
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
So you can talk about your personal history, your personal background, where you were born,

271
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,080
where you were educated, where you grew up.

272
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,920
But a lot of times we also have to talk about other parts of our background, like our work

273
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,520
background or like next week, our educational background.

274
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
That's right.

275
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,040
So part three, we're going to take a look at your educational background.

276
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,000
And it's going to be very important because I think in many interviews, people have a

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,160
hard time describing what they studied or maybe describing exactly what they did during

278
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,920
university or college or master's degree or something.

279
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Exactly.

280
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,880
And we're not talking about elementary school or high school.

281
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
We're specifically talking about university background here.

282
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
So like you're saying, Marco, what was your major?

283
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,520
What was your minor?

284
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
What was your area of study?

285
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,320
These are great, great, great phrases that are very important for an interview.

286
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,480
And so we hope that if you have any questions, you'll let us know.

287
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,120
Our website is EnglishPod.com and stay tuned for next week's episode.

288
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
That's right.

289
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Okay.

290
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,920
So we'll see everyone on the website and until next time.

291
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Bye.

292
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:18,960
Thanks everyone.
