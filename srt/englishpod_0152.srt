00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,960
And my name is Kathryn.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
So, as usual, we've got a great dialogue for you today.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
And before we get going, I should mention what the topic is.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
So, Marco, take it away.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,960
We are actually having a small fight at the office.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,400
Somebody or a coworker is annoying us.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,800
So, you know, sometimes coworkers, you see them every day, they're doing something that's

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,440
maybe getting on your nerves.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,440
And you practically live together because you're with each other for eight, nine, ten

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,000
hours every day.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Exactly.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,100
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,840
Some language related to this topic.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,920
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Cut what out?

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm not doing anything.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
The tapping of your pen on your desk.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,720
It's driving me crazy.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,800
Fine.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,440
By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,360
I don't slurp my coffee.

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,040
And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,680
You've got to be kidding me.

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,880
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,520
ten times a day to shoot the breeze?

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,800
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions.

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,200
And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,080
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Fine.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Let's call it truce.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,040
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,200
So I was wondering, you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,080
All right, we're back.

39
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,600
So yeah, I think this is a common situation, right?

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,720
So common, this might even be based on our own lives.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
It is.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
You may not know, but Catherine and I get into fights all the time.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
All the time.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
No, not really.

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,120
All right, so I think there was some interesting words here, but mostly phrases.

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,200
So let's start with the words first on language takeaway.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Language takeaway.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,960
All right, so the first word, as you might have guessed, has to do with eating and drinking.

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,840
This is called slurping.

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
To slurp.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
To slurp.

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
So the noun, the thing is slurping.

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,920
And it's very common with people who eat their food quickly.

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Like soup.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,300
Yeah, soup or, you know, yeah, or when they're eating soup noodles.

56
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,800
Or sometimes when you have a drink and you're drinking it through a straw, towards the end,

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,760
you're just like trying to get the very last part at the bottom.

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,520
So yeah, the straw slurps.

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah, so slurping, some people really can't stand it.

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Sometimes you don't even notice that you're doing it.

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
No, absolutely not.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,440
All right, so apart from slurping, what else do we have?

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,000
We've got a great word here, accumulated.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,160
So a lot of accumulated anger.

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,200
The word is a verb, to accumulate.

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
And what does that mean?

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,920
It means to kind of grow or to become more and more.

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
All right.

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
So you're like saving it.

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,600
Or even it's like building up.

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,320
You know, we say this oftentimes in Chicago where it snows a lot in the winter, that there's

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,680
a foot of snow accumulated on the ground.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,800
That means there's a lot of snow and every time it snows, it keeps getting bigger.

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah.

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,160
So to accumulate.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,960
So accumulated anger, your anger is getting bigger and bigger.

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,080
Right, because you never tell anyone about your anger.

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,760
So it keeps building and it keeps piling up.

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
All right.

80
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,060
Well, towards the end, they said, well, let's call a truce.

81
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,360
So they want to call a truce.

82
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,160
All right, a truce is another word for a peace.

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,960
And so this is a way that you can stop fighting and say that you and I have been fighting

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
for a long time.

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,840
We may not come to a deal, but we'll say truce from now on.

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
We just won't fight.

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
We won't fight about it.

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Okay.

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,560
Brothers and sisters often call truces.

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Truce.

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,240
And well, if you're calling a truce, you're trying to be more considerate.

92
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Okay.

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,560
Considerate, like you're saying, is a way to be or a way to act.

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,040
And considerate often has to do with how you act towards other people.

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
So it's being nice to other people or thinking about other people's feelings before yourself.

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
All right.

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,360
So if you're considerate, then you are maybe more polite.

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,040
You think about the other person's feelings before you do anything.

99
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Exactly.

100
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,440
You just say nice little things like please and thank you and I'm sorry.

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,600
And these things are all ways of being considerate.

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Very good.

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
All right.

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,720
So four great words on language takeaway.

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,440
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder.

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Fluency Builder.

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,960
All right.

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,620
So as we mentioned, this dialogue is very, very rich in a lot of different phrases.

109
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,360
So let's start with a couple of them.

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,560
The very first one and the title of the lesson, cut it out.

111
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Cut that out.

112
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Right.

114
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,720
So you're not actually saying to cut something with scissors or something.

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,600
No, this is, it's a way of saying, can you stop that?

116
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Stop it.

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Stop doing that.

118
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Stop it.

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Quit it.

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Okay.

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Cut that out.

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Cut it out.

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
So if someone's doing something that's really annoying to you, it's not very nice to say,

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
but you can say, hey, cut that out.

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Cut it out.

126
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,600
Or if someone's doing something mean to someone, like my brother used to hit me, my mom would

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,960
say, Peter, cut that out.

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,160
All right.

129
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
So it is a good mom phrase as well.

130
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
All right.

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Moving on to our next phrase.

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
The guy said that the tapping on the desk was driving him crazy.

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,120
It's driving me crazy.

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,160
All right.

135
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,040
To drive someone crazy means to make someone just feel like they're going nuts or, you

136
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,160
know, it just, it makes you kind of angry or frustrated or tense.

137
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,600
But it can also be used like in a romantic sense, right?

138
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
That girl drives me crazy.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
It means like he can't even think about anything else.

140
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
All right.

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,280
So in this case, what drives you crazy?

142
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,520
When...

143
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,680
I'll tell you what drives me crazy.

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,840
When people clip their fingernails and toenails at the office.

145
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800
I can't believe.

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,440
Well, it drives me crazy.

147
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,560
Like for example, when somebody or my brother leaves his clothes lying on the floor in the

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
living room.

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
That's annoying too.

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah.

151
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Yeah.

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
So that drives me crazy.

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
All right.

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,000
So moving on to our third phrase, this is a pretty big one, but take it as a whole.

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,520
You've got to be kidding me.

156
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
All right.

157
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,000
So this is, as you said, a fixed phrase.

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,680
These words usually go together and it is a perfect example of sarcasm.

159
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
So it's a way...

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
The way you say it is very important.

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,080
So I could say, you've got to be kidding me.

162
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,240
What's a good situation for this?

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,200
Maybe I get to the airport and I'm running late and I'm really happy that I get there

164
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,000
on time and then I see the flight is delayed seven hours.

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
You've got to be kidding me.

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Right.

167
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,280
Or something I can't believe it or seriously, this isn't... yeah.

168
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
What's happening?

169
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Or what bad luck.

170
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Right.

171
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,880
So it is a sarcastic phrase, but use it as a whole.

172
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,520
Usually you don't change the subject.

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
You don't say, you've got to be kidding him.

174
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
No, it's always this.

175
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
You've got to be kidding me.

176
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
All right.

177
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,240
Or you've got to be kidding me.

178
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,400
See?

179
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Different meetings with different inflections.

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Different inflections.

181
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,240
Very good.

182
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,800
What's our next phrase?

183
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,760
Our next phrase is a good one because it doesn't mean what it sounds like.

184
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Okay?

185
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,360
So, to shoot the breeze.

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,920
All right?

187
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,840
Shoot means like you can shoot a gun and breeze is like the wind.

188
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,640
But here to shoot the breeze is to have a nice little conversation, just to talk about

189
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
nothing.

190
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Okay.

191
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,160
So not really do anything, just talk a little bit.

192
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Right.

193
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,520
So if we think about this in the context of this sentence, it's, you know, you go out

194
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,960
for your cigarette break 10 times a day to shoot the breeze.

195
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Okay.

196
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,920
So shoot means you go outside, you just talk about nothing and whatever and it's almost

197
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,440
like you're wasting time just talking.

198
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Okay.

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
So shooting the breeze.

200
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,760
You can say, oh, we were just shooting the breeze.

201
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,720
Just have a nice little conversation.

202
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Nothing important.

203
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay.

204
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,800
And our last phrase for today.

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Forgive and forget.

206
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Let's forgive and forget.

207
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Let's forgive and forget.

208
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,840
This is, these words again, like the last phrases go together.

209
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Forgive and forget.

210
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
So I could say this to you, Marco.

211
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,720
I say, I know you've been fighting with your brother for 10 years.

212
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,160
I say finally just forgive and forget.

213
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,520
It means just put everything behind you and try and start again.

214
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Okay.

215
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Let it go.

216
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Yeah.

217
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Forgive the person, forget about it, move on.

218
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Okay.

219
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,680
Forgive and forget.

220
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Very good.

221
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
So very interesting phrases.

222
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,120
I think they're very useful and this is very colloquial English, right?

223
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Absolutely.

224
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,800
This is stuff that you're going to hear all the time, but maybe not all together at the

225
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
same time.

226
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,080
Definitely though, very helpful for interacting with foreign friends and colleagues.

227
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Very good.

228
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,520
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

229
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:06,480
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

230
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Cut what out?

231
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
I'm not doing anything.

232
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,560
The tapping of your pen on your desk.

233
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,240
It's driving me crazy.

234
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Fine.

235
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,000
By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
I don't slurp my coffee.

237
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,560
Plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,200
You've got to be kidding me.

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,400
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break

240
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,080
10 times a day to shoot the breeze?

241
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,480
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions and it's probably

242
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,600
okay to let off steam once in a while, but it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

243
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

244
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Fine.

245
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Let's call it truce.

246
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,760
I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

247
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,240
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:07,160
So I was wondering, you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

249
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,080
So did you ever see the TV show Full House when you were a kid?

250
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
I did.

251
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
I did.

252
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,080
It was popular with the Olsen twins and all of those, right?

253
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Yeah.

254
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,200
I think it, so there was an uncle on the show, Uncle Joey, and he always used to say, cut

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
it out.

256
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
And he had like hand motions for it.

257
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,120
And so cut it out as a way to say kind of stop it, quit it.

258
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
You're killing me.

259
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,640
It's like he was saying too funny.

260
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,640
And so whenever I hear this phrase, I always think of that early 90s TV show.

261
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,920
Very early 90s.

262
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,440
Well, this whole situation with The Office as well, I think there was a TV show called

263
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
The Office, right?

264
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah, there was the British Office and then there was an American version.

265
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,160
And it's also something about office life and how colleagues get on each other's nerves

266
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,760
and they play pranks on each other and everyone's kind of weird.

267
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,280
And everyone drives everyone else crazy.

268
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Exactly.

269
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,200
No, it's funny because once you start working in an office full time, I mean, everyone's

270
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,480
maybe had a little bit of office experience, but when it's full time, you spend more time

271
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,560
with your colleagues than you do with your family.

272
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,560
It's really amazing what makes you crazy, what drives you crazy and what stuff just

273
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
doesn't matter.

274
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
So this is an interesting topic.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,360
We really want to hear from you guys.

276
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,720
Many of you probably work at an office, so tell us.

277
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
So come and tell us what drives you crazier.

278
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,160
Maybe what colleague is driving you mad.

279
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,200
You don't have to use names.

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
You can just use nicknames if you want.

281
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Right.

282
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,920
So we'll be waiting for you at EnglishPod.com.

283
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,560
Leave questions and comments and we'll see you guys next time.

284
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Yep.

285
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Bye.

286
00:11:46,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Bye.
