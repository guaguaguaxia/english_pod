00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,520
And my name is Katherine and today we've got a great lesson for you about traveling

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,000
and getting directions.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,680
So sometimes we are looking for an address, we are looking for our friend's house and

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,840
we can't find it.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,840
So what do you have to do?

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,680
You have to stop and ask someone for directions.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,240
There's actually a joke in many countries that men hate to ask for directions.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,400
And so this is the women's approach, asking and getting directions and finally finding

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
your way.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
So it's a good thing.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,880
That's a very good thing.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,280
So we're going to jump right into the dialogue.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:49,920
Let's see what happens here and if they can find the place they're looking for.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,040
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,180
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,600
We are not lost.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm just taking the scenic route.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,440
Yeah, whatever.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,320
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,480
But would you listen to me?

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,640
No, this is so typical.

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Fine.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,480
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Excuse me, sir.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,760
Can you tell me how to get to St. Mary's Church?

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Sure.

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,600
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Thanks.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,520
See, was that hard?

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,160
If you would only listen to me more often, you'd be better off.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,560
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,600
So well, the woman was obviously a little bit angry that the guy refused to admit that

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
he was lost.

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
That's right.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
She's very frustrated.

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,720
And this has been in movies and in books and all sorts of things.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,240
This kind of story of the man not wanting to ask for directions.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,480
And so he keeps saying, listen, I've got these excuses.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm taking the scenic route, for example.

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
That's right.

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,280
And that's our first word for today on Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,040
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,960
So as you say, the scenic route, what does he mean by that?

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,360
Okay, route is like a path or a trail or kind of like the way that you go somewhere.

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
So the route to my house.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,280
But in this case, the scenic route or the scenic route, you can say in both ways, is

51
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
the most beautiful way to go.

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,280
It's usually the longer one.

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Yeah.

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
So you can say, oh, it's just the scenic route.

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
It's not really true.

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,760
It's just the longer route.

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
Right, exactly.

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,720
So that's the excuse that he's giving her.

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,960
He's like, no, I'm not lost.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,400
We're taking longer because, well, we're taking the beautiful route.

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,080
All right, with all the trees and the animals and the lakes.

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
No, I don't.

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
I don't buy it.

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
I don't believe this.

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
That's right.

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
I don't believe it.

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
I don't believe it.

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Whatever.

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
You know what?

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
We need a GPS.

71
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay, GPS, global positioning system.

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,280
So many people have these in their cars these days.

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,680
This is like an electronic map that will use your location to show you where to go.

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
It's very useful.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,560
And especially in places like the United States that have streets that are clearly marked

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,800
and it's just a little bit easier to get around.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,840
You can just get in your car, type in the address you want to go to and the thing talks

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
to you.

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,160
It says turn left, go straight, turn right.

80
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Creepy.

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,600
So this is a very useful device.

82
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,240
It's like a computer that you use in your computer, a GPS.

83
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,320
All right, so she's talking about the GPS and then at the end of that line, she says,

84
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,440
this is so typical.

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
So what?

86
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Getting lost.

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,720
All right, getting lost is so typical.

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,680
So something that is typical is common.

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
This is so normal.

90
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,080
This is so typical.

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
This is so something you normally do.

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,860
So what other examples could we give with the word typical?

93
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,860
Something that is typical?

94
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,520
Okay, well, you can have a behavior like this.

95
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,640
What he did was typical.

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,280
We can also say, in my typical Saturday, I wake up late and drink a coffee and take a

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
nap.

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Okay, cool.

99
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,160
So it's common, it's regular, it's frequent maybe.

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
That's right.

101
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,880
Or you go out to dinner and your friend is late.

102
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,760
You say, oh, this is so typical of him.

103
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,680
Right, he's always late.

104
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Very good.

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,000
All right, and we have one last set of words here.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,920
And when the guy was giving him instructions, he said, you know what, go left, go right,

107
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
whatever.

108
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,240
And then he said, until you reach the set of traffic lights.

109
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,520
So what is a traffic light?

110
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,360
Well, you know what a light is.

111
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,400
You know what traffic is.

112
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,080
Traffic is cars driving on the road, trucks, things like that.

113
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,840
So traffic light is a special light with three colors, red, yellow, and green.

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,960
And it tells you if you can stop or go.

115
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,440
So they're also called stop lights, right?

116
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
That's right.

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Okay.

118
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,980
So stop lights and traffic lights is the same thing.

119
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,480
Usually they hang from above the street.

120
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,620
Okay, very good.

121
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,620
Words and phrases there.

122
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:11,720
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in just a little bit.

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,200
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

124
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,040
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

125
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
We are not lost.

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm just taking the scenic route.

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,280
Yeah, whatever.

128
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
But would you listen to me?

130
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
No, this is so typical.

131
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Fine.

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,280
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

133
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Excuse me, sir.

134
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Can you tell me how to get to St. Mary's Church?

135
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Sure.

136
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:45,520
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

137
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

138
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Thanks.

139
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,380
See, was that hard?

140
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,760
If you would only listen to me more often, you'd be better off.

141
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:04,200
All right, we've got some great phrases coming up in Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Fluency Builder.

143
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,960
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is what the wife said at the very beginning.

144
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,520
She said, we have been going around in circles for the past hour.

145
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,440
Going around in circles.

146
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,160
So we could say we've been driving in circles.

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,640
In circles means you've been making the same route over and over and over again.

148
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,560
You keep seeing the same house, the same tree, the same house, the same tree.

149
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,080
So this means we're not going anywhere.

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,480
You could also say, Marco, I wish you had brought the map.

151
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,240
We've been walking in circles for two hours.

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
Okay, cool.

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,920
So you can use it if you're driving or if you're walking in any situation like that.

154
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Exactly.

155
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Okay, good.

156
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
All right, so going around in circles.

157
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,440
Now, moving on, the guy was a little bit irritated with her and he said something that's a little

158
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
bit impolite.

159
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
He said, you know what?

160
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm going to ask for directions if it will shut your trap.

161
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
Impolite, this is rude.

162
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,320
Yeah, this is very rude.

163
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,680
So be careful when you use this.

164
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,000
You can say, hey, shut your trap.

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,880
Okay, so shut means to close.

166
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,440
But trap, this is your mouth.

167
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Okay.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
So your mouth is a trap.

169
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
It's kind of like a trap.

170
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,400
In this case, shut your trap is a set phrase and it means shut up.

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Be quiet.

172
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
Stop talking.

173
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,240
So how can we say this in a nicer way?

174
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,840
For example, I've heard people say your yap.

175
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Shut your yap.

176
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah, shut your yapper.

177
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,720
I would say, can you please stop talking or can we have some quiet time now?

178
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Can we have some quiet time?

179
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Yeah, that's a polite way.

180
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
The rude way is shut up.

181
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Shut up.

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah.

183
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Shut your mouth.

184
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
That's very direct though, right?

185
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Very rude.

186
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Yeah, that's right.

187
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay, so shut your trap.

188
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Shut your trap.

189
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
And then the wife said, well, see, there you go.

190
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
We got directions.

191
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,560
We're going to get there now.

192
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,660
And was that hard?

193
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,280
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

194
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,760
So the guy would be better off.

195
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,480
That doesn't really make much sense.

196
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,960
To be better off.

197
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,060
Okay, so you have to think of this as a phrase, not about the individual words.

198
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,800
To be better off means to be happier or in some way better.

199
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
So for example, if I earned more money, I think I'd be better off.

200
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Okay.

201
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,440
Okay, I'd have a nicer life.

202
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,640
To be happier, maybe more successful.

203
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Right.

204
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Right.

205
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,800
If you only listened to me, you would be better off means you would make better decisions.

206
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,520
You would have a better situation.

207
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,200
So I could say, if she got a divorce, she would be better off.

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
That's right.

209
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Her life would improve.

210
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Her life would improve.

211
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
To be better off.

212
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,400
This is a great, great, very useful phrase.

213
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Very useful.

214
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
All right.

215
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,960
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back to talk

216
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,880
a little bit more with you.

217
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,080
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

218
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,160
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

219
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,560
We are not lost.

220
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,280
I'm just taking the scenic route.

221
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,400
Yeah, whatever.

222
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,280
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

223
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,560
But would you listen to me?

224
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
No, this is so typical.

225
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Fine.

226
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,440
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

227
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Excuse me, sir.

228
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,800
Can you tell me how to get to St. Mary's Church?

229
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Sure.

230
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,680
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

231
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,800
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

232
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Thanks.

233
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,560
See, was that hard?

234
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,920
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

235
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,120
All right.

236
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,560
So the whole thing about men asking for directions, why do you think men don't like to ask for

237
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
directions?

238
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,480
Well, it depends on the person, but I think a lot of people don't like to admit that they

239
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,520
don't know.

240
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,760
Because if you ask for directions, it means I don't know where I'm going.

241
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,200
I need help.

242
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
So this is one problem.

243
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,320
The other problem is sometimes directions are bad.

244
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,840
I think so too.

245
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,760
Sometimes when you receive an invitation or instructions on how to get to someone's house,

246
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
they're very ambiguous.

247
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,520
They're like, you know, you pass the dog that's sitting at the corner and you're like, there's

248
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
no dog.

249
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
What?

250
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
How?

251
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Yeah, I know.

252
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,720
I know someone who lives in Costa Rica and her address is go down the main street, take

253
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,160
the second left after the post office and after that, take the right after the general

254
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,960
store and 400 paces is the house.

255
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
So there's no address.

256
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
There's no address.

257
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,640
It's, you know, so these instructions can be very confusing, very vague, like you said.

258
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,680
So I think there's a couple of different problems potentially.

259
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,640
I also heard a joke the other day about a kid asked his mom, he said, Hey, why was Moses

260
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,520
leading everyone through the desert for 40 years?

261
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,240
And she's like, because he refused to ask for directions.

262
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Funny.

263
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I like that.

264
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I was going to say why, because he's going in circles.

265
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
All right.

266
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,520
So if you have any questions about today's lessons or comments, maybe you can tell us,

267
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,760
do you like to ask for directions or do you like to figure things out alone?

268
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,080
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

269
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
All right.

270
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
We'll see you guys there.

271
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Take care.
