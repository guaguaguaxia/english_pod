00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,160
My name is Kathryn and today we've got a monologue.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
We've got one person talking, telling you how to make the perfect sandwich.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
That's right.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,120
She's a chef and she's going to teach us.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,320
She's going to talk about all the ingredients and some tips on how to make a sandwich.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,800
So be prepared.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,340
This is going to be a really good lesson.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,800
And I'm already hungry thinking about it.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,360
So let's listen to the dialogue.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:40,560
We'll be back in a moment.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,840
Welcome to our show.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,320
Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,920
Are you ready?

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Let's get started.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,120
Let's start with the basics.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,160
Bread.

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,400
Bread is an important ingredient here.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,460
You need to remember one thing.

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,220
Use the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,160
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,940
oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,360
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,560
Of course, each person's palate is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,320
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,780
sandwich more refreshing and light.

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,040
The best choices here are evident.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,360
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,540
You can't go wrong with them.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,680
As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,520
with a little touch of olive oil.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,080
sandwich.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,880
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce,

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,480
mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

39
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,260
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,000
all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,380
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,920
how to make the perfect lasagna.

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Till next time!

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Alright, we're back.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
So, obviously, I think she knows what she's talking about.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
This is going to be a great sandwich.

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Alright, so she mentioned a lot of ingredients, a couple of different words that we might

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
not understand.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
So, let's take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Language takeaway.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Okay, so let's go.

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
There's a lot of ingredients in this sandwich.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
You can see the ingredients.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
You can see the ingredients.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
So, let's go ahead and take a look at the ingredients.

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
Alright, so we have the ingredients here.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
We have the bread, we have the butter, we have the onions.

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
We have the tomatoes.

59
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
We have the lettuce.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
We have the tomatoes.

61
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
We have the onions.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
We have the lettuce.

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
We have the tomatoes.

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
We have the onions.

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:56,620
We have some different synonyms that we might not know.

66
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,800
So, we need to go through the synorms that we might not know.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
And she mentioned the word crumb.

68
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Okay, yeah. She said freshness, crumb and color.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
So what does she mean by crumb of the bread?

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Okay, so crumb, a crumb is a very, very, very, very, very small piece of bread.

71
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Like when you put bread in a toaster, maybe it's what falls down actually.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
We call them bread crumbs sometimes.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
You can cook with them.

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,800
But they're basically little pieces of bread that fall off, little grains.

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Okay, yeah. So, yeah, usually it happens all the time.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,800
You're having cookies or you're having some bread, you bite into it and little pieces of bread or cookie fall down.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Those are called crumbs.

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
That's right. And this is a very...

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,800
And I want to remind everyone that the word crumb has a B on the end.

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
C-R-U-M-B. But we don't pronounce the B. We just say crumb.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Yeah, you don't say crumb.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
No.

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Okay, so just crumb.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah, be careful with that one.

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,800
All right. So we have to keep a look out for the crumb of the bread.

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,800
I guess how fresh and how... Sometimes when you squeeze bread, it makes a nice little sound.

87
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Crunch, crunch.

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Exactly.

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,800
But she's also recommending a couple of different ingredients.

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,800
And she said, well, it depends on each person's palate.

91
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,800
So after we've chosen our bread, she talks about a closed sandwich and maybe toasting it.

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Okay, so there are two options for sandwiches.

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
You might see these on menus as well as when you're cooking yourself.

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,800
A closed sandwich means you have two pieces of bread, one on the bottom and one on top.

95
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
It's closed.

96
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Okay.

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
But the opposite is an open sandwich.

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
That means you only have one piece of bread and then maybe you have some meat on top.

99
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Oh, okay. Actually, I always thought that for it to be a sandwich, you had to have two pieces of bread.

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Well, now when you... I would challenge you to look on Google for open-faced sandwich or open sandwich.

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
You'll find some very interesting things.

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Yeah, I've had them.

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Actually, you can put some meat and some cheese just on top of a piece of bread and you're done.

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm a huge fan of those.

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Yeah.

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
So that's a closed sandwich, though, when you have two pieces of bread and the meat in the middle.

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
And after that, she talks a little bit about people's tastes and what people want.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
But she used a very special word.

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
That's right.

110
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
She said each person's palate is different.

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Okay, a palate in the context of food and taste means the way that food flavors affect a person individually.

112
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
That's right.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:36,800
So sometimes you say that some people have very good palate so they can maybe tell the difference between a wine from 1978 and a wine from 1980 or something like that.

114
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's right.

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,800
So you can have a palate, a good palate for wine, but also in this case, we're talking about food.

116
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I could say I have a very sensitive palate so I don't like to use very, very strong flavors.

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay.

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
So the palate is basically your taste.

119
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
It's actually a physical part of your mouth.

120
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,800
It's the top of your mouth where your tongue can touch the top of your mouth.

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
The roof of your mouth, exactly.

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,800
It's not just your ability to taste sweet.

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
It's sweet and salty and sour and all these different flavors.

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Okay.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
So a person's palate.

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Now, herbs, right?

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Now, moving on to the main ingredients.

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You mentioned a lot of easy ones like tomatoes, onions, lettuce, but then we got into a little bit more specific things like, for example, this word that's always mispronounced, herbs.

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Actually, you can say herbs.

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
It's a very British thing to do though.

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Americans and Canadians say herbs.

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It has an H in the front.

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
That's why it's confusing.

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Okay.

135
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:45,800
So we can accept basically if somebody says herbs, but I guess in American English, it's more commonly pronounced as a silent H.

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
That's right, herbs.

137
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Herbs.

138
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
And what are herbs, you might be asking.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Well, herbs can come in many different shapes and sizes.

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
They're usually green.

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
They're usually grown.

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
They're ways of giving food different flavors.

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
And so basil, for example, is an herb.

144
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
It's a big green leaf, something that we use in pesto, for example.

145
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You can also have rosemary or mint.

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
These are all kinds of herbs.

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Okay.

148
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Some people even have an herb garden.

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
That's right.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
They grow their own herbs.

151
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Okay.

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,800
So now moving on to these weird-looking vegetables, for example, aubergines.

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Okay.

154
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Aubergines are the same as eggplants.

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
So you might hear this word sometimes.

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
It's basically a big purple vegetable.

157
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Okay.

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,800
So for those of you who haven't seen an aubergine or an eggplant, yeah, it's a big purple vegetable.

159
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
It kind of looks like a cucumber but a little bit fatter.

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Very fat.

161
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
And if you hold them, they're not very hard.

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
They're kind of soft.

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah.

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,800
And a lot of people like to grill these or to cook with them in, for example, Chinese

165
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
where there's a lot of eggplant or aubergines.

166
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
All right.

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
So we've had those.

168
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
We have mushrooms.

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
And what about asparagus?

170
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Asparagus is actually one of my favorite foods but it's very strange-looking.

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
It's kind of green and it kind of has this little head, right?

172
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
That's right.

173
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
It's long.

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
It's green.

175
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
It's kind of like a pencil.

176
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,800
But at the very top, it's kind of like a plant almost.

177
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Yeah.

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,800
They have a very strong taste and many people don't like asparagus.

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
That's right.

180
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
And the Germans, I think, actually, Germans and the Dutch have special asparagus that's white.

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, really?

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
It's called Spargel.

183
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Oh, wow.

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
But if any of you know what that is, it's basically a white asparagus.

185
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
But asparagus is very popular in a lot of parts of the world.

186
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Okay.

187
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
So now we have our vegetables.

188
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
We have our bread.

189
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
But now we need to add a little bit of extra flavor to the sandwich.

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
So this is where we add some condiments.

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Okay.

192
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
So condiments are a category.

193
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
You can have many different kinds of condiments.

194
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
The most common are salt and pepper.

195
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Okay.

196
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,800
So a condiment is a category of the things that you would add flavor to, as you said, salt, pepper.

197
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
But here they mention, for example, mayonnaise or ketchup.

198
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Oh, and mustard as well.

199
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
These are all condiments.

200
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
So in different parts of the world, they have different kinds of condiments.

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I've seen, for example, a lot of vinegar in Asia.

202
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
You can also have hot pepper flakes like in Europe.

203
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Yeah.

204
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
The condiments that you add to your sandwich are varied.

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I've seen people put all types of condiments in their sandwich.

206
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,800
And, for example, one that may be a little bit strange or maybe a little bit more expensive condiment is caviar.

207
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Okay.

208
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
So caviar is not always considered a condiment.

209
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
It can be, but it can also be eaten alone.

210
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
But it's basically just fish eggs.

211
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
They're little fish eggs.

212
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Very small.

213
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,800
It always usually, in people's mind, it's kind of like a fancy food, very luxurious, very expensive.

214
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Well, it can be very expensive if you get like beluga caviar.

215
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,800
A lot of caviar comes from the Caucasus and Russia and Ukraine, these places.

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
And it's very, very salty in flavor.

217
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
That's right.

218
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,800
So that is also considered a condiment in our case because we're using it for a sandwich, right?

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Okay.

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
So a lot of words there, a lot of interesting things going on in our sandwich.

221
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder where we're going to take a look at some phrases.

222
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Fluency Builder

223
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
All right.

224
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,800
So let's go back to the very beginning of the dialogue when she said, all right, let's start with the basics.

225
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Okay.

226
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
The basics is a set phrase in this context.

227
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,800
We can say this about many different things, but the basics basically refers to the most simple ingredients or the most simple elements.

228
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,800
In this case, bread or meat.

229
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,800
But you can also talk about the basics in other contexts like clothes shopping.

230
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Like when school started when I was a kid, my mom always used to buy me the basics.

231
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
So T-shirts and socks.

232
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Exactly.

233
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
So I guess the basics are the absolute necessary things.

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes.

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Right?

236
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
And also very simple.

237
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:11,800
So for example, if you talk about dancing, the basics would be maybe a certain sequence of steps that important, essential.

238
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
That's right.

239
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
And would caviar be a part of the basics, for example?

240
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
No, no, no.

241
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
No, that's an extra.

242
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Okay.

243
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
So this is what we refer to when we say the basics.

244
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Now our chef, when she continued talking about her sandwich, she said, I would strongly recommend you use fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

245
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Okay, so you can say I would recommend this, but to strongly recommend is to have a very, very strong feeling about something.

246
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
That's right.

247
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
You're saying to the person basically do it.

248
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
You must.

249
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Yeah.

250
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,800
So if maybe your friend is sick, you can say something like, I would strongly recommend you go to the doctor today.

251
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
That means you really, really should go to the doctor.

252
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
I would be upset if you didn't.

253
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
It's kind of formal though.

254
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:07,800
It seems like you would maybe use it with your boss or maybe with a person you don't really know that well, but with your friend you would say, I really think you should go to the doctor.

255
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah.

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,800
But you can say it in both contexts, but yeah, definitely more of a formal thing.

257
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Okay.

258
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,800
So we strongly recommend that you, yeah, okay.

259
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
All right, so now for our last phrase, right?

260
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Where are we?

261
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Last but not least.

262
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Last but not least.

263
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:32,800
So now moving on to our next phrase, when she started talking about the condiment, she said, last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments.

264
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Okay, this is a very, very common phrase.

265
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
It's a set phrase.

266
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
You will hear these words together very often.

267
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Last but not least.

268
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
What could this possibly mean?

269
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
So obviously last means the last step here.

270
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
The last point.

271
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
But why not least?

272
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Well, it's not least important.

273
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Just because it's last, it doesn't mean that it's not important.

274
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Okay, so maybe there are many people who have to give presentations in school and I'm the very, very last person to go.

275
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
The teacher will say, last but not least, Catherine.

276
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
That's right.

277
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Makes me feel better.

278
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Because you're saying you're last, but it doesn't mean you're not important.

279
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Exactly.

280
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:20,800
So when you want to make sure that the last point of your presentation or what you're talking about is not ignored or you just want to make sure that everyone knows that it's also very important,

281
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
you say, last but not least.

282
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Great.

283
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,800
All right, and now last but not least, the end of Fluency Builder.

284
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
We're going to close off with this little phrase.

285
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,800
When she was talking about salt and pepper, she said, a touch of salt and pepper.

286
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Okay, a touch of salt and pepper is basically a measure.

287
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
It's not a lot.

288
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
It's very little amount of salt and pepper.

289
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
So we can say a touch.

290
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
So it's not really a specific quantity though, right?

291
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
We're not saying like a spoon of salt and pepper.

292
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Not at all.

293
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
It basically means a little bit.

294
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
A little bit.

295
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:04,800
So you're just saying, maybe you'll hear this in maybe a cooking show or you'll read it in books when they'll say a pinch of salt or a touch of salt or a dash of salt.

296
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
That's right.

297
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
You could even say it about other things.

298
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:17,800
For example, if my friend just wrote this article and he wanted me to read it, I say, it's a really good article, but it could use a touch of humor.

299
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,800
I think maybe if you made it a little bit funny, it would be better.

300
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Or maybe if you're painting your house, you can say, oh, I think a touch of red paint would look really nice on this wall.

301
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
That's right. A little bit of red paint would be good.

302
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay. So a touch of, a really, really good phrase.

303
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
It makes you sound very natural.

304
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Okay, so that's all the time we have for today.

305
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:50,800
But before we go, let's listen to the dialogue again.

306
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Welcome to our show.

307
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Today, I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

308
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Are you ready?

309
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Let's get started.

310
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Let's start with the basics.

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Bread.

312
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Bread is an important ingredient here.

313
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
You need to remember one thing.

314
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Choose the bread according to the following criteria.

315
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Freshness, crumb, and color.

316
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:21,800
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

317
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

318
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Of course, each person's palate is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

319
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

320
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

321
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
The best choices here are evident.

322
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course, herbs.

323
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
You can't go wrong with them.

324
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:03,800
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

325
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:19,800
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

327
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:28,800
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

328
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,800
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

329
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Till next time!

330
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Alright, so talking about sandwich, this really reminds me of making sandwiches at home.

331
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Grilled cheese sandwich. We didn't really talk about it here, but I think it's my favorite sandwich.

332
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
The grilled cheese sandwich.

333
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
It's very easy to make. Just two pieces of bread and cheese inside.

334
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Do you use butter, though?

335
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Yes.

336
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
So you have to butter the bread, and so when you grill it, it gets really nice and brown.

337
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Actually, I'm not a very big sandwich fan when I'm having, for example, a meal like lunch.

338
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I don't know. I think I need something more solid than just a sandwich at times.

339
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Interesting. I had a sandwich for dinner last night.

340
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Yeah?

341
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I had an egg salad sandwich.

342
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
So you had egg salad inside two pieces of bread.

343
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,800
That's right, but the bread I had was French bread, so that long, thin bread was very crunchy, very delicious.

344
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,800
But actually, I like sandwiches for dinner.

345
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
They are a little bit lighter.

346
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:47,800
When you're having a big meal, it just seems like, although maybe sometimes places give you very big, heavy sandwiches

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,800
that have ham and salami and just a lot of things in there, so they're very, very filling.

348
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
That's very true. Like a meatball sub, for example, is a very heavy sandwich.

349
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
That's right.

350
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,800
But sandwiches come in all shapes and sizes. You can make basically any sandwich that your brain can think of.

351
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,800
And so we hope that you've learned some words for talking about sandwiches today.

352
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Of course, if you have any questions or comments or you want to share with us your very favorite sandwich,

353
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
you should do so on EnglishPod.com.

354
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
All right. We'll see you guys there.

355
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Bye.

356
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Bye.
