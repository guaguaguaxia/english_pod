00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,880
My name is Katrin and today we're talking all about cars in this intermediate level

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
lesson.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
That's right.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,040
We have a little bit of problems with our car and we're going to talk about some possible

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,480
solutions to these car problems we have.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
So why don't we just listen to the dialogue today.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,760
We have no words on vocabulary preview so let's jump right into the dialogue and listen

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,360
for the first time.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,600
Car trouble center, how may I help you?

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,360
My car won't start.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Stupid old car.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
Hold on.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Fine.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Okay.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,840
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Yeah.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,920
Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,480
motor crank?

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,760
Yeah.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,000
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
The engine won't start.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,720
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,760
No.

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,160
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,740
never start.

30
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,720
So what do you think it is?

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,560
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,240
Um, yeah, right.

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
I got the car started.

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,480
Thanks for your help.

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,560
I told you to fill the tank.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay, so this dialogue reminds me a lot of a radio show in America called Car Talk.

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,440
And the hosts of the show, like Marco and I today, they talk about how to solve problems

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,800
and they ask you questions to find out what the problem is.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,640
So it's a really helpful show, but let's take a look at some of the phrases and words that

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,720
you heard so we can understand what exactly is going on here.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Language takeaway.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,680
All right, so today on Language Takeaway, we have five words and they're all very specific

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
to the car.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
So why don't we start with the first word.

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,280
It's a noun and we are talking about the ignition.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,620
Ignition.

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,080
The ignition is a part of the first step to starting a car.

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,660
Basically under the wheel of the car, the steering wheel, there is usually a silver

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,000
hole where you can put the key in.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is the ignition.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,480
It starts the car.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Exactly.

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,100
So you put the key in the ignition and you can start the car.

54
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,120
To start the car means to turn it on, to get it going.

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
That's right.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,600
And so ignition is the first step.

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Starting the ignition.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,200
Okay, so moving on to our next word.

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,960
We have a word that's formed by two different parts.

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,520
A spark plug.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,880
A spark plug.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Spark plug.

63
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,880
So a spark plug is an electrical object.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,120
Basically this has to do with electricity and the way that the car gets energy.

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,720
So it's called a spark plug because it creates a spark, which is a brief burst of current.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,040
So this basically creates a small spark of electricity and this makes the gasoline ignite.

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,480
So that's what makes the car go.

68
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Right.

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,440
So energy is taken from the battery to start a small fire basically, which then starts

70
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
the engine.

71
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Spark plug.

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,020
It's a very small but very important part of a car.

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Very good.

74
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,120
And moving on, we have the starter motor.

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,500
Okay, to be very honest with you, I'm not a car person, so I'm not sure what the starter

76
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
motor is.

77
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,960
So explain this to us, Marco.

78
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Okay.

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,560
So basically your car runs on gasoline.

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,400
So you put your key into the ignition and you turn it.

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,920
This in turn sends energy to this little motor called the starter motor.

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,840
And that basically gets the car going by means of an electrical current before the gasoline

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
ignites.

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,820
So it's like a little electrical motor that makes the spark plug ignite and causes some

85
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,520
of the mechanical parts like the pistons move within the car and then it turns on.

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Okay.

87
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,600
So again, this is all about the beginning of when we turn the key in the ignition, what

88
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,660
happens?

89
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,400
This is a starter motor.

90
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,720
So once we've turned the car on, we've turned the key in the ignition, we have to worry

91
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,440
about giving the car gas.

92
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,040
So we can control gas with the accelerator pedal.

93
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,080
So by saying you want to give the car gas is you want to give it more energy, more power

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,400
or less energy, right?

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Right.

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,400
So if I want to go very fast, I push my foot down on the accelerator and the further down

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,560
it goes, the faster I move.

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Exactly.

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
So that's the accelerator.

100
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,920
Now the opposite of making the car go would make the car stop and those are called?

101
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Brakes.

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Brakes.

103
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,400
So on the left we have a brake pedal and on the right we have an accelerator pedal.

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Very good.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Okay.

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,440
And talking about acceleration and gas, we have a very specific mechanical object and

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
that's called a carburetor.

108
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Okay.

109
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Again, carburetor.

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,120
I know that this is under the hood of my car, but I'm not sure what it does.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's talk about this.

112
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
All right.

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
So it's not very common to have a carburetor anymore in new cars, but basically it's a

114
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,960
small device that controls the flow of gasoline from the gas tank to the engine.

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,880
And basically what it does, it creates, it makes the gasoline into a type of a very thin

116
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,200
mist and that's what cause, and that way, and that way the gasoline can ignite easier.

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,320
So the further down you push your foot on the accelerator, the wider the little gap

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,520
or the hole will open on the carburetor and that way your car will go faster.

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
All right.

120
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Very good.

121
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
So that's all we've got for language takeaway today, but don't go anywhere.

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,320
We'll be back in a second with Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Car trouble center.

124
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
How may I help you?

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,320
My car won't start.

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,280
Stupid old car.

127
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Hold on.

128
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,320
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

129
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Fine.

130
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Okay.

131
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,600
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

132
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Yeah.

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,880
I'm here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

134
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,860
Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter

135
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,600
motor crank?

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Yeah.

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,920
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

138
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
The engine won't start.

139
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

140
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,680
No.

141
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,100
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will

142
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,660
never start.

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,600
So what do you think it is?

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,840
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
Yeah.

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,160
Right.

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
I got the car started.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Thanks for your help.

149
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,600
I told you to fill the tank.

150
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,040
All right, we're back.

151
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,160
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases that we have for you on Fluency Builder.

152
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Fluency Builder.

153
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay, this first phrase.

154
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,320
So you heard the phrase at the beginning, car trouble center, but car trouble center,

155
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,320
that's maybe the name of a fake company that we use.

156
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,320
But the phrase car trouble is very, very common.

157
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,560
So if you say I'm having car trouble or I had some car trouble, what does that mean?

158
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
That means my car broke.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
So you don't say my car broke.

161
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,440
This is one thing that can't break because normally you say I'm having trouble or I'm

162
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,640
having car trouble because a part of my car is not working.

163
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Okay.

164
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,240
So instead of saying I'm having problems with my car or my car broke, you just say I had

165
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,600
car trouble or I'm having car trouble.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
That's right.

167
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,640
So this is a really good excuse for coming to work late.

168
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
You can say, oh, I'm so sorry.

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,600
I was having car trouble this morning.

170
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Right.

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,640
So any type of problems with your car can be considered car trouble.

172
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,040
Flat tire, no battery, etc.

173
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,080
Okay.

174
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
Now moving on, we have a very interesting verb here.

175
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,920
We heard when the guy was talking about the starter motor, he said, do you hear the starter

176
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
motor crank?

177
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
Okay, to crank.

178
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,640
So this is a very interesting verb.

179
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
It can also be a noun.

180
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
It's a sound.

181
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Okay.

182
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
It's a movement.

183
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,760
So when something turns around in a circle, maybe you think of a metal wheel.

184
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
That's a crank.

185
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:47,040
So sometimes we talk about those old cars, you know, 1910s, 1920s, the first Ford cars,

186
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,680
you had to crank them in the front.

187
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,920
You had to actually turn with your hand a wheel to make the car start.

188
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,200
So this is a crank.

189
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Exactly.

190
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
You can hear this in your car.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Maybe if your car doesn't have gasoline, you hear the tick, tick, tick, tick, that's

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
the starter motor cranking.

193
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,040
So it's going around in circles, trying to create energy.

194
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Exactly.

195
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,080
And now when the guy was talking about the accelerator and he was talking about the carburetor,

196
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,020
he said, no, don't step on that pedal because you can flood the carburetor.

197
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,840
So to flood.

198
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,920
Okay.

199
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
To flood.

200
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
This is a verb.

201
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,680
Maybe you've heard the word flood before as a noun, but this means to fill something with

202
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,640
liquid, with gasoline, with water, with milk.

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,320
So to flood something is to fill it up with a liquid.

204
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay.

205
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Very good.

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
So you can flood a dam, for example, right?

207
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
That's right.

208
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,240
Or in this case, you can flood a carburetor, which means it won't work because it's all

209
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
wet.

210
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Okay.

211
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Very good.

212
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,000
And the last phrase that we have very handy when you're talking about cars is to fill

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the tank.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,200
This is always a problem at my house because I hate to fill the tank.

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Really?

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Yeah.

218
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,120
Whenever my car's in the driveway and someone in my family asks if they can borrow it, I

219
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
say, yeah, sure.

220
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,320
And then obviously an hour later, they come back and say, why don't you ever fill the

221
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
tank?

222
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
It's empty.

223
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
You have no gas.

224
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
I say, well, I hate to fill the car with gas.

225
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,360
And so I always have an empty tank.

226
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,120
So I never fill the tank.

227
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Okay.

228
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,760
So that's what it means to fill the tank is to have it full of gasoline.

229
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Right.

230
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,960
To put gasoline into your gasoline tank.

231
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Okay.

232
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Very good.

233
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,000
So we're going to go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time.

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,720
And we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

235
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Car trouble center.

236
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,960
How may I help you?

237
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,680
My car won't start.

238
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,720
Stupid old car.

239
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Hold on.

240
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Before you kick your car, let's go through some possible problems.

241
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Fine.

242
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Okay.

243
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
First of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Yeah.

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.

246
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Those are possible problems.

247
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,960
But tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?

248
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
Yeah.

249
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,400
It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens.

250
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,240
The engine won't start.

251
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Should I maybe press the accelerator?

252
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
No.

253
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,560
If you step on the accelerator pedal, you can flood the carburetor and your car will

254
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,120
never start.

255
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
So what do you think it is?

256
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,120
I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?

257
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah.

258
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,640
Right.

259
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,480
I got the car started.

260
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Thanks for your help.

261
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:40,120
I told you to fill the tank.

262
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
All right, we're back.

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,840
So talking about cars and car trouble, I understand, for example, in some countries, when you're

264
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,320
getting a driver's license, you're forced or obliged to learn a little bit of car mechanics.

265
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,920
You have to learn about the engine or how to change your tire and basic things like

266
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
this.

267
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
That's a brilliant idea.

268
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
In America, you don't have to know how to fix your car.

269
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,840
You have to know how to pay someone to fix your car.

270
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,600
But basically, we only learn the rules of the road.

271
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,560
So the signs and the basic rules.

272
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Really?

273
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Yeah.

274
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,360
But I think it would be very helpful to know how to fix a tire or how to change the oil

275
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
in your car.

276
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,120
I mean, is this a requirement in Ecuador?

277
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Yeah.

278
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Yeah.

279
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,000
When you're getting your driver's permit, your driver's license, you have to take a

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,920
course which shows you the mechanics of the car, first aid course, and also basic road

281
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,320
rules and all that stuff.

282
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,360
But basically, because it can be something very simple, like for example, they show you

283
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,320
where the battery is, where you can check the oil and basic things like this.

284
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,120
So maybe the little cable from the battery just came loose and that's why your car won't

285
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
start.

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
So instead of you waiting for two hours until somebody comes and picks you up or a tow truck,

287
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,640
you can just check very briefly basic things that can maybe go wrong in your car and you

288
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
can just go on your way.

289
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
That's awesome.

290
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I had my dad for that.

291
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,000
My dad said, I'm not going to have a little girl who doesn't know how to change a tire

292
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,760
or who doesn't know how to check the oil level.

293
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,000
But not everybody has a parent who will teach them.

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Right.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And it's very handy because, for example, you get a flat tire and sometimes cars can

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,640
be a little bit tricky.

297
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,840
The wheel nuts are sometimes covered by a plastic cover so you don't know how to take

298
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
it off.

299
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,160
There's a special tool for that.

300
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,200
Or the jack.

301
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,760
Sometimes the jack is not the normal one that you have to pump up and down.

302
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
It's a little one that you have to turn a lever and you have to do this.

303
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,520
So it's very, very useful to know these things.

304
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Absolutely.

305
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm curious to know if our listeners out there have experience with cars and car mechanics

306
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,920
and if you have this rule, like Marco says they have in Ecuador, about learning about

307
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,960
cars before you actually get your driver's license.

308
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,800
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

309
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
We hope to see you there.

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
All right, guys.

311
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:15,920
And remember, congrats to all of our listeners because you are one more person on this Sherwood

312
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,540
line.
