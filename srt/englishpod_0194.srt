00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,400
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about one of our favorite subjects, food.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,600
That's right and on this occasion we are going to talk about Chinese food, specifically

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,560
stir fry.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,860
This is a common dish in America and all over the world thanks to the many Cantonese people

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:28,480
who came over from Hong Kong or southern China and brought these delicious foods to our cities.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,920
So this is a very popular dish you'll be learning more about.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,960
So let's jump right in and listen to today's dialogue and don't be worried if you don't

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
understand everything.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
We'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,840
Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,040
My wife made a stir fry and it was amazing.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,240
I love stir fry.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,160
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce, wilted

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
greens and fresh bean sprouts.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,440
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
Mmm, it's almost lunch time.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
I would die for a plate of stir fry right now.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,360
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,680
I'll take the meat.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,860
The stir fry my wife made was really hearty with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,860
and onion.

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,860
What?

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,360
You call that a stir fry?

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,040
More meat than vegetables?

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,600
It's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,880
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Alright we're back.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,680
So you probably heard a lot of different vegetables and ingredients in this dish.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,440
So why don't we take a look at some of those now in Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,120
Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,360
The first two phrases that we have actually, they're not words, they're phrases, are the

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,280
names of sauces that are very, very important to Chinese food.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
The first one is soy sauce.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,240
Okay, soy sauce.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,080
And it's this black sauce, right?

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Very salty.

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Very salty.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
And it's made from?

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Soy beans.

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Soy beans, okay.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Soy.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,880
So soy is a bean, a vegetable product.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
But soy sauce is a thin, black, salty sauce.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,440
Okay, and it's very, very common to use it with Chinese dishes especially.

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
It's very related.

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,240
You usually have sushi with soy sauce.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,040
Exactly, so Japanese food uses a lot of this too.

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Alright and the other sauce that's not very common in our countries is oyster sauce.

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,560
Okay, an oyster is an animal that lives in the sea.

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,400
It lives in a shell and we often eat oysters as a dish.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:50,760
But oyster sauce is stinky, thick, dark sauce that is very popular in Southeast Asian, so

55
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,160
Vietnamese food as well, and Chinese food.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,080
Okay, so it's part of the ingredients of Chinese food.

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
It's really good.

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
It smells terrible.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
It's stinky.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,040
But when you mix it with food and you cook it, it smells, it adds a very, very good flavor.

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Absolutely.

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,720
Alright, so that's the sauces.

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,440
Now apart from sauces, we have some vegetables and some of those are bean sprouts.

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,320
Bean sprouts are very common vegetables, especially in Asian food.

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,880
So you see a lot of these.

66
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,120
They're usually almost white, almost clear and they're crunchy and they have a little

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
green part at the end.

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,960
Right, so they're like little straws with a little green point at the end.

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,000
So usually those go into your dish at the very end because they cook quickly.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Bean sprouts.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Now if you're cooking stir-fry, what you need is the correct tools and the main tool that

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,960
you need is a wok.

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
That's right.

75
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,560
So a wok is actually a word that we take from, I think, Cantonese.

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
I'm not positive.

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't speak Cantonese.

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
But in English, we normally say frying pan.

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,160
But this is a special Asian frying pan that's very, very large and very thin.

80
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,880
So foods cook quickly in a wok.

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Okay.

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,120
It's not like the other pans where it has a big flat part.

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,320
It's very, very round all over.

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
That's right.

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,600
It's almost like a bowl that sits on your stove and you cook quickly in a wok.

86
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
All right.

87
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
So that's a wok.

88
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Well, the guy compared his stir-fry to a fajita.

89
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,480
Now fajita, that's not Chinese.

90
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
And it's not English.

91
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay.

92
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,520
Well, it is English now.

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,080
It's actually the name of a food from Latin America.

94
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,000
So South America and Mexico and Central America, I think more Mexican than anything.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,080
And it's like slivers of meat, so thin strips of meat and vegetables that you eat in a tortilla

96
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
bread.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Almost.

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,560
A tortilla is like very thin corn or flour pancake.

99
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Yeah.

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
So that's a fajita.

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,560
It's kind of, you've probably seen it, a fajita or maybe what's commonly known as well as

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,040
a burrito, which actually is also an American invention.

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't think that exists in Mexico.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
No, but they are delicious.

105
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,200
I think the word is Tex-Mex, Texas Mexican.

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
So Tex-Mex.

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
All right.

108
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,240
So that's what we have for you on Language Takeaway.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Why don't we go back to our dialogue, listen to it again, and we'll be back shortly.

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,820
Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

111
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,000
My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,960
I love stir-fry, crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster

113
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,400
sauce, wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts, throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,760
It's almost lunchtime.

115
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,320
I would die for a plate of stir-fry right now.

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

117
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
I'll take the meat.

118
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,800
The stir-fry my wife made was really hearty with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
and onion.

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
What?

121
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
You call that a stir-fry?

122
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,960
More meat than vegetables?

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,600
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir-fry.

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,480
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

125
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,040
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.

126
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
All right, we're back.

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,120
So now I think we should take a look at some of those phrases that were used in this dialogue

128
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,360
in Fluency Builder.

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,980
Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,480
The first phrase we have in Fluency Builder is a phrase that you will hear very often

131
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,600
when you watch cooking shows.

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,160
So this is a term we say throw in, to throw in.

133
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Okay, so throw in some vegetables or throw in some onion and garlic.

134
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
And that means to just put it into the pan, put it into the pot.

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,780
That's right, but it's very general or casual or easy.

136
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,240
You just add some.

137
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,920
If you want to be specific, we can say, please add one cup chopped onion.

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
One cup of chopped onion.

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,600
But here, throw in just means add casually.

140
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Okay, add some onion.

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,940
So we throw in all these ingredients and it sounds so delicious that the guy says, I would

142
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,720
die for a plate of stir-fry right about now.

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,800
So that means he wants some stir-fry.

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
I would die for is a good thing.

145
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,640
It's a way to say I really want something.

146
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
It's an exaggeration.

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,120
It's not like you would actually die for it or you are dying to eat it.

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,840
It's just that it's an exaggeration means that you really, really want it.

149
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,600
I would die for a new car.

150
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
My car is old and it never really works.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,760
All right, so you really want a new car.

152
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,480
Okay, and well, the guy obviously didn't really like what he was talking about and how he

153
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,680
cooked this stir-fry and he said, what a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

154
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay, this is a way to say that something is bad.

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,640
It's embarrassing.

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,920
So we can say that this food is a disgrace to Chinese food because Chinese food is one

157
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,800
way but this doesn't even look like Chinese food.

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,120
So a disgrace, a disgrace.

159
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,680
So the word disgrace, it means that something is bad.

160
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,740
Or embarrassing to something else.

161
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,940
So a parent can say you're a disgrace to this family.

162
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,420
That means this family has a good reputation but what you did, what you do, these are bad

163
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
things.

164
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
They make us look bad.

165
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
They are embarrassing.

166
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,500
They are embarrassing to us.

167
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,240
So it's a very strong phrase.

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
This is a disgrace.

169
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,600
Okay, a disgrace, very good.

170
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,320
A strong phrase and you can use it if you ever want to talk about someone or something

171
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
in this way.

172
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,680
But remember, it is pretty strong.

173
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,680
If you say somebody is a disgrace, it's pretty insulting.

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
It's hurtful.

175
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:38,840
Okay, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for one last time and we'll be back.

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,720
Oh man, I had the best supper last night.

177
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
My wife made a stir fry and it was amazing.

178
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,120
I love stir fry.

179
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,840
Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce.

180
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,000
Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger.

182
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,680
Mmm, it's almost lunch time.

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,200
I would die for a plate of stir fry right now.

184
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Well, you can keep the vegetables.

185
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,520
I'll take the meat.

186
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,720
The stir fry my wife made was really hearty with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers

187
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
and onion.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Meat?

189
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
You call that a stir fry?

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
More meat than vegetables?

191
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,440
That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry.

192
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440
What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in.

193
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:34,200
What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap.

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,580
Alright so, talking about Chinese food, there are a lot of American inventions around Chinese

195
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,240
food as well, not only Mexican food.

196
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
For example, it's very popular this dish, chopped suey.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
That's right, chopped suey.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,400
And I think I read somewhere that chopped suey is actually, might have been a Cantonese

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,720
dish that came from all of the leftovers and garbage in the kitchen.

200
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,840
You would just fry it together and it was a cheap, easy meal.

201
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,040
So, chopped suey.

202
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,840
It's kind of like an English, it's like a pigeon English.

203
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,200
And well, this dish is basically that, right?

204
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,240
It's just a lot of meat chunks mixed with some vegetables and you have some chopped

205
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
suey.

206
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Exactly.

207
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,040
And there's also this other thing that's very common.

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
People think about fortune cookies.

209
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,040
You think of Chinese restaurants and Chinese food, you think of fortune cookies.

210
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,280
That's right, but they don't have fortune cookies in China.

211
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
No, they don't.

212
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,160
One of my biggest disappointments.

213
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,280
So fortune cookie is a small cookie with a message inside.

214
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,440
So you have a piece of paper.

215
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,760
Be careful when you're eating these.

216
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,320
You don't want to eat the paper.

217
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,280
But the paper sometimes says very strange things like, you will have a terrific number

218
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
seven.

219
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,360
Right, or something like that.

220
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
So that's why they're fortune cookies.

221
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
They usually talk about your future or what's going to happen.

222
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
Beware of whales.

223
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,840
But that's also an American invention that doesn't exist in China.

224
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,080
It doesn't really come from China, right?

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Exactly.

226
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,600
