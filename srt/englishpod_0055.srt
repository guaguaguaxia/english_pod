00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,720
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,760
And today we're going to be bringing you another great sports lesson.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,680
Yes, this one is for all our hockey fans.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,280
I know we have a lot of listeners from Russia, so this is a very popular sport in Russia,

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Czech Republic.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,920
Yes, and Canada.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
And Canada, right?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,820
Very, very popular in Canada.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,440
It's our national game.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,080
Well, I guess because you guys have so much ice.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,680
I know, there's nothing else to do.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,840
Because skiing and hockey.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,480
All right, so it's going to be a really fun lesson.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,560
We're going to have a lot of great vocabularies.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,400
So before we start in the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,920
Well, we have three words for you now.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
The first one, really simple, puck.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Puck.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Puck.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Puck.

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
P-U-C-K.

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Puck.

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,160
So it's almost like duck, but with a P. And this is actually kind of like the ball that

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,440
you use in hockey.

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
But it's not a ball.

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
But it's not a ball.

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
It's flat.

31
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
It's flat.

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
And round.

33
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
And round.

34
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,720
So it looks like a disc, kind of like a mini frisbee.

35
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,360
And this is what the players do.

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
This is what they...

37
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
They chase this around.

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,440
They chase it, right.

39
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
So in basketball, you have a ball.

40
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
In soccer, you have a ball.

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
In hockey, you have a puck.

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
Okay, our next word.

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Key game.

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,200
A key game.

45
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
A key game.

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
So this word, key.

47
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Important.

48
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,520
It means important, right?

49
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Really important.

50
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Really important.

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Yeah.

52
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,480
So I can say a key game is a really important game.

53
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Exactly.

54
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,800
You could also maybe say a key player.

55
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,320
Key player is a really important player.

56
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
Or even a key goal.

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
A key goal.

58
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Okay.

59
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,840
So let's take a look at our last word now.

60
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Finals.

61
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Finals.

62
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Finals.

63
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
The finals.

64
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
The finals.

65
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
So the finals are the last games.

66
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
That's right.

67
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,520
And the winner of the finals wins the championship.

68
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay.

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
For example, in the World Cup in soccer, there's only one game played in the finals.

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
So after everyone gets eliminated, there's one game where the winner is the champion.

71
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Yes.

72
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Okay.

73
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,800
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue.

74
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,720
And it's going to be a little bit faster than usual.

75
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Because it's a sports commentator, right?

76
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
And it's exciting.

77
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
And there's a lot of action.

78
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,240
So don't worry about it.

79
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Listen to it.

80
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:37,240
And then we'll come back and talk about some of the vocabulary.

81
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:53,960
Hello, everyone.

82
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm Rick Fields.

83
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,040
And here with me is Bob Copeland.

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Howdy folks.

85
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
And welcome to today's game.

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,160
You know, Rick, today's a key game between Russia and Canada.

87
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,320
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

88
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
That's right.

89
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,600
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

90
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,240
The ref is calling the players for the faceoff.

91
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
And here we go.

92
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,720
The Russians win possession and immediately start up their attack.

93
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

94
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,640
Boris Richal has the puck now.

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
And he passes it to center.

96
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
He shoots.

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Wow.

98
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
And it's going to be a goalie.

99
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
All right.

100
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,280
The puck is back in play now.

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,000
Pavel Bory is on a breakaway.

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,480
He is flying down the ice.

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
The defenders can't keep up.

104
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Slapshot.

105
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
He scores.

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,880
What an amazing goal.

107
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
All right.

108
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:46,920
So the Canadians versus the Russians, huh?

109
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,760
It reminds me of a classic, classic game.

110
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Exactly.

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
The classic match.

112
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,020
So, let's take a look at some of the vocabulary that we heard in the dialogue in Language

113
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,860
Takeaway.

114
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,760
Language Takeaway.

115
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,600
We have five phrases in Language Takeaway today.

116
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,580
And the first one is face-off.

117
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Face-off.

118
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
Face-off.

119
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,580
Face-off.

120
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,660
So, Marco, a face-off here is a noun, right?

121
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,340
It's a noun, exactly.

122
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
And it's...

123
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,640
So, in the beginning of a match, the two players will stand face-to-face, right?

124
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,260
That's why it's called kind of a face-off.

125
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,100
And the referee will drop the puck and they'll try to get it.

126
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Exactly.

127
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
So, that's the face-off.

128
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
That's the face-off.

129
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Yeah.

130
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Okay.

131
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Let's take a look at our next word.

132
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Check.

133
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Check.

134
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
To check.

135
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
To check.

136
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,700
So, an interesting verb here, hey?

137
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,220
Yeah, it's really interesting because it's different from the way that you would say

138
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,860
check or revise, right?

139
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Yes.

140
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,180
This is actually kind of a violent move.

141
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Yeah.

142
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
So, what do you do?

143
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,740
So, basically, in hockey, you take your body and you hit another person with it.

144
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
Okay.

145
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,780
So, to check someone is to hit them with your body.

146
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,780
With your body, right.

147
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,740
You can't use your arms or your legs or your hands.

148
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,140
You can only hit them like with your shoulder or your hip.

149
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
Yeah.

150
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
It's called a hip check.

151
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
Okay.

152
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
So, yeah.

153
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
It's very cool.

154
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
All right.

155
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Our next word, goalie.

156
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Goalie.

157
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,140
Goalie.

158
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Goalie.

159
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,180
A goalie is a person.

160
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,180
Right.

161
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,540
Who is probably the bravest of the hockey match.

162
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
No kidding.

163
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,300
So, why don't you tell us what the goalie does?

164
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,060
The goalie prevents the puck from coming in the net.

165
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,220
From going into the goal, right?

166
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
Yeah.

167
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,020
So, the goalie stops the other team from getting a goal.

168
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
A goal.

169
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
Yeah.

170
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,020
Okay.

171
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
So, the goalie prevents the goals.

172
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
All right.

173
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
Very interesting.

174
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,860
Now, our fourth word is related to goalie.

175
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Yes.

176
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Save.

177
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Save.

178
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Save.

179
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
Save.

180
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
That's a noun, right?

181
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
It's a noun here.

182
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
It's a noun here.

183
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,980
So, the goalie makes saves.

184
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
That's right.

185
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,600
When he stops a goal, he makes a save.

186
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Makes a save, right?

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah.

188
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Okay.

189
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,260
We have some examples so we can understand this form of using save.

190
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,900
Yes.

191
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,060
Example one.

192
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,760
That was an unbelievable save.

193
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,840
Example two.

194
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,680
The goalie didn't make the save.

195
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Example three.

196
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
What a save!

197
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
The Russians win!

198
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Yeah, a little bit unusual here that save is a noun instead of a verb, but I think those

199
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,120
examples were helpful.

200
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Mm-hmm.

201
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,520
Now, let's take a look at our last word, breakaway.

202
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Breakaway.

203
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Breakaway.

204
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Breakaway.

205
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,680
Okay, so you have two words there that we know already.

206
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Break.

207
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes.

208
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Right?

209
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
And away.

210
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah.

211
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
So what do these two words together actually mean?

212
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,080
Well, imagine a group of hockey players all fighting to get the puck, right?

213
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,600
And then one player breaks off, breaks out of the group.

214
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Escapes.

215
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
And he skates down the ice and he has the puck.

217
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
And he's far away from the other players.

218
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Right, right.

219
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,600
So he's going away from the other players by himself.

220
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Yeah.

221
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Okay, so breakaway.

222
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Mm-hmm.

223
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
All right.

224
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,720
So we've looked at a lot of hockey language here.

225
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Yep.

226
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,880
And I think it's time now to listen to our dialogue again.

227
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
This time we're going to slow it down a little bit.

228
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:40,240
Yeah, I think this will help you to understand these words a little bit better.

229
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Hello everyone.

230
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

231
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,720
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,320
You know, Rick, today is a key game between Russia and Canada.

233
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,120
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

234
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
That's right.

235
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,480
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

236
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,720
The ref is calling the players for the faceoff.

237
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
And here we go.

238
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,480
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

239
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

240
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Moisei Shad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

241
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
He shoots.

242
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,920
Wow, what a save by the goalie.

243
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
All right.

244
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,880
The puck is back in play now.

245
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Pavel Burei is on a breakaway.

246
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
He is flying down the ice.

247
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,880
The defenders can't keep up.

248
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Slapshot.

249
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
He scores.

250
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,880
What an amazing goal.

251
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,840
OK, this dialogue is interesting because we have commentators narrating or describing

252
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
what's happening.

253
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Yeah.

254
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
In that moment, right?

255
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Yeah.

256
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,280
And they're using some interesting grammar, aren't they?

257
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Exactly.

258
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,320
They are because some actions are happening in that moment.

259
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,360
But we noticed something a little bit strange.

260
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
All right.

261
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
Let's look at it in Grammar Breakdown.

262
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Grammar Breakdown.

263
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,160
OK, let's listen to this sentence that we previously heard in the dialogue.

264
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,680
Moisei Shad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

265
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,680
He shoots.

266
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,120
Moisei Shad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

267
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
He shoots.

268
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,320
I noticed that he's using the present simple, right?

269
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Yeah.

270
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,400
So even though the action is now, it's in present simple.

271
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Yes.

272
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,040
Even though the action is happening in that moment, he's not using the present progressive

273
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,360
or the present continuous.

274
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,560
This is because if you notice, the actions are very, very brief.

275
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
And fast.

276
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
And fast.

277
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
And exciting.

278
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Exactly.

279
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
So you don't really have enough time to say, for example, he is shooting.

280
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
Yes.

281
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Because it's only one quick action.

282
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,720
He shoots the puck very fast.

283
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Right?

284
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,000
Or for example, you wouldn't really say, he is passing.

285
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,120
Yeah, he is passing the puck.

286
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Right.

287
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
It's just one quick action.

288
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
He takes it and passes it.

289
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,360
And the action is finished.

290
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Yes.

291
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,120
I think we can see a few more examples of this.

292
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Let's listen again.

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,000
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

294
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,680
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

295
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,720
Here, we can hear that he is using the present simple again.

296
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,120
Because these are very short actions that finish quickly.

297
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Right?

298
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Exactly.

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,600
And it's actually very, very common when you're describing something you see that's happening

300
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,680
now, that's really exciting.

301
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,560
It's common to use present simple.

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Exactly.

303
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,160
If you pay attention, most sporting events are in the same way.

304
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,000
They would describe the actions that are happening in the present simple.

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Not present progressive.

306
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,200
But Marco, you have an example of some present progressive here, right?

308
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Yes.

309
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,640
Let's listen to this sentence.

310
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,740
He is flying down the ice.

311
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,560
He is flying down the ice.

312
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,640
Now we heard the sentence, he is flying down the ice.

313
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Right?

314
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
Now this one is in progressive.

315
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Yeah.

316
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Why is that?

317
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,240
Well, first of all, when we say he's flying down the ice, it's not that he's literally

318
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
flying.

319
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,680
No, he's not an airplane.

320
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,720
He's just skating really fast.

321
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Right?

322
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,040
So we kind of exaggerate and we say, oh, he's flying down the ice.

323
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,780
But he's actually skating.

324
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,640
So this is a progressive action.

325
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,800
He is doing it.

326
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,320
It's happening for more than one second.

327
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah.

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Exactly.

329
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,760
So that's why we would say, he is flying down the ice instead of he flies down the ice.

330
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Yes.

331
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Right?

332
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
He's skating really, really, really fast.

333
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Yeah.

334
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Okay.

335
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Okay.

336
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,720
So here we see that sometimes in English, we do use present simple to talk about what's

337
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
happening now.

338
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Right?

339
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,080
When it happens really, really quickly or when we want to show that it's really exciting.

340
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Exactly.

341
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Yeah.

342
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,640
Makes it much more exciting if we just use the present simple.

343
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Yeah.

344
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Okay.

345
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,960
Let's listen to this exciting dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk a little

346
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
bit more.

347
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Hello everyone.

348
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:41,480
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

349
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,640
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

350
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,600
You know, Rick, today's a key game between Russia and Canada.

351
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,780
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

352
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
That's right.

353
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,080
Looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

354
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,920
The ref is calling the players for the face off and here we go.

355
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,200
The Russians win possession and immediately start up their attack.

356
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,720
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

357
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
Maurice Richart has the puck now and he passes it to Sender.

358
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
He shoots.

359
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Wow.

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
What a save by the goalie.

361
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,960
All right.

362
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
The puck is back in play now.

363
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,440
Pavel Bure is on a breakaway.

364
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,320
He is flying down the ice.

365
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,040
The defenders can't keep up.

366
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Slap shot.

367
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
He scores.

368
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:27,000
What an amazing goal.

369
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
All right.

370
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,560
So hockey is the Canadian national sport.

371
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,840
Well, actually it isn't the national sport.

372
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Yeah.

373
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
What is it?

374
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Lacrosse.

375
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Yeah.

376
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,000
But anyway, we're not, we don't have a lesson about lacrosse today.

377
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Not yet.

378
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No.

379
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
But actually all Canadians love hockey.

380
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Like we start playing hockey when we're about two years old.

381
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Yeah.

382
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,960
I've heard that some Canadian children learn how to skate before they learn how to walk.

383
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,520
It's totally common.

384
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,400
Well, it is a great sport.

385
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Very, very exciting.

386
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,400
It's very fast paced and it's very aggressive.

387
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
That's what I like about it.

388
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I know.

389
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
Not violent, but very aggressive.

390
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Yeah.

391
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
But you know what?

392
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,040
I must tell you that I am not a good Canadian.

393
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,440
You're not a hockey fan?

394
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
No, I'm not.

395
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Really?

396
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Yeah.

397
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I really, I really hate hockey.

398
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Why?

399
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
You know what?

400
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
It's so small.

401
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,160
It's hard to see where it is on the ice and it's cold and these guys are fighting and

402
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
anyway.

403
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
Have you ever been to a hockey game?

404
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Yeah.

405
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Many times.

406
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,520
And I just find that the puck is really small.

407
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,320
Maybe you just need better seats.

408
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Maybe.

409
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,120
Well, what do you guys think about hockey?

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,080
