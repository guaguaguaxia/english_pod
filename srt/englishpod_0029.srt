00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,120
We're bringing you an advanced lesson today.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
That's right.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,360
An advanced lesson where we talk about investing in emerging markets.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
Right.

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,160
So it's kind of a business topic.

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,880
It's kind of a world topic as well.

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
Yes.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
And it's pretty difficult.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Yeah.

14
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
It is really hard.

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Right.

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
So if you're listening and you don't understand everything, please don't get discouraged.

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,120
Don't worry about it because we're here to learn.

18
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Yes.

19
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
And we're here to help you.

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Right.

21
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,520
So let's get started with this.

22
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm really excited about this lesson.

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Yeah.

24
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Okay.

25
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Well, Marco, maybe you can tell us a little bit.

26
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,480
What is an emerging market?

27
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,040
An emerging market is a market that is starting to develop.

28
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Okay.

29
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
And it's growing rapidly.

30
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,760
So you can maybe give some examples of emerging market.

31
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,240
Well, for example, China is an emerging market.

32
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Yeah.

33
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,200
In the last years, it's been growing rapidly.

34
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,560
More and more people are moving to the middle class and have money to spend.

35
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Right.

36
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Exactly.

37
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
So China is like a really great example of an emerging market.

38
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
All right.

39
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,880
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

40
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,040
Sure, Johnny.

42
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
How much do you need?

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Five bucks?

44
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Come on, Dad.

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
I need $30,000.

46
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,800
I want to get into the market.

47
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,600
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,360
recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

49
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,240
I look at this as an opportunity.

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

51
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
I don't know about that.

52
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,440
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to

53
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
invest.

54
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,840
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,480
how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

57
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,000
There's just too much instability.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

59
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,560
But look at it this way.

60
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,960
Every challenge is an opportunity.

61
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,520
And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

62
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,880
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

63
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
Look at China, for example.

64
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,040
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,880
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating

66
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
opportunity.

67
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,040
Oh, come on, son, you're looking at this too naively.

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

70
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Fine, then.

71
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,520
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

72
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,720
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:49,720
I'm going to hit up mom for the cash.

74
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,320
Well, it sounds like the dad has missed out on a really big investment opportunity, hey?

75
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,440
Yeah, and his son is pretty smart.

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,920
Pretty smart little boy.

77
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, so we have some great words that we want to look at here.

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Why don't we start with the first one, turmoil.

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Turmoil.

80
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Turmoil.

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Turmoil.

82
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,720
So we have some great examples of how turmoil is used in different sentences.

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
So let's listen.

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,320
Example one, with a civil war, a famine, and inflation, the country has been in turmoil

85
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,760
for ten years.

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,160
Example two, there's been a lot of turmoil in my life recently.

87
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,840
I've moved to a new city.

88
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,200
I've changed my job.

89
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,800
I broke up with my girlfriend.

90
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:58,760
Example three, the devaluation of the dollar caused a great deal of turmoil in the markets.

91
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,640
So turmoil is a state of...

92
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,120
Of uncertainty, of change, of difficult times.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
A little bit of chaos.

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,440
So for example, when there's a lot of turmoil in the market, that means stock prices are

96
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,080
changing drastically from day to day.

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
Right, or the economy is in turmoil.

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,760
There's a lot of problems going on.

99
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Yeah, uncertainty.

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Uncertainty.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Okay, good word.

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,040
All right, and we also saw something really interesting in the dialogue about a proposed

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,320
stimulus package.

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,560
A proposed stimulus package.

105
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,360
So a proposed stimulus package is something that's going on now.

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Yes, let's break this phrase down.

107
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,480
So we've got stimulus package.

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,720
A stimulus package, something to stimulate the economy, right?

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,000
Right, so money from the government to get the economy moving.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,480
To get it moving, stimulus package.

111
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Proposed.

112
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,640
It means that it hasn't been approved yet.

113
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Right, it's suggested.

114
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,120
It's suggested, it's an idea.

115
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,640
So the proposed stimulus package for the US economy, for example, is $150 billion.

116
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,480
Right, that's $150 billion of American taxpayers' money that the government wants to pay.

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Put into the economy to keep it moving.

118
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,960
To keep it moving, right.

119
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,480
So if it works or not, that's still a debate, but it's a proposed stimulus package.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,720
Let's move to our third phrase, aggregate demand.

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
Aggregate demand.

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,580
Aggregate demand.

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
Aggregate demand.

124
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,560
So demand is pretty clear, but this word aggregate, what's that about?

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,320
Aggregate is like a combined, added.

126
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Yeah.

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Right?

128
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Yeah.

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Aggregate demand.

130
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,840
So like China, where cities like in Shanghai or cities like Beijing, where more and more

131
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,680
people are accumulating wealth, the aggregate demand is increasing.

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Right, right.

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,920
The combined demand for consumer goods is growing.

134
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Right.

135
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,640
More people have more money, so they're spending more.

136
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Yes.

137
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Okay.

138
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,960
You know, Marco, there's a ton of excellent language in this dialogue, isn't there?

139
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,680
Yeah, a lot of good stuff here.

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Yeah.

141
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,400
So let's listen to the dialogue one more time, but before we do, we have three words for

142
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
you that we want you to listen for.

143
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Yeah.

144
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,160
Pay attention to these words.

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Nest egg.

146
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,800
Nest egg.

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Inevitable.

148
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Inevitable.

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,640
And hit up.

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Hit up.

151
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,960
So from the context of the dialogue, try and see if you can figure out what they mean,

152
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,480
but after listening to it, we'll come back and explain it anyways.

153
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

154
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Sure, Johnny.

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
How much do you need?

156
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Five bucks?

157
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Come on, Dad.

158
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I need $30,000.

159
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,520
I want to get into the market.

160
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,320
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable

161
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,080
recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.

162
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,960
I look at this as an opportunity.

163
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,440
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
I don't know about that.

165
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,200
With all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to

166
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
invest.

167
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,280
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

168
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,600
There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea

169
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,240
how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

170
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,840
There's just too much instability.

171
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,640
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,360
But look at it this way.

173
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,040
Every challenge is an opportunity.

174
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,280
But anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,640
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

176
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,000
Look at China, for example.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,840
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.

178
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,560
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
opportunity.

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
Oh, come on, son.

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
You're looking at this too naively.

182
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,280
devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

184
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Fine, then.

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,520
If that's the way you feel, so be it, but you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

186
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,120
I'm going to hit up mom for the cash.

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,920
So the kid wants to invest because he wants to set up his nest egg.

188
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
That's right.

189
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,360
So basically, he wants to get a bunch of cash together so that he can buy a house or get

190
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,080
married or whatever.

191
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,320
It's that money you need to start your life, right?

192
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
To start your life, your nest egg.

193
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,760
It's kind of a weird way of referring to this money, right?

194
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,360
I guess it is kind of funny.

195
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
And also, the little boy talked about an inevitable recession.

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Yes, inevitable.

197
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Inevitable.

198
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Inevitable basically means unavoidable.

199
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,900
Right.

200
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,600
So this guy thinks that the recession is unavoidable.

201
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
It's going to happen.

202
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, inevitable.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,160
You know, this word inevitable, if you apply the root words, you can get a noun, an adjective,

204
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,600
or an adverb, right?

205
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Right.

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,840
So here are some examples where you can see this word in action.

207
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,160
Example one.

208
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:00,400
Jason knew he was going to get laid off, but he was trying to delay the inevitable.

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,440
Example two.

210
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,140
As a new manager, it's inevitable that you're going to make mistakes.

211
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,360
Example three.

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,600
Inevitably, we all die at the end of our lives.

213
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,520
So as you can see, the noun and adjective form are the same.

214
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Yes, inevitable.

215
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Inevitable.

216
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,480
When we use it as an adverb though, we add the L-Y to it.

217
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Inevitably.

218
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Inevitably.

219
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Yes.

220
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
So yeah, as you can see, we could use it in many different ways depending on what we want

221
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
to say.

222
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Right.

223
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,120
Well, inevitably, we have to move on to our third word.

224
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Hit up.

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
Hit up.

226
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,560
So he says he's going to hit up mom for the cash.

227
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Ask his mom.

228
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah, hit up.

229
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,960
Yeah, this is kind of a slangy term, isn't it?

230
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, it's more informal, a lot more slangy.

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
You wouldn't really use it with your boss, would you?

232
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,760
No, you're not going to go up to your boss and say, hey, I need to hit you up for some

233
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
cash.

234
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
No.

235
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,480
So Marco, I think this word is only applying to money, right?

236
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, you wouldn't go up to your boss and say, oh, I need to hit you up for some vacation

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
time.

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,680
No, it's typically used like for money.

239
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
In this context.

240
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah.

241
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Yeah.

242
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Hit him up.

243
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
We've got some examples of the phrase hit up.

244
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,400
Let's listen.

245
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Example one.

246
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm going to hit up the boss for a raise.

247
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,640
Example two.

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,320
Are you trying to hit me up for money?

249
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Example three.

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,480
I don't have any cash.

251
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,880
Have you tried hitting up Sophie?

252
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
She's rich.

253
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,040
Okay, so this is our first advanced lesson.

254
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,280
I hope you enjoyed it.

255
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,440
It is a lot more challenging, I think.

256
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Yes.

257
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,920
Especially because it's set in a business context, so it makes it... so we have a lot

258
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
of specific words and a lot of technical vocabulary.

259
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
That's right.

260
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Marco, you're exactly right.

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,520
And I think that our users are going to have a lot of questions about the language in this

262
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,920
lesson.

263
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,720
So I'd like to invite you guys to come onto our website at EnglishPod.com.

264
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,080
Basically where you can leave all your questions and comments and we'll be there to answer

265
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
them.

266
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
But until then, it's goodbye.

267
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:36,880
Goodbye.
