00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello everybody and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,140
My name is Catherine and we hope by now you're very excited about football or soccer.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,700
This is the World Cup time of year so this comes every four years actually and we've

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,180
got a lesson all about it.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,180
That's right.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,000
So as everyone may or may not have heard, we are actually in the middle of the World

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,080
Cup and as you say it's a football or soccer competition.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,260
Now soccer is only used in the United States.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,260
That's right.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,160
It's used in the United States although football can be confusing in a place like Australia

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,920
where they have two different games that are called football.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
That's right.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
So it's a little bit difficult at times to tell someone that you play football and they

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,080
think you play American football or Australian football or soccer.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,120
So it's a little bit confusing.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
It can be, yeah.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
All right.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,520
So we have a great lesson all about the World Cup.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,840
We're going to explain a little bit and so let's listen to the dialogue for the very

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:08,080
first time.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
What are you doing?

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,280
What am I doing?

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
What am I doing?

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Don't you know what day it is?

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,240
Um, no.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,000
It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The World Cup.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The first match is today.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
It's Mexico versus South Africa.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,160
It's going to be a really good match.

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,320
Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,880
I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
and all.

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,100
The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,240
This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man.

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,200
Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
trophy.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,400
They first start in a group stage with eight groups, each group having four teams.

42
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,720
The top two teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the semifinals and

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,640
the quarterfinals.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,600
Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Are you kidding?

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Over 700 million people watched the final match of the 2006 World Cup.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,520
It's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,480
Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion.

49
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,320
So far, Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
They're really good.

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,940
All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always

52
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,360
falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,400
It seems like a sissy sport to me.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Whatever.

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm going to go watch the opening match.

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,760
All right, we're back.

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,120
So obviously, two people discussing or fighting over the World Cup and soccer.

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,000
One of them doesn't really like it.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,120
But he came up with some really interesting points and explained a couple of interesting

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
things.

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,360
So let's take a look at some of that vocab on Language Takeaway.

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Language Takeaway.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
So, okay, the very first phrase here is a very important one.

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,420
We're talking about sports.

65
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,720
This game is called a sporting event.

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
That's right.

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,560
So a sporting event is an event, I guess you would say is a performance or something that

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,960
happens occasionally, but related to sports.

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
That's right.

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,160
So an event can be a game itself or a tournament.

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,760
You've heard maybe of well, the UEFA Cup, that's the European Federation of Football

72
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
or whatever it is.

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
So basically, you have this tournament for European soccer teams.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,580
But the World Cup is also an event and a very important game could also be an event.

75
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,920
So this basically means a sporting match or a sporting competition.

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
That's right.

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,340
Now it may sound confusing as to why you put the ing in sport.

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,640
It should be maybe sports event or sport event, but I'm not really sure why we add the gerund

79
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,160
to sporting event.

80
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,840
We always just say it this way.

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
It's a set phrase.

82
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,960
So let's remember that it's sporting event.

83
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,200
This is the world's most important sporting event, for example.

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
Okay, very good.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Now we went and we talked about the first match, Mexico versus South Africa, and they're

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,360
talking about the teams and how they both have a very strong offense.

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,480
Okay, so offense is a part of the team.

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,600
Basically it's a group of players who are trying to score.

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
That's right.

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Okay, so when you're good at offense, it means you're good at scoring.

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,840
And the opposite of offense is what?

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Defense.

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Defense.

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,760
So offense, defense.

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,840
You can say they have a very strong defense.

96
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,800
That means that it's very hard to score against them because their defenders, their goalies,

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,040
they're all very strong.

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
That's right.

99
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,840
So we're talking about an offense and a defense, both very important parts of a team.

100
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,420
And so the guy continued and made a little bit of a prediction saying that South Africa

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,160
will probably dominate the first half.

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,240
Okay, so you know that football matches are split into halves.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,260
You have first half and second half.

104
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,480
To dominate here means to be stronger than someone else.

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,880
So to control the ball or to have possession or to be the one that is the strongest team

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,200
on the field.

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
That's right.

108
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,800
So you can dominate by having a very strong defense or you can dominate by having a very

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,780
strong offense or both.

110
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,640
Dominate means be stronger than.

111
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
That's right.

112
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,620
Okay, now let's move on to the other guy who doesn't really like soccer.

113
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,840
And he says, I have no idea what you're talking about.

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,000
All I know is that I watch the Super Bowl.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Okay, now this is a very American thing, the Super Bowl.

116
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
That's right.

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,440
We mentioned earlier that in America, most people call the game soccer, not football.

118
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Well, that's because in America, we have a different game called football.

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
That's right.

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
And so the Super Bowl is like the most important game in the football world.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,560
It's the game that happens every year at the very end of the season.

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
That's right.

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,400
So this is what we usually call American football.

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,120
So you've probably seen it on TV as well.

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,320
And the Super Bowl is basically the name of the final sporting event of American football.

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,180
Just like we have World Cup, we have the Super Bowl.

127
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,000
And the winner of the Super Bowl is the best team that year.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,240
All right, so now let's go on to explain a little bit about how the World Cup works.

130
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,980
The guy went on to explain that there are 32 countries competing.

131
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:36,000
And basically, we have three parts, an elimination stage, a semifinals, and quarterfinals.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Okay, so basically, this describes the different levels because obviously, 32 teams can't compete

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
for one trophy at first.

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,720
You have to make the numbers smaller.

135
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,560
So 32 becomes 16, becomes 8, becomes 4, becomes 2.

136
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
That's right.

137
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
And so we have different groups for these.

138
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,560
The first one is the elimination stage when some teams lose and they go home.

139
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
That's right.

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,840
And after that, then we have a quarterfinals.

141
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,360
So what is quarterfinals?

142
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,360
The quarterfinals are when you have eight teams that are basically the top eight teams

143
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,920
of the competition.

144
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,580
And they will play against one other opponent.

145
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,680
So the winner passes on to the next stage, which would be the semifinals.

146
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,040
Well, the math makes sense because quarter has to do with four, right?

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,980
So in the quarterfinals, eight teams become four.

148
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,480
And in the semifinals, four teams become two.

149
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
That's right.

150
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
And then what happens after the semifinals?

151
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,840
And then we have the final, where basically the two top teams will compete against each

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,600
other and there will be one champion.

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
USA!

154
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
USA!

155
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,560
And this is when it gets very nationalistic.

156
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,880
People are very proud of their countries.

157
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,480
Of course, of course.

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,840
And so this basically is what happens and how we get our champion.

159
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,040
And well, now let's explain a little bit very quickly about two things that happen in the

160
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,840
game during gameplay when we have a free kick and a penalty kick.

161
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Okay, so a kick, you know, you just kick the ball.

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,280
But sometimes when the ball goes out of bounds or when a player is injured or there's a foul,

163
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,800
then that player or his teammate can take a special kick.

164
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
All right.

165
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,520
And so a free kick is, it's just a kick from anywhere, right?

166
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,760
A free kick is a kick that you get basically according to the referee who says, okay, stop

167
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
the game.

168
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,000
He's going to kick from inside the lines.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's right.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,200
So wherever you are fouled, wherever somebody maybe hit you wrong or something happened

171
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,840
from that position, you will kick freely towards the goal or wherever you want.

172
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,360
You can pass to your other players as well.

173
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
That's right.

174
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,920
But a penalty kick is a bit different because you have to be in a special place when you

175
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
do it.

176
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
That's right.

177
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,400
A penalty kick is when you are fouled inside the box, what they call it, in the area very

178
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,640
close to the goalie.

179
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,880
So if you commit a foul there, then the other player will receive a penalty kick and it

180
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,920
will just be him against the goalie and he must kick the ball.

181
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,840
I think it's approximately 10 meters if I'm not mistaken.

182
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes.

183
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,480
And this is why it's very dangerous because you're so close to the goalie and no one can

184
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
stop you.

185
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,240
And so when fouls happen inside that special box, it's usually bad news for the goalie.

186
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,280
Yeah, of course.

187
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,700
So this is what happens during a penalty kick and well, basically you have no defenders.

188
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,600
So it's just you, the goalie, and it can get, as you said, very complicated for the goalie.

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,320
So all right, so we've taken a look at a lot of things on Language Takeaway.

190
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Let's move on now to three phrases on Fluency Builder.

191
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Fluency Builder.

192
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,680
Okay, so this is a great word to describe how I felt last week when I watched the England

193
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,600
versus America match.

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,840
I thought it was a nerve-wracking game.

195
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
That's right.

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Okay.

197
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
And we heard this in the dialogue, right?

198
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,120
Yeah, you said it was a very nerve-wracking game or in the dialogue the guy said, it's

199
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,380
a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

200
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,200
So if something's nerve-wracking, what does it mean?

201
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
Well basically if you break it down, nerves are those things in your body, in your skin

202
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
that make you feel.

203
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,720
So if someone hurts you, you feel it because of your nerves.

204
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,040
So something that is nerve-wracking makes you nervous.

205
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
It makes you anxious.

206
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,140
It makes you feel very sensitive.

207
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
That's right.

208
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,580
So of course the sporting event is so exciting and you're worried that your country or your

209
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,520
team will lose that you're very nervous and you're very excited, you're very anxious.

210
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,800
A lot of things are going on.

211
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,240
Maybe you're sweating, maybe you're drinking a lot.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,400
You don't want to know.

213
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,080
You don't want to see your team lose and so you get very nervous.

214
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
That's right.

215
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,440
And now of course if your team is in the World Cup, you are cheering on for your team or

216
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
you're cheering them on.

217
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase because maybe you've heard the word to cheer before,

218
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,920
you know, go team, go team.

219
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,580
This is cheering.

220
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,080
But we often say I want to cheer him on.

221
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,560
So this on to me means like I want to cheer him on to victory.

222
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,120
I want to push them towards some goal.

223
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,440
And so you hear this a lot.

224
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,280
Let's cheer them on or he was really cheering me on.

225
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
It made me feel good.

226
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Motivating you.

227
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Motivating you.

228
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
So to cheer someone on, cheer them on.

229
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
All right.

230
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
So obviously this is why we have cheerleaders, right?

231
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Girls that cheer.

232
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,400
Give me an A. Give me a B.

233
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,840
These are the girls or the group of girls that cheer teams on.

234
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Or men too.

235
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I've seen male cheerleaders.

236
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
That's true.

237
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
All right.

238
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,280
And now when we talked about Brazil, they are the team with the most titles under their

239
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
belt.

240
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,160
Okay, we're not talking about a real belt here, are we?

241
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
No.

242
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
No.

243
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,240
Under your belt or under their belt in this case means that in their history, they have

244
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
the most titles.

245
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
That's right.

246
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,880
I think it may come from boxing or one of those sports where you actually wear a belt

247
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,760
that says your title.

248
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,960
And I think, if I'm not mistaken, sometimes a boxing belt will have various titles on

249
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
the belt.

250
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Right.

251
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
The championship belts.

252
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Yeah.

253
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Because they wear it afterwards.

254
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I've never heard that before, but it does make sense.

255
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,640
But the important thing to remember here is that it's not just sports.

256
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,800
You could say he has 10 years of experience in marketing under his belt.

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
That's right.

258
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,680
So that means he's experienced at marketing.

259
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
That's right.

260
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
So that's right.

261
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,600
As you said, you can use it for work experience, you can use it for titles in work, or maybe

262
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,240
in education you can say he's got three master's degrees under his belt.

263
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Wow.

264
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
All right.

265
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,600
So a lot of great stuff there.

266
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,560
We've taken a look at a lot of vocab, so I think we should listen to our dialogue again

267
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,800
and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

268
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:41,840
What are you doing?

269
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,080
What am I doing?

270
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
What am I doing?

271
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't you know what day it is?

272
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,040
Um, no.

273
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off.

274
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
What?

275
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
The World Cup.

276
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
The first match is today.

277
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,840
It's Mexico versus South Africa.

278
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,960
It's going to be a really good match.

279
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players.

280
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,680
I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country

281
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
and all.

282
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

283
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,900
The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.

284
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,040
This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man.

285
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,000
Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
trophy.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,200
They first start in a group stage with eight groups, each group having four teams.

288
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,520
The top two teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the semifinals and

289
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
the quarterfinals.

290
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,400
Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

291
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Are you kidding?

292
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Over 700 million people watched the final match of the 2006 World Cup.

293
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,340
It's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

294
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,280
Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion.

295
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,120
So far, Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt.

296
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
They're really good.

297
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,740
All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always

298
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,160
falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick.

299
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
It seems like a sissy sport to me.

300
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,080
Whatever, I'm going to go watch the opening match.

301
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:19,680
All right, so the World Cup, as we said, it gathers over 100 million people to watch the

302
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
final in 2006.

303
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,680
Now, this sport is not very popular in North America.

304
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,040
It's not totally true because Mexicans really follow football.

305
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
That's right.

306
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,480
But I think in America, in the United States, it is one of the less popular sports.

307
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,320
I was thinking the other day, maybe number five on our list of popular sports.

308
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,080
Maybe because you have American football, the NFL, you have Major League Baseball, you

309
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,240
have the NBA, you have the NHL, and I think maybe before soccer, you probably either have

310
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:00,120
golf or tennis before soccer, even though the United States does have its own Major

311
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
League Soccer.

312
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
Yep, MLS, Major League Soccer.

313
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,240
And my hometown team is Chicago Fire, pretty good team.

314
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,040
I heard they're very good.

315
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,800
And the LA Galaxy, I think, is the other best team in the States.

316
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
That's right.

317
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,880
Now, the United States did host the 1994 World Cup, and I think this is where a little bit

318
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,720
of more interest started to come up.

319
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,560
And I think Major League Soccer was formed prior to the World Cup in the United States.

320
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
That's right.

321
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Well, there's another part of it.

322
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,440
I mean, as young people, as children, we almost all played soccer.

323
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
I played soccer.

324
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,120
I know a lot of my friends did as well.

325
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,960
It's not popular everywhere, but a lot of people play it.

326
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,440
And there's not really an audience for soccer in America once you're in the professional

327
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
realm.

328
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,200
And so the problem is when you pass college, you don't think of it as the NBA, for example,

329
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,760
because there's not as big of an audience.

330
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,200
And so people just end up doing their normal jobs as opposed to being professional soccer

331
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
players.

332
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,640
I think that has a big something to do with it is the fact that there is not as much money

333
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,840
in this sport professionally as, for example, the NBA.

334
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Or prestige.

335
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Exactly.

336
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,480
Although, this is the, on the other hand, these players that do make it and they really

337
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,040
want to play, they go abroad and they go play in the European leagues or something like

338
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
that.

339
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
That's right.

340
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,920
And a lot of the players who were playing the other day against England were playing

341
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,040
against their teammates because so many of the American team, the American national team

342
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,160
play in the English Premier League.

343
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,040
It was really awkward.

344
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,560
Well, it's a really great sport.

345
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,920
I think it's one of the most popular sports in many other countries as well because it's

346
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
so easy.

347
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
All you need is a ball.

348
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
You need a group of people.

349
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,080
You put two rocks and you have a goal and you start playing.

350
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,680
And that's probably why it's the most international sport because it's very easy to set up.

351
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,560
People all over the world love it and hopefully one day the United States will kind of push

352
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
it and...

353
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Become champion.

354
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah.

355
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,160
Well, I hope this year they'll become champions but my fingers are definitely crossed because

356
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
who knows.

357
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
All right.

358
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,200
So, it's a really great topic.

359
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,520
We want to know if your country is in the World Cup.

360
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
Have you ever qualified for a World Cup?

361
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,360
There are still many countries who haven't made it.

362
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,640
Of course, it's a very small pool.

363
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,000
Only 98, 199 countries compete to qualify for the World Cup and only 32 make it.

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,760
And you can also tell us who you're supporting.

365
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
We won't judge.

366
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
That's right.

367
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
So, we're waiting for your comments at EnglishPod.com.

368
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
We'll see everyone there.

369
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Bye.

370
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:38,880
All right, good luck.
