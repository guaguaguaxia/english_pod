00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,260
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,260
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,260
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,920
And today we're going to be talking about a really common situation with parents.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,980
Yeah, when you're a teenager, you always need to ask your parents for money, ask your parents

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,600
for the car, or ask your parents if you can do something.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
Exactly.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,720
And that's what we're going to be looking at is how you can ask for permission for the

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,120
car, for money.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
Right.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,160
And these phrases are not only for your parents, right?

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,920
No, you could use them in your office with your boss or for any situation where you need

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,400
to ask politely.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Yes.

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,960
Okay, so let's take a look at Vocabulary Preview.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520
Vocabulary Preview.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
We have one word for you today.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Concerts.

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Concerts.

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Concerts.

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,360
A concert.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,800
A concert is an event, right?

24
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah.

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Where people play music.

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Right.

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,720
So you have different types of concerts, like a rock concert.

28
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,080
They play rock music.

29
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Or a pop concert.

30
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,280
Yeah, a pop music.

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,640
Or even a classical music concert.

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,920
Exactly, where you have people playing violins and pianos.

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Yeah.

34
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Okay, concert.

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,560
So concerts are always for music.

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Yeah, exactly.

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
They're always for music.

38
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,680
Well, with that, let's go into our dialogue.

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,320
Marco, what happens here?

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,800
Well, basically we have a teenage girl who needs to go to a concert and is asking her

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
dad for something.

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
All right, let's listen.

43
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Hey, daddy.

44
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
You look great today.

45
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I like your tie.

46
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
By the way, I was wondering, can I...

47
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
No.

48
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

49
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Okay, okay.

50
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
What do you want?

51
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Do you think I could borrow the car?

52
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm going to a concert tonight.

53
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Um, I don't think so.

54
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

55
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Ugh, I told you about it last week.

56
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
So you're not going to pick up your mother?

57
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
No, I'm not going to.

58
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm going to a concert.

59
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm going to a concert.

60
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I'm going to a concert.

61
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm going to a concert.

62
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
I'm going to a concert.

63
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm going to a concert.

64
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm going to a concert.

65
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm going to a concert.

66
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm going to a concert.

67
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm going to a concert.

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm going to a concert.

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm going to a concert.

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,700
here. The first one, hottest. Hottest. Hottest. So this is the superlative of hot. Right.

71
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,660
So the hottest guy in school is... The most handsome... Yeah, the most sexy guy in school.

72
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,640
Exactly. So if somebody is hot, they are really attractive. Really good looking. Really good

73
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,620
looking. And so, Marco, is this a word that is only used for men? No, you can also use

74
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,120
it for women. And what about things? You know, recently with Paris Hilton, it's more

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,340
popular with things like, wow, I got a new car. Wow, that's hot. Right. But I guess we

76
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,460
maybe should tell our listeners to be careful with this word. Yeah, you don't really want

77
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:25,140
to tell somebody you're hot. No. It's not very polite. But with your friends, you can

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,920
use this word. Exactly. If I'm talking with my friends and I see a girl like, wow, she's

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,800
hot. Okay. Yeah, but just don't tell her. Yeah, don't go up to her and say, wow, you're

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,200
hot. Okay. Our next word, most popular. Most popular. Most popular. Most popular. Another

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,040
superlative. Exactly. And popular means... Means having a lot of friends. Exactly. Having

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,260
a lot of friends or being well-known. Or well-liked. Well-liked. Yeah. So in every school, there's

83
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,960
always like the most popular guy in school, the most popular girl. Yeah. Were you the

84
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,880
most popular guy? Not really. No, I wasn't the most popular guy, but I wasn't unpopular.

85
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,040
Okay. So that's the opposite. Yeah. So I was okay. All right. Our last phrase, fine then.

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,920
Fine then. Fine then. Fine then. Well, this is a phrase made up of two simple words, but

87
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,640
why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand the meaning of these two words

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:47,000
together? Example one. Fine then. If you won't go with me, I'll go by myself. Example two.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:01,080
Fine then. If you want to break up, I don't care. Example three. You want to go out with

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:09,280
your friends? Fine then. Go. So you would use this when you agree with somebody, but

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
you're not really happy about it. Yeah. It's like saying, I agree, but I'm really angry.

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Right. Maybe sometimes because you don't have a choice. Yeah. Right? Like the girl. Fine

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,920
then. Yeah. Yeah. So even though we have the word fine in there, it's not really a nice

94
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,440
thing to say to someone. No. No, this is definitely not one to use with your boss. Right. Yeah.

95
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,240
Exactly. Okay. Okay. Let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll talk about some more

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:49,000
phrases. Hey daddy, you look great today. I like your tie. By the way, I was wondering,

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,880
can I? No. I haven't even told you what it is yet. Okay. Okay. What do you want? Do you

98
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,360
think I could borrow the car? I'm going to a concert tonight. I don't think so. I need

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,440
the car tonight to pick up your mother. I told you about it last week. Smelly toes is

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:22,040
playing and Eric asked if I would go with him. Who is this Eric guy? Duh. He's like

101
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:32,080
the hottest and most popular guy at school. Come on dad, please. No can do. Sorry. Fine

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:44,600
then. Would you mind giving me 100 bucks? No way. That's so unfair. There's a lot of

103
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,520
phrases in this dialogue that we can use to ask for something. Right. Exactly. And in

104
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,200
a very polite way. Okay. So we're going to look at three ways of asking for something

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,000
and the first way is I was wondering. I was wondering. I was wondering. So I could say

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,120
I was wondering, can I borrow your car? Yeah. Or I was wondering, can I stay at your house?

107
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Okay. It's a very nice way to ask something. Yeah. It's like to begin a question. To begin,

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,280
yeah. All right. Let's take a look at the next one and it's basically the same thing.

109
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,600
Do you think I could? Do you think I could? Do you think I could? Do you think I could?

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Borrow the car? Yeah. Or do you think I could use your computer? I can say I was wondering,

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,160
can I use your computer? Do you think I could use your computer? Yeah. They mean the same.

112
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,120
Right. Now let's look at the last one. Would you mind? Would you mind? Would you mind?

113
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,000
Would you mind? So I could say, would you mind holding this for me? Yep. Or would you

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,120
mind finishing this report for me? Now there's an interesting thing here that you have the

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:06,280
verb in a gerund form, right? Right. The ing form. Exactly. Giving, holding, finishing.

116
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,120
So we've got I was wondering, can I do something? Right. And would you mind doing something?

117
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah. So you have the ing. Be very, very careful. Be sure to not say, would you mind to give

118
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,640
me? Right. That's wrong. Right. That's wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

119
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,840
So you would say, would you mind giving me? Yep. Okay. Let's listen to some more examples

120
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:37,200
of these three phrases. Example one. Would you mind cooking dinner tonight? I'll be home

121
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:52,120
late. Example two. We were wondering if you could buy the tickets for us. Example three.

122
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,600
Do you think you can have those reports finished by today? All right. So I think it's really

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
clear now and it's a very useful way of asking for things. Okay. So let's listen to our dialogue

124
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:12,640
for the third time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more. Hey daddy, you

125
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,840
look great today. I like your tie. By the way, I was wondering, can I? No. I haven't

126
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,280
even told you what it is yet. Okay. Okay. What do you want? Do you think I could borrow

127
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,600
the car? I'm going to a concert tonight. Um, I don't think so. I need the car tonight to

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,560
pick up your mother. I told you about it last week. Smelly toes is playing and Eric asked

129
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,040
if I would go with him. Who is this Eric guy? He's like the hottest and most popular guy

130
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,520
at school. Come on dad, please. No can do. Sorry. Fine then. Would you mind giving me

131
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:59,480
100 bucks? No way. That's so unfair. So Marco, you said that this dialogue really brought

132
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,240
back some memories for you. Yeah, my dad was exactly the same way. I would just say dad

133
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,800
and he would be like, no. So he would always cut me off before I ask anything. Sounds like

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,920
a pretty strict guy. No, but it was a lot of fun. Sometimes he would just say it just

135
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,380
to make me angry or something like that. Like just as a joke. Yeah, exactly. But it was

136
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,160
difficult to get him to lend me the car for example. Really? Oh yeah. I mean he wouldn't

137
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,960
just lend me the car and sometimes if he did lend me the car, then the next day he would

138
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,200
be like, hey, you need to wash the car or something like that. So you had to pay him

139
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,040
back. I had to pay him back with something. In my family, I was always allowed to borrow

140
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,720
the car because we lived really, really far away from the city. So there were no buses

141
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,520
or subway, but I always got to borrow the worst car, you know, the most terrible car.

142
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,040
Which led to so many problems like my car stopping working in the middle of the street,

143
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,000
which was never good. We did used to live a little bit further away from downtown, but

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,600
we had a good bus system. So it would just be like, take the bus, it's cheaper and stuff

145
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,400
like that. So I didn't really get the car that often until I bought my own or until

146
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,700
I had a motorcycle of my own and then problem solved. All right. Well, I want to know from

147
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,600
our listeners, what did they ask for from their parents? Exactly. Did you ask for the

148
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,120
car? Did you ask for money? Or did you ask for a pony? Did you ask for a pony? I had

149
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,800
a friend who had a summer home. Really? So he would ask for the keys to the summer home.

150
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,880
Okay. Well, come to our website, EnglishPod.com. Exactly. Leave your questions and comments.

151
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,000
We want to hear from you. We want to know what you think. And Erica and I are definitely

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,880
there to answer any doubts. All right. Well, guys, thanks for listening and until next

153
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,880
time, bye.
