00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,480
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,440
And today we're bringing you the sequel of I'm Sorry I Love You.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Part two.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Part two.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
That's right.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
I guess a lot of our listeners enjoyed the first part.

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,760
And since it was such a romantic dialogue and hit, we're bringing part two.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,720
So it's even more romantic and I'm sure everyone is going to find some great and useful language

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
in it.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,720
That's right.

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,920
And it's the language that we use to talk about dates.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,240
A date, yeah.

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,080
So useful language for when you're going on a date.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
That's right.

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,800
Well, before we look at this date language, let's listen to the dialogue for the first

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,160
time.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,040
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,840
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,160
I want to make it up to you.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,200
Let me take you out to dinner tonight, my treat.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,720
Oh, that sounds great.

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,440
I'd love to.

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Here's my address.

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Pick me up at eight.

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Perfect.

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:17,560
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,200
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,480
Me too.

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,840
You look so beautiful tonight.

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,200
I wish this night would never end.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
There's something that I have to tell you.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,840
But what is it?

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,040
I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day.

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,640
But I was wrong.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,000
A twist of fate brought us together.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,120
I crashed into your life and you into mine.

40
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:52,360
And this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:00,240
Wow, such a romantic dialogue.

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,400
It really sounds like they're falling in love.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Yeah, it's a really romantic thing that's going on right now, but there were some really

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,000
useful words here, so why don't we take a look at language takeaway?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Language takeaway.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,780
Today we have three words for language takeaway.

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,360
And the first one is relieved.

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Relieved.

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Relieved.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,360
So, we have some great examples on how we use relieved and I'm really sure you can understand

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,320
the meaning from the sentences.

52
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Example one.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:41,680
They were relieved to hear that the company would not be making any layoffs.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
Example two.

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm so relieved to hear your voice.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,400
I was worried something happened to you.

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,520
I guess relieved is like a happy or relaxed feeling that you get if you avoid something

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
bad, right?

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Right.

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm so relieved that didn't happen.

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Yeah.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,480
Now for our second word, pick me up.

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,960
Pick me up.

64
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Pick me up.

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
So when you ask someone to pick you up, you're saying basically...

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come and get me.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,940
Okay, so let's give a couple of examples.

68
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,800
My husband was supposed to pick me up from work yesterday, but he forgot.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Does that really happen?

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yes.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
All right, we'll have a talk with him.

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,720
Or we could also say, oh, I need to hurry up.

73
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,880
The taxi will pick me up at seven.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Yes.

75
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,280
So come and get me.

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Right.

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Pick me up.

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,640
And our final word in today's language takeaway is...

79
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Ordinary.

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Ordinary.

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Ordinary.

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Ordinary.

83
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,640
So, ordinary is a normal word.

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,280
Yes, meaning?

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
It's normal.

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Uh-huh.

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Nothing uncommon about it.

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Yeah.

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,320
So you can have like an ordinary person.

90
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
An ordinary day.

91
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
An ordinary day.

92
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Ordinary life.

93
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Uh-huh.

94
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,100
Nothing exciting about it.

95
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,420
What else is ordinary?

96
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Ordinary podcast.

97
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,640
An ordinary podcast, which English pod is not.

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Is not.

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Okay.

100
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Yeah.

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
So ordinary.

102
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Okay, great words.

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,720
And I guess now we can listen to our dialogue a second time.

104
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,920
This time it'll be a little bit slower, and this will help you to understand the language

105
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:25,560
more clearly.

106
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,440
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

107
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,800
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I want to make it up to you.

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
Let me take you out to dinner tonight.

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
My treat.

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,480
That sounds great.

112
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
I'd love to.

113
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,000
Here is my address.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,320
Pick me up at eight?

115
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,920
Perfect.

116
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,160
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

117
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,520
The food was amazing, and I had a great time.

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
Me too.

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,920
You look so beautiful tonight.

120
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,760
I wish this night would never end.

121
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,680
There's something I have to tell you.

122
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,340
What is it?

123
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,280
I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day, but I was wrong.

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,960
A twist of fate brought us together.

125
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,320
I crashed into your life and you into mine, and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling

126
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,360
in love with you, Veronica.

127
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,640
Okay, so we looked at some great vocabulary, and now we can look at some great phrases,

128
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,400
so let's start with Fluency Builder.

129
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,960
Fluency Builder.

130
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,520
On Fluency Builder today we have three great phrases, so why don't we just start with the

131
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
first one?

132
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,320
Yeah, the first one we heard at the beginning of the dialogue.

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,440
Make it up to you.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,740
Make it up to you.

135
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Make it up to you.

136
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,240
Okay, so we have some great examples on how we use make it up, so let's listen.

137
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Example one.

138
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,320
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday.

139
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,180
How can I make it up to you?

140
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,080
Example two.

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,880
I feel terrible for calling your mother fat.

142
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:28,080
I want to make it up to her, so I got her these flowers.

143
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,600
Example three.

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
John forgot my anniversary again.

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,020
He's going to have to make it up to me.

146
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,000
We can see from the examples that when you use the phrase make it up to you, you're kind

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,840
of saying you want to balance something bad you did with some good action, right?

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,460
Right, so if you call your mother-in-law fat.

149
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,280
You better buy her at least some flowers or a card or something.

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
To make it up, right?

151
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Yeah.

152
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah.

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,560
So the bad action was?

154
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Calling her fat.

155
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
And the balancing good action was the flowers.

156
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Yeah.

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,240
I don't think flowers will be enough though.

158
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
Looks like a doomed marriage.

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,920
Okay, our second phrase.

160
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,120
My treat.

161
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,320
So we use this phrase when we want to say I'll invite you, I'll pay for you.

162
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I'll pay.

163
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,920
Right, so I can say, hey, let's go get some beers.

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
It's my treat.

165
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
Oh, thanks, Marco.

166
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,440
So I'm paying, right?

167
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,960
My treat.

168
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,000
And our last phrase for fluency builder.

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A twist of fate.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,720
So Erica, what is a twist of fate?

171
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,480
A twist of fate is an unplanned event that has a big impact on your future or your life.

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Okay.

173
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,160
Marco, can you give us an example of a twist of fate?

174
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,040
All right, for example.

175
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,920
Okay, you're supposed to catch a flight to another country, all right?

176
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,520
But you're late, so you miss your flight.

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Okay.

178
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,760
And that flight crashes.

179
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Wow.

180
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Right, so that's a twist of fate.

181
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,960
So yeah, it's like fate, it's like destiny.

182
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
You weren't supposed to be on that flight.

183
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
Okay, so a twist of fate.

184
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
A twist of fate.

185
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Great.

186
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:39,240
On a happier note, let's listen to the dialogue a third time.

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken.

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,920
I feel just awful about this whole thing.

189
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I want to make it up to you.

190
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,200
Let me take you out to dinner tonight, my treat.

191
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Oh, that sounds great.

192
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,520
I'd love to.

193
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Here's my address.

194
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Pick me up at eight?

195
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Perfect.

196
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:08,680
Thank you for such a lovely evening.

197
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,560
The food was amazing and I had a great time.

198
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Me too.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,960
You look so beautiful tonight.

200
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,680
I wish this night would never end.

201
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,920
There's something that I have to tell you.

202
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
But what is it?

203
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,360
I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day, but I was wrong.

204
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,120
The twist of fate brought us together.

205
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,760
I crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling

206
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:49,640
in love with you, Veronica.

207
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,200
Okay so we're back.

208
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,160
Erika, I know you have a story of a twist of fate in your life.

209
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Yes.

210
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,000
Recently, actually, this happened.

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,080
I went to this party and at the party there was a contest, like sort of a lottery.

212
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,160
You could buy some tickets and win a prize and the prize was a week-long vacation.

213
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
So I went with some friends of mine and they were tired so they left early and they gave

214
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
me their tickets.

215
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,880
And guess what happened?

216
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
What happened?

217
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
We won.

218
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,360
We won the week-long vacation.

219
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Wow.

220
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Yeah, it was amazing.

221
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,560
So that was a really lucky twist of fate for me.

222
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
A lucky twist of fate.

223
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
That's a good story.

224
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Yeah.

225
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
I'm sure it wasn't that good of a twist of fate for your friends.

226
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, but they were very generous and let me have the prize anyway.

227
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
All right.

228
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,080
Well, we want to hear your stories of maybe some type of twist of fate that you've had.

229
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Yes.

230
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Maybe love stories, maybe tragic stories, any story.

231
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,000

233
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,480
Yes, that's right.

234
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:28,400
So I guess until then, it's goodbye.
