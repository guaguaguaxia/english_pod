00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Kathryn.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,760
And Marco, I can tell you right now, I'm already hungry just thinking about our lesson today.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
That's right.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,640
Today we have another food lesson.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,040
Our world cuisine lesson for today is all about Mexican food.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Okay.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Mexican food comes from the country Mexico, but also parts of the United States like Texas

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,480
have something called Tex-Mex.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,840
So you're going to hear a lot about these kinds of foods there.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,400
Let's check out today's dialogue.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Hello, sir.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,360
Welcome to Pistolero Restaurant.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,920
May I take your order?

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,520
Yes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,080
Sorry sir, but we ran out of chicken.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,560
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,760
Sure, I'll have the burrito.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Do you have nachos?

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,120
Of course, sir.

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,080
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Sounds good.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
Would you like anything to drink?

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,920
Sure, I'll have a Corona.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,120
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,360
So a lot of great dishes from Mexico.

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,240
Let's take a closer look at some of those on Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,000
Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,540
So first up, Marco, we have the word enchilada.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,540
That's right.

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,040
We have some chicken cheese enchiladas.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,920
So this dish has chicken and cheese, but an enchilada, what is that?

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,520
Okay, so it's basically a wrap that is covered in cheese, right?

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
That's right.

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,760
So it has a base of a flour tortilla.

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,960
So a tortilla is like a wrap, as you said.

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,760
Let's consider it as flat bread.

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Very thin.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Very thin.

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,280
And it rolls up and it's covered with cheese and inside it has chicken.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Very, very good.

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
That's right.

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,240
So this is the beginning, you're going to hear me say the American pronunciation, enchilada,

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,800
and you're going to hear Marco say a more appropriate.

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,640
A little bit with a more Hispanic accent to it.

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
That's right.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
So the second one we've got is guacamole.

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Guacamole.

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
That's right.

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,560
We say guacamole and this is from the avocado fruit.

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
That's right.

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Avocados are green fruits.

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
They have a skin.

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,080
So you take the skin off and you usually mix guacamole with other ingredients.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Right.

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,880
A little bit of lemon, onion, tomato.

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000
Maybe a little spice.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,540
Really good stuff.

61
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,960
So yeah, it comes from that fruit that you said and it's kind of like a paste, right?

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,160
Yeah, it's something that we often use as a dip.

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
So I can dip my potato chips or my tortilla chips in it or I can use it as a sauce.

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
All right.

65
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Very good.

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,360
And our next and probably one of the most popular dishes in the Mexican cuisine world

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,160
is a beef burrito.

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Burrito.

69
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,600
So a burrito is another kind of wrap.

70
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,880
We have a tortilla like you said earlier and inside there are many different things.

71
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,440
So usually some rice and some beans and some meat, maybe beef or chicken.

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
That's right.

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,120
So consider it kind of like a sandwich more or less.

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,240
But in a blanket instead of in bread.

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Exactly.

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
In a blanket.

77
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,560
And then also we have cheese quesadillas.

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,600
Now also these are made from the same blanket of tortilla.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
That's right.

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,800
So this thin tortilla, this flour tortilla is put on top and on bottom and inside you

81
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,000
have some cheese, some melted cheese or other times you can have cheese and chicken.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,480
And usually you find it's a circle but it's cut into four pieces.

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,560
So it looks like pieces of a pie.

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
That's right.

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,840
And what you do is you heat it up in a pan so the cheese inside melts and it's very,

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
very delicious.

87
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
It is.

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
And sometimes you have this with a side of jalapeno.

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Okay.

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
This is some type of vegetable I would guess.

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
It's a pepper.

92
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
It's a pepper.

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Right.

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,320
So this is a very, very spicy pepper that people often use to make things taste hot.

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
That's right.

96
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
So you can see them.

97
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,760
They're usually green and they're very, very spicy.

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,800
So if you bite into one, it'll burn your mouth.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
It will.

100
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,520
And sometimes people like to put these on our next dish.

101
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,680
What's the next dish, Marco?

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
We have some nachos.

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Okay.

104
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,280
This is a classic Tex-Mex dish like I was saying.

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,760
So a lot of Americans love to eat this.

106
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,480
And nachos are basically a plate of tortilla chips with what on top?

107
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,960
Usually it has melted cheese and maybe some chili like we see in the dialogue.

108
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,120
So it will kind of just consider a plate full of these chips.

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,440
They look like potato chips, but they're made out of flour.

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,240
And on top a lot of cheese and maybe some meat or some chili on top.

111
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,880
And Americans also like to put sour cream on top.

112
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Oh, yes.

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,100
Sour cream is very popular on this dish.

114
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,160
So a lot of dishes, these are probably the most popular ones that you can find at most

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Mexican restaurants and also in Tex-Mex style cuisine.

116
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,040
So why don't we take another look at everything and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

117
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,440
Hello, sir.

118
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,000
Welcome to Pistolero Restaurant.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
May I take your order?

120
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,840
Yes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

121
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,680
Sorry, sir, but we ran out of chicken.

122
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,400
Sure, I'll have the burrito.

125
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Do you have nachos?

126
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,760
Of course, sir.

127
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,720
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

128
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Sounds good.

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,280
Would you like anything to drink?

130
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,880
Sure, I'll have a Corona.

131
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,800
All right, so Marco, today we have only three things to talk about in Fluency Builder.

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,760
The first one is something that the waiter said to the customer.

133
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,960
It was to run out of.

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
That's right.

135
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,700
He wanted some chicken cheese enchiladas, but unfortunately they ran out of chicken.

136
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,560
So the phrasal verb here is to run out of.

137
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
That's right, and we heard the past tense.

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,720
So unfortunately, we ran out of chicken.

139
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,360
This means that we no longer have chicken.

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
We sold all of the chicken.

141
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
That's right.

142
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,960
So for example, if you're in your car and all of a sudden you run out of gasoline, it

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,800
means your car will stop running.

144
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
That's very bad situation.

145
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,160
So to run out of means to not have any more.

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
That's right.

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,440
So you ran out of money.

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Maybe you have no more money.

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,640
That's another bad situation.

150
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,920
So instead he ordered a burrito that included a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

151
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,400
Okay, so the reason we included this is because it's important to remember this as a phrase,

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
a side of.

153
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
That's right.

154
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,640
So this burrito comes with a side of guacamole or this burrito has a side of beans.

155
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,640
So a side of means a small portion, a little bit.

156
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
That's right.

157
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,760
So the important part of a side of is that it doesn't come in the dish or inside the

158
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
burrito let's say.

159
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,880
It just comes separately on a separate little plate.

160
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
Or it can come next to the main dish.

161
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:23,560
So if the main dish is tacos, you can say I want tacos with a side of black beans.

162
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
You would get the black beans in a little bowl next to you.

163
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
But that's not the main thing.

164
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Exactly, exactly.

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,480
So a side of.

166
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Now for our last phrase, when we talked about the nachos, they came with melted cheese and

167
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
chili.

168
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,080
So what do we mean by they come with melted cheese and chili?

169
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,360
Okay, so this verb to come with means that they have as a part of the dish.

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,920
So this is not a side.

171
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,280
Not like before when we were talking about a side of.

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,760
This means that in the case of nachos, the nachos have on them, on top, cheese and chili.

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
That's right.

174
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,720
So sometimes if you go to McDonald's and you buy a meal, you get a burger and the burger

175
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
comes with French fries and a Coke included in the meal.

176
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,000
Or you can say, unfortunately, this meal does not come with a drink.

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
So you have to order the drink extra.

178
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
That's right.

179
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,380
Okay, so a lot of great stuff.

180
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,280
Let's take another look and we'll be right back.

181
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:30,920
Hello, sir, welcome to Pistolero restaurant, may I take your order?

182
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,160
Yes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

183
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,080
Sorry, sir, but we ran out of chicken.

184
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,760
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

185
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,400
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Sure, I'll have the burrito.

187
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,080
Do you have nachos?

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
Of course, sir.

189
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

190
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Sounds good.

191
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,640
Would you like anything to drink?

192
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,240
Sure, I'll have a Corona.

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,840
All right, so Mexican food, very, very delicious.

194
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,120
And as we see, it has a lot of cheese in most dishes.

195
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,880
It does, a lot of cheese and also a lot of tortillas.

196
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,760
So tortillas are these usually round, flat, pancake like things.

197
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
They're not sweet, they're savory.

198
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,200
And you usually put things in them like tacos or fajitas or burritos.

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
That's right.

200
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
And there's two kinds, right?

201
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
That's right.

202
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,400
So you have tortillas that are made from flour that are usually white.

203
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,280
And then you have corn tortillas that are made from corn and they're usually a little

204
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,760
bit more yellow.

205
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
That's right.

206
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,080
So it's actually, Mexican food is very, very good, but usually it's a little bit spicy.

207
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,640
So if you don't really like a spicy food, you should tell the waiter or waitress to

208
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,880
not make it spicy.

209
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
That's right.

210
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,400
If you don't eat spicy food, you certainly don't want to eat any jalapeno peppers.

211
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
That's right.

212
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm actually not really a fan of spicy food.

213
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
So for example, I really cannot eat jalapeno peppers.

214
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
See, I'm the opposite.

215
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
I love spicy food.

216
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,280
So I often order green enchiladas, which have a spicy jalapeno green sauce.

217
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah, they're very, very spicy.

218
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,960
So this is part of our mini series that we have all about world foods.

219
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
We've already taken a look at Italian food.

220
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
We have Mexican food.

221
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,360
Next we'll be looking at Indian food, Korean food, a lot of great international foods coming

223
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Yummy.

224
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
So let us know, do you like Mexican food?

225

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,200
And if we left off some kind of Mexican food like tacos, let us know.

227
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
That's right.
