00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,800
And my name is Katrin and today we are talking about an important holiday the world over.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,000
It's very important all over the world, especially in the United States.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,880
So let's take a look at this holiday in Vocabulary Preview.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
Vocabulary Preview.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
So the name of the holiday is Veterans Day.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
So veteran.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,560
So what's a veteran?

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,400
A veteran is a person who has participated in a war or in some kind of military situation.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Okay.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,200
So Veterans Day is a day where you commemorate all the people that fought in the different

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
wars.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Exactly.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,240
A veteran doesn't have to be a World War II veteran.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,840
They could be a Civil War veteran or a Vietnam War veteran.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
Just a general term.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Or a Gulf War.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Exactly.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,920
So that's the day in the United States where everyone honors all the soldiers that participated

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,840
in different wars and they fought for their country.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Alright.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,840
So why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
You mean Amistiz Day?

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,720
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,560
November 11th is Veterans Day.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,280
What planet are you from?

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,240
Well, as you know, on November 11th the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,160
known as the Amistiz Treaty.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,720
This marked the end of World War I and many countries around the world commemorated this

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,880
date under names such as Remembrance Day.

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,320
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,400
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Wow.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,040
I didn't know.

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:55,720
Probably because I flunked history in school.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,360
Alright so there's a lot of really great vocabulary in this elementary lesson.

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,440
So let's take a look at some of these words and phrases in Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,880
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,920
Alright so the first word that came up after the guy mentioned Veterans Day, the girl mentioned

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,640
Armistice Day.

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Armistice.

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Okay.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
So what is this Armistice Day?

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,120
Armistice means to stop fighting, right?

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,160
So it's a time in which people lay down their arms, we say.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,600
And it's one that's celebrated in Commonwealth countries like England or Canada and in parts

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
of Europe.

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,680
Okay, very good.

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,000
So Armistice Day, kind of like the equivalent for Commonwealth countries to Veterans Day.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright and well the girl gave him a bit of a history lesson and mentioned that on November

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,760
11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty.

54
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,840
So we have two great words here.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Allies.

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,240
So Allies is a word that we use in English to indicate people who fought against the

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,800
Germans, Italians and Japanese in World War II.

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,920
So Allies include Great Britain, America, France for some time.

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,040
So these are countries that were, and Russia, they were fighting against the Germans.

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Right.

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,160
So in general terms, an ally is a friend, right?

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Exactly.

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
So Marco and I are allies.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,120
If there's a fight, I'm on his side.

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
The opposite of enemies.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Exactly.

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Very good.

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,960
And well the Allies signed a peace treaty.

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
So what is a peace treaty?

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,200
A treaty is a document that outlines new rules for a situation.

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,440
And a peace treaty is a document that calls for peace.

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,040
It says we will not fight anymore.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,040
We will have peace and this is what this means.

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
So we have new rules.

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
So it's an agreement.

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
It's like a contract.

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Exactly.

78
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
It's a contract between nations.

79
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay, very good.

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,160
Alright and as we mentioned, Veterans Day or Armistice Day, we commemorate these events

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,360
that happened in the past.

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,080
So to commemorate something.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Right.

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,800
So in a sense, we are honoring it.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,200
So to commemorate is to remember, to honor, to...

86
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Remember with respect.

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
So yeah, to remember with respect.

88
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Exactly.

89
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,200
There's a positive, respectful tone here.

90
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,760
It's remembering for a good reason.

91
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
Okay, very good.

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,120
So we've taken a look at these four words.

93
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,720
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit to look at Fluency

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Builder.

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,640
You mean Armistice Day?

97
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
What are you talking about?

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,600
November 11th is Veterans Day.

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,360
What planet are you from?

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,240
Well, as you know, on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also

101
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,160
known as the Armistice Treaty.

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,720
This marked the end of World War I and many countries around the world commemorated this

103
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,200
date under names such as Remembrance Day.

104
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,320
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,480
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,040
Wow, I didn't know.

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,960
Probably because I flunked history in school.

108
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,600
Today's Fluency Builder includes a couple of really interesting phrases that are kind

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
of longer.

110
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,080
So, let's take a look at the first one, which is very, very common in English.

111
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
All right.

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,080
So, this first sentence was kind of using a sarcastic tone because he said, what are

113
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,240
you talking about?

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Right.

115
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
So, this guy says, Veterans Day?

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh, you mean Armistice Day?

117
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
What are you talking about?

118
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,760
That means, no, I mean Veterans Day.

119
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Right.

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,920
So, he wasn't really asking like, what are you talking about?

121
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,920
He was literally saying with this sentence, are you crazy?

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
You're wrong.

123
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
You're wrong.

124
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,200
So, what are you talking about is a way, very sarcastic way to say, listen, I think you're

125
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,160
wrong or you must be a little bit crazy.

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Right.

127
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
What are you talking about?

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
All right.

129
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,640
And then, to end the whole sarcastic sentence there, he said, what planet are you from?

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,480
So, obviously, this is Veterans Day.

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,040
What planet are you from?

132
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
So, you're so wrong.

133
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,240
How do you not understand what this is?

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
How do you not know this?

135
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Right.

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,040
And so, for example, I could say, maybe I'll ask you, Marco, who's the President of the

137
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
United States?

138
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
All right.

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
I can say, well, what planet are you from?

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
It's obviously President Obama.

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh, duh.

142
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,320
So, it's like, obviously, everybody knows this.

143
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Right.

144
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,760
So, you're saying, how do you not know this already?

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,160
So, it's very sarcastic.

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,980
What planet are you from?

147
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,160
And finally, the guy is talking about how he doesn't understand what the meaning of

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Veterans Day is.

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,200
And after this long explanation, he says, well, I didn't know, probably because I flunked

150
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
history in school.

151
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Right.

152
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,000
So, if you flunked history or you flunked any subject in school, it means you didn't

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
pass.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Exactly.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,640
So, flunk, to flunk is a verb in English and it means to fail a subject.

156
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,960
It means maybe in 100% is perfect, you got 50% or 40% and you have to take the course

157
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
again.

158
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Okay.

159
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,080
Did you ever flunk an exam in school?

160
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
No.

161
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
No, really?

162
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
You didn't?

163
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Never?

164
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
No.

165
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Wow.

166
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Such a good student.

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Did you?

168
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Maybe.

169
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I did maybe once or twice.

170
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I was much too self-critical.

171
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,200
All right.

172
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

173
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

174
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
You mean Armistice Day?

175
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,480
What are you talking about?

176
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,320
November 11th is Veterans Day.

177
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,000
What planet are you from?

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,960
Well, as you know, on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also

179
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,880
known as the Armistice Treaty.

180
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,440
This marked the end of World War I and many countries around the world commemorated this

181
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,920
date under names such as Remembrance Day.

182
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,040
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

183
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,240
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Wow.

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,760
I didn't know.

186
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,520
Probably because I flunked history in school.

187
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:14,280
All right.

188
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,120
So Veterans Day, it's a big deal in the United States, right?

189
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
It's a very big deal.

190
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
There's a parade.

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Yeah, in most cities in the country, there are parades.

192
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,280
And when I was in school, we had to play music because I was in band.

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,680
We used to play music for the veterans and we'd go to the cemetery and play taps.

194
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,680
No, we didn't play taps.

195
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
It was...

196
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
That's like the funeral song.

197
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,760
Yeah, we would play funeral songs and taps for the local veterans who will be respecting

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,600
and commemorating fallen soldiers.

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Wow.

200
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,720
And then talks as well, like on national TV and stuff.

201
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
That's right.

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
All right.

203
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,040
So it's very interesting, especially the history lesson, the fact that on November, I think

204
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,120
it's called 11-11-11, right?

205
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,640
November 11th at 11 o'clock, they signed this armistice treaty.

206
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
And that was in 1918.

207
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,320
So this is World War I.

208
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,680
We're talking about when the world had never really seen fighting like this before.

209
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,320
And so everyone was just relieved when what they called the Great War was finally over.

210
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
It's a very interesting history lesson.

211
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,240
So I'm sure many people have some opinions on this.

212
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,280
So we would be glad to hear it from you on our website at EnglishPod.com.

213
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,240
You can also leave questions or comments and we'll see you guys there.

214
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,200
And let us know, do you celebrate this holiday in your country?

215
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Yep.

216
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
All right.

217
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Until next time.

218
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Thanks for watching.
