00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,120
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
And today we are going back in time.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,360
That's right, we're visiting the 1950s.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,880
Alright so we are going to the year 1950 and well, we are going to look at some of the

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,800
typical and common words and phrases that were used back in that year.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,480
Yes, all of these words and phrases you might still hear today but they are really a little

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,480
bit old-fashioned.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,520
Alright, so we have some words that we need to look at before we listen to our dialogue.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,240
So let's look at these words in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,840
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,140
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,840
The first one, sock hop.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Sock hop.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
A sock hop.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,560
Okay, now this is very old-fashioned and probably not used anymore.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,320
No, not used anymore.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,800
But a sock hop is a school dance.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,440
Okay so all the kids after school would get together and dance rock and roll in the gym

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,840
or something.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,200
And well, it's very popular and very common among American culture in those days.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,800
Yes, in 1950.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,240
So you would still maybe see this in a movie or something like that.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,520
And our second word is still used today.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
Sadie Hawkins dance.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,320
A Sadie Hawkins dance.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,640
Alright, a Sadie Hawkins dance.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,720
So a Sadie Hawkins dance is a dance when the girls ask the guys to be their date.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,600
Okay, so it's a party and the guys don't invite the girls.

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
No, the girls invite the guys.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,320
Okay, so it's a little bit of a reverse of roles there.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Yes.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
That's interesting.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,280
So in this case, the girls have to come up to the guys and say, hey, do you want to go

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,080
to the dance with me?

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Very good.

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,800
Well, this still happens today in North America, so you will probably hear it sometime.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,240
And I guess now we could listen to a dialogue for the first time.

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,560
And it takes place at a high school.

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,760
Hey, Tracy, how are you doing?

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm swell, Sandy.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Hey, listen, you want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
It'll be a blast.

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
The girls got to ask the guys.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,720
Also, all right.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,400
So when are you going to ask me?

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,920
I've had my eye on you for a while.

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,120
Hey, buddy, ease off my girl, man.

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,160
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,520
Cool it, guys.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,960
Your girl says who says me, pipsqueak.

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:47,120
All right, so a little bit of a discussion over a girl.

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Very common.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Yep.

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,040
So we're going to be looking at some of these words that were maybe a little bit difficult

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,960
in the dialogue in Language Takeaway.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Language Takeaway.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,200
Well, we've got five phrases and words from the dialogue.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,320
Now, the first thing we heard was Sandy said, heya.

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Heya.

64
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Heya.

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
All right.

66
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Now, an interjection, a way of saying hi, but very old-fashioned.

67
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Heya.

68
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Yep.

69
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Basically, hi, you.

70
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Or hey, you.

71
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Yep.

72
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Okay.

73
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
So heya.

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
I guess you would still use it today, though, right?

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
Yeah, it's still a normal way to greet someone.

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
All right.

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Very friendly.

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Okay.

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
And what about our second word?

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, Sandy asks Tracy, how are you?

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,280
And Tracy replies, I'm swell.

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm swell.

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Swell.

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,640
I'm just swell.

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,880
When you are swell, you are great.

86
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
You're great.

87
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,720
And again, swell is an old-fashioned way of saying I'm good or I'm great, but you would

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
still hear it.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Yes.

90
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,320
And swell also is used to describe things.

91
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,840
That was a swell party.

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Okay.

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Swell.

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Yep.

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
All right.

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,400
Now, for our next word, they got into a fight and Tracy said, cool it, guys.

97
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Cool it.

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Cool it.

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Cool it.

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,760
So, why don't we listen to some examples of cool it before we explain it.

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,240
Example one.

102
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Just cool it.

103
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,000
Now is not the right time to get angry.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,560
Example two.

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,880
You need to cool it and stop yelling at me.

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,960
Example three.

107
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,160
Don't cry, Pam.

108
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Just cool it.

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
You will be okay.

110
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
All right.

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
So, cool it, guys.

112
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Basically, it means...

113
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Relax.

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Take it easy.

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Yeah.

116
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Don't get into a fight.

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
Don't get into a fight.

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Okay.

119
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,720
This is one my dad used to say to me and my sisters all the time.

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Cool it, kids.

121
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Stop fighting.

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Very good.

123
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
So, it is still very commonly used, I would say.

124
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Yep.

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
All right.

126
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,040
Now, for our last two words, these are a little bit more old-fashioned.

127
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes.

128
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,160
Straight from 1952.

129
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,360
They talk about a knuckle sandwich.

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
All right.

131
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,320
He says, do you want a knuckle sandwich?

132
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
A knuckle sandwich.

133
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
What are we talking about here?

134
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
All right.

135
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,640
So, on your hand, you have...

136
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Above your fingers, you have your knuckles.

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Okay.

138
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
So, those are the bumpy parts on my hand.

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Yeah.

140
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
The bones on the top part of your hand.

141
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,880
So, he's basically saying, do you want me to punch you?

142
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Right?

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
Do you want me to hit you with my hand, with my fist?

144
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,120
So, it's a very informal way of saying a punch, knuckle sandwich.

145
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
I'll give you a knuckle sandwich.

146
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Right.

147
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,360
And for our last word, he called...

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
Tommy called Sandy a pipsqueak.

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
A pipsqueak.

150
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
A pipsqueak.

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
A pipsqueak.

152
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,800
Now, this is kind of an insult, but again, very old-fashioned.

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Yes.

154
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,320
A pipsqueak is a very small person, right?

155
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,920
A small person who is not strong.

156
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Okay.

157
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Or not powerful.

158
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,520
So, a small and weak person.

159
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Pipsqueak.

161
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,320
I guess nowadays, you can still call somebody pipsqueak, but maybe in a lighter sense.

162
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,880
It would be a little bit funny to call someone a pipsqueak.

163
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Okay.

164
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,360
So, a pipsqueak.

165
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,320
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

166
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,440
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can get all these words that we just looked

167
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:28,920
at, and then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

168
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,800
Hey Tracy, how are you doing?

169
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm swell, Sandy.

170
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,400
Hey, listen, you want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

171
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,280
It'll be a blast.

172
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,480
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

173
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,040
The girls got to ask the guys.

174
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Also...

175
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Oh, right.

176
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,520
So, when are you going to ask me?

177
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,920
I've had my eye on you for a while.

178
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,600
Hey buddy, ease off my girl, man.

179
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,960
Cool it, guys.

181
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Your girl?

182
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,160
Says who?

183
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,480
Says me, pipsqueak.

184
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Okay.

185
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,320
So that was a little bit easier to understand, but some great 50s style phrases and words.

186
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,880
So why don't we look at some of these phrases now in Fluency Builder.

187
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Fluency Builder.

188
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
All right.

189
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,720
On Fluency Builder today, we're going to look at three phrases.

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,760
Why don't we start with the first one?

191
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,560
Sandy said that the party will be a blast.

192
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
It'll be a blast.

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,600
It'll be a blast.

194
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
To be a blast.

195
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
So if something is a blast, it's very fun.

196
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
It's entertaining.

197
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Yes.

198
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Really, really fun.

199
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Okay.

200
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
So the party was a blast.

201
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,760
I had a great time last night.

202
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,040
It was a blast.

203
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Okay.

204
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Very good.

205
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
So, very fun times.

206
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Yep.

207
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,000
And you'll still hear this phrase used today.

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now, the next one.

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,080
So Sandy said he had his eye on Tracy.

210
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,120
He said, I've had my eye on you.

211
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,880
To have your eye on someone.

212
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,440
So if I have my eye on the new iPhone that came out.

213
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,360
You are watching it carefully because you want it.

214
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Okay.

215
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,600
So I'm keeping my attention on it because I want it.

216
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,640
I have my eye on that sweater because it's on sale.

217
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Okay.

218
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,760
So you really want that sweater.

219
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Yep.

220
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
All right.

221
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,480
So to have your eye on something or on someone.

222
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Right.

223
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,240
So for our last phrase, Tommy told Sandy, hey buddy, ease off my girl.

224
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,760
Ease off.

225
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Ease off.

226
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Ease off.

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
All right.

228
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we could use ease off because it might

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
be a little bit tricky and then we'll come back and talk about it.

230
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,600
Example one.

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,440
You need to ease off the junk food.

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,560
Example two.

233
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,800
Matt is putting so much pressure on me these days.

234
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,720
I wish he would ease off.

235
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Example three.

236
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,400
You're pushing Susie too much.

237
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,840
You need to ease off a bit.

238
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,300
Okay.

239
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:26,320
So it looks like you say this phrase ease off when somebody is putting pressure on you

240
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
or doing something to you that they shouldn't.

241
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Right.

242
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,440
Maybe they're being too intense or maybe annoying you.

243
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,040
So you tell them, hey, ease off.

244
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Relax.

245
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Stay back.

246
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Stay away.

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Very good.

248
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
So ease off.

249
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Ease off my girlfriend.

250
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Ease off the fatty foods.

251
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
All right.

252
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
So take it easy.

253
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Stay away from.

254
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Yep.

255
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Okay.

256
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
So some great phrases there.

257
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,560
I think it's a good idea for us to listen to our dialogue one more time and then we'll

258
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:01,720
come back and talk a little bit more about the 1950s.

259
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
Hey Tracy, how are you doing?

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,680
I'm swell, Sandy.

261
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,760
Hey, listen, you want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

262
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
It'll be a blast.

263
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

264
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
The girls got to ask the guys.

265
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Also.

266
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Oh, right.

267
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
So when are you going to ask me?

268
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,320
I've had my eye on you for a while.

269
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,520
Hey, buddy, ease off my girl, man.

270
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,960
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

271
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,880
Cool it, guys.

272
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Your girl?

273
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
Says who?

274
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Says me, pipsqueak.

275
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,120
Okay.

276
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,680
So the 1950s, a nice era.

277
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,160
And this is the first of a small series that we're going to have of different words and

278
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,040
phrases that were used back in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, et cetera.

279
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
That's right.

280
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,920
And a lot more time travel is coming up here in EnglishPod.

281
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Exactly.

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Because a lot of these phrases are still used and you might even see them in movies or if

283
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,080
you're talking to somebody that was maybe born in these eras, they might even still

284
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
use them today.

285
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
That's right.

286
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,280
So do you guys know any English phrases or slangs from the 1950s?
