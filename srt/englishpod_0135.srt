00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,560
Welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,560
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,760
And my name is Kathryn.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,480
Today, Marco, what are we talking about?

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,560
Well, today we are not really in the best mood.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,560
What do you mean?

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,760
We're kind of sad.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,560
We're kind of nervous.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,080
We're not feeling very well.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
It's a cloudy day.

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Maybe that's why.

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
The blues.

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,080
The blues.

16
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,880
So, yeah, that's what we're talking about today.

17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,440
We're going to have a lot of different descriptive words to express maybe feeling sad or maybe

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,360
you're angry or you're nervous or something like that.

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Okay.

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,400
Well, this is a very useful lesson.

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,560
Hopefully, you're not feeling this way.

22
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,060
But if you have to talk about someone who is, I've got lots of words for you.

23
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,520
But first, we're going to preview a couple in today's vocabulary preview.

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Vocabulary preview.

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
All right.

26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,960
So, today on vocabulary preview, we're going to look at two words.

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,920
And the first one is a way of saying that you feel sad.

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,520
So, basically, I'm feeling down.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Okay.

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Down.

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
You might have heard this before because it's the opposite of the word up.

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Exactly.

33
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,560
So, you're not feeling up happy looking up.

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
You're feeling down.

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
This is another word for sad like Marco said.

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
Or you can also say I'm a bit down today, right?

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,320
Yeah, I'm a bit down today.

38
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
Or you look really down.

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Are you okay?

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Yeah.

41
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
So, you look sad.

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Are you... is everything okay?

43
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
So, down.

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,280
So, now another feeling or a way that a person is feeling, maybe that person is grouchy.

45
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,480
Would you please stop talking so loud, Marco?

46
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
I think you have...

47
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
No, I'm seriously.

48
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,160
Don't be grouchy, Kathryn.

49
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Geez.

50
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
No.

51
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,440
So, grouchy is a way someone acts, usually when they're in a bad mood.

52
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Right.

53
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,280
So, it's not like really angry.

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,520
You're not angry, but you're not very happy either.

55
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,000
And you're not very nice to people.

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
So, there's a very famous TV character called Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street.

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
Look for him on YouTube or Youku.

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,040
And he's very, very good for learning about this feeling, grouchy, because he's a grouchy

59
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
guy.

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
Yeah, he's always angry or never happy, basically.

61
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Right.

62
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
He's always complaining about something.

63
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,040
So, that word again is grouchy.

64
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
All right.

65
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,040
So, after taking a look at these two words, we're ready now to listen to our dialogue

66
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,360
for the first time.

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's see what this dialogue is about, if maybe they're grouchy or maybe just sad.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Fine.

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,480
I'll talk to you later.

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Bye.

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Carrie, are you okay?

73
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,000
You seem a bit down.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,200
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,280
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

76
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,840
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,520
He does have a pretty nerve-wracking job, you know.

79
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,280
I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,720
shuts down and brushes me off.

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,060
Men are like that, you know.

83
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,100
They can feel nervous, anxious, or on edge, and the only way they can express it is by

84
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,600
trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

85
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,160
I guess you're right.

86
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
What do you think I should do?

87
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,800
He wasn't always this grouchy, you know.

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Talk to him.

89
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Cheer him up when he's down, and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

90
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,800
You are something else, you know that?

91
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Alright so two girls talking about guys.

92
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,920
I guess guys have a bad temper sometimes, right?

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,040
I think anyone can have a bad temper, but we're talking today about the boyfriend of

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,080
one of these girls who has a very bad temper and has been very grouchy recently.

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
And that's why she's feeling a bit down.

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,240
So let's take a look at those words now in Language Takeaway.

97
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Language Takeaway Alright so in today's Language Takeaway,

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
we've got some wonderful words for you.

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,200
Words that are very good for describing stress or having anxiety.

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,880
The first of these words is something you hear all the time, especially with young people.

101
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,560
Right, somebody is stressed out.

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh my gosh, Marco, I'm so stressed out.

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,920
I have ten homework assignments to do and softball practice and my mom wants me to help

104
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,320
cook dinner tonight.

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
You really are stressed out.

106
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I am stressed out.

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't have any homework and I don't live with my mom.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,560
But being stressed out is usually something you feel when you have too much stuff to do.

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,200
So maybe you can be stressed out because of school, like in your case, or maybe at work

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,720
you have a lot of things to do or a project to finish, right?

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,240
Exactly and I just want to point out here that you can say I'm stressed or I'm feeling

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,600
stressed but commonly in spoken English, so when you're talking to your friends, you hear

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,360
this much more often, stressed out.

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
Stressed out, he's really stressed out lately.

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,640
So we're stressed out or another word that kind of means the same is this is nerve-wracking.

116
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,700
Nerve-wracking, so nerves are those things in our body that help us feel things, right?

117
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,560
And so something that racks our nerves makes us very, very tense, very anxious, very uncomfortable.

118
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Okay, so it makes you very nervous.

119
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,680
Right, so there are some movies that are nerve-wracking.

120
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,080
For example, suspense movies like Hitchcock's movies like Psycho or The Birds.

121
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,440
Like Horror, like maybe Saw.

122
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,280
Nerve-wracking, also some people think that roller coasters are nerve-wracking.

123
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,040
They're very, very anxious when they ride roller coasters.

124
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,720
Right, so let's listen to a couple of more examples of in different situations where

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
we can use this phrase nerve-wracking.

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Example one.

127
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,880
I think being a doctor is one of the most nerve-wracking jobs in the world.

128
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,240
Example two.

129
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,760
Skydiving was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life.

130
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,540
I almost had a heart attack.

131
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,880
Example three.

132
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,640
The final match between Brazil and Italy was incredibly nerve-wracking.

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,000
And there's another way to describe this feeling.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,880
Again, it's a little bit different but very, very similar.

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,580
We can say someone is feeling on edge.

136
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,760
On edge.

137
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,120
So this person was feeling on edge, but what does that mean exactly?

138
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,640
You're like at the edge?

139
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,600
Why do you have to ask so many questions?

140
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, listen.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is basic.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, Marco?

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right, all right.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
Are you mocking me?

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm on edge today.

146
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
All right.

147
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,000
So someone who is on edge is easily angered, right?

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,700
So it's very easy to make this person upset or angry.

149
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,880
Someone who just quit smoking might be on edge.

150
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,200
That means it's very, very easy to get them to be upset.

151
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Wow.

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,680
So yeah, you are on edge, right?

153
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Exactly.

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,040
He's on edge or he seems on edge, doesn't he?

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay, very good.

156
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,560
Wow, these three words that we've just looked at are really interesting and very, very useful.

157
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,480
I guess you can describe many different situations or a person that's going through these feelings,

158
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
right?

159
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Absolutely.

160
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,000
I think there is a thousand ways to describe being nervous or anxious or upset.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,440
So maybe we should take another listen to today's dialogue and figure out how exactly

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,320
we use these words and we come back.

163
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,760
We'll be talking about some other phrases that are useful.

164
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,720
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

165
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Bye.

166
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,360
Carrie, are you okay?

167
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
You seem a bit down.

168
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,600
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

169
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,720
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

170
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,260
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

171
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,440
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something.

172
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,080
He does have a pretty nerve wracking job, you know.

173
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,520
Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood.

174
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,680
I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always

175
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,120
shuts down and brushes me off.

176
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
Men are like that, you know.

177
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,800
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge.

178
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,640
And the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

179
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,600
I guess you're right.

180
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
What do you think I should do?

181
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,200
He wasn't always as grouchy, you know.

182
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,440
Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down.

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,280
If that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,280
You are something else, you know that.

185
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,720
All right, great.

186
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,880
So now that we're back, we can start with a couple of different phrases now on Fluency

187
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,960
Builder.

188
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Fluency Builder.

189
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
All right.

190
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,400
So, Marco, here's the big question.

191
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,640
What makes you lose your temper?

192
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,680
I think what makes me lose my temper very, very easily is like a dirty house or like

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
a dirty room.

194
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Really?

195
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
You're a neat freak.

196
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,880
Not really neat freak, but like if it's not at least semi-clean, you know, it really bothers

197
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
me.

198
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay.

199
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,680
So this great phrase, lose your temper or lose one's temper is a phrase we use in English

200
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,560
to describe getting angry.

201
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
All right.

202
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
So maybe you're okay.

203
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,200
You're frustrated with something, but someone does something like throws all of their clothes

204
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,880
on the floor and Marco here says, that's it.

205
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm tired of this.

206
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
You're always throwing your clothes on the floor.

207
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
And that's an example of Marco losing his temper.

208
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
What about you?

209
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
What makes you lose your temper?

210
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
You hear this?

211
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
What is that?

212
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh, drilling, construction, hammering.

213
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,280
When people tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, or when they like stomp their feet, feet,

214
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
feet.

215
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Like when they're nervous.

216
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
When they make noise, yeah.

217
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,760
So slowly it's like, okay, fine.

218
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Calm down.

219
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
It's okay.

220
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Okay.

221
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
No, seriously, stop it.

222
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,480
And then all of a sudden, I just can't stand it anymore.

223
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
You explode.

224
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Exactly.

225
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
So, all right.

226
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
So that's what makes you lose your temper.

227
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,760
I'll be sure to keep my eye out for that.

228
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Please don't.

229
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
All right.

230
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
All right.

231
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
So, okay.

232
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,520
You lose your temper and now there are situations sometimes where you need to brush someone off.

233
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,600
All right.

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,680
Or when you get brushed off and that's not very good feeling.

235
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,600
But this phrase, to brush someone off, you've heard the word brush before.

236
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,720
It's the word that we use to, you know, brush your hair or brush your teeth.

237
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Exactly.

238
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,840
When you brush someone off, it's like saying that you're ignoring them.

239
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah.

240
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,200
So you ignore them or you basically tell them to go away very subtly sometimes or very directly.

241
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Exactly.

242
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,640
And so to brush someone off is to avoid their company.

243
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,520
And so a lot of times when people are angry, they like to be alone.

244
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,400
So they brush you off.

245
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,440
I could say, hey, did you want to go see that movie tonight?

246
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
Oh, no, I can't.

247
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,120
I have to do something tonight.

248
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,080
And then Marco walks away while we're talking.

249
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
He's brushing me off.

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,040
He's ignoring me.

251
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
So it happens.

252
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,200
And also maybe some people can make up excuses and that's also brushing someone off.

253
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Right.

254
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Right.

255
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Exactly.

256
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,720
So to brush someone off or he brushed me off doesn't feel good.

257
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
All right.

258
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,080
And well, all of these, all of these bad feelings, brushing somebody off, maybe you feel stressed

259
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,840
out in the end, you always need a good friend to cheer you up.

260
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Right.

261
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
And that's what this dialogue is all about.

262
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Exactly.

263
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,400
And so friends are actually the people that do that the best or family, I think.

264
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,400
And well, we can break this phrase down because most of it's pretty clear, but cheer might

265
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,640
be a new word for some of our listeners.

266
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,680
Maybe we've heard of the term cheerleader, you know, like give me an A, give me a B.

267
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,720
So cheer or people cheering or cheers when the beer.

268
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
So cheer is like happiness.

269
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,960
So someone who can cheer you up is someone who makes you happy.

270
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,640
Remember that down we had earlier, I'm feeling down.

271
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
We're trying to cheer someone up.

272
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
We're trying to make them go up and be happy.

273
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Exactly.

274
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,440
So you want to cheer up your friends or maybe if you're feeling a bit down, a family member

275
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,920
will try and cheer you up.

276
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Do you need someone to cheer you up, Marco?

277
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Yes, I do.

278
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,480
Let's go have a drink and eat some popcorn and be cheered up.

279
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
That's what cheers me up or chocolate always cheers me up.

280
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
Oh, I know there's some of that.

281
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
All right.

282
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,160
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases, but the last sentence of the dialogue is maybe

283
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,960
a little bit strange, right?

284
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,560
When she says, you are something else.

285
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
You know that?

286
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Something what?

287
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Is she an alien?

288
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Is she a monkey?

289
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
What does she mean when she says you are something else?

290
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
That's a great question.

291
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,640
Well, this might be a little bit hard to understand at first, but she's saying, I can't believe

292
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
you.

293
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,920
She's like, there's no one like you.

294
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,000
You're really something else.

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You know that?

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,320
It's kind of like a joke, but what she's saying is, I can't believe you.

297
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,320
You just want to go on and encourage me to find another boy.

298
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
You're unbelievable.

299
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,920
So it could be, is it on the positive note or can it be both positive and negative?

300
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,800
Well, here we've got two friends who are using it, so it's a positive note, but she's kind

301
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
of making fun of her saying, I can't believe you.

302
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
But it can be negative.

303
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
It can be more negative.

304
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,200
Like if you're fighting with her boyfriend and her boyfriend cheats on her and she's

305
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,800
like, you're really something else.

306
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
You know that?

307
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
It's like, there's no comparison.

308
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You're the worst.

309
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Yeah, exactly.

310
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,360
So yeah, it really depends on how this is used and what the tone of voice is, so how

311
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
someone says it.

312
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,800
But in this case, I think it's kind of a joke, but it's the positive.

313
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Right.

314
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Very interesting.

315
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,280
It's very spoken English, as you say, because all the words that we see there, they're pretty

316
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,880
simple, but the context or the connotation, the meaning is very, very different from the

317
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
actual words.

318
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Exactly.

319
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
All right.

320
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,440
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

321
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
bit more.

322
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Okay.

323
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
I'll talk to you later.

324
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Bye.

325
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Carrie, are you okay?

326
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
You seem a bit down.

327
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend.

328
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing.

329
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
It's so hard to talk to him at times.

330
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out all the time.

331
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I don't know.

332
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
I don't know.

333
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
I don't know.

334
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't know.

335
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I don't know.

336
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I don't know.

337
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I don't know.

338
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I don't know.

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I don't know.

340
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
I don't know.

341
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I don't know.

342
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I don't know.

343
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't know.

344
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
I don't know.

345
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I don't know.

346
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I don't know.

347
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
I don't know.

348
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't know.

349
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I don't know.

350
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
I don't know.

351
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I don't know.

352
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I don't know.

353
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Sorry I didn't catch it.

354
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
It's crazy how he just doesn't sound as upset as he seems.

355
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Like he just seems really stressed out from working or something.

356
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know?

357
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah but he's always in a really foul mood.

358
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
I tried to find out what's bothering him, or get to him to talk about his day, but he

359
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,260
always shuts down and brushes me off.

360
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,600
Men are like that you know.

361
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,640
They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by

362
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,220
trying to hide it through aggressiveness.

363
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,220
I guess you're right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy, you know.

364
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,220
Talk to him. Try to cheer him up when he's down. And if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one.

365
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
You are something else, you know that?

366
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,220
So, Catherine, are you a grouchy person? Are you happy? Do you have a bad temper?

367
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:04,220
Oh, these are, well, very interesting questions, Marco. Thank you for asking. No, the first time, am I grouchy? No, not very. Only before 9am.

368
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
You're not a morning person.

369
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Not a morning person, so I'm very grouchy in the morning. But I'm generally pretty good about losing my temper. It doesn't happen very often.

370
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Oh, really?

371
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,220
But I do get frustrated with things like tapping or when people eat with their mouth open.

372
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Oh, yeah, that's terrible. I hate that as well.

373
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
Yeah, I can't stand it.

374
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Or I really don't like when people bite their nails. It also makes me lose my temper. I don't know. It more than makes me lose my temper, it's kind of annoying, right?

375
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,220
It is annoying. So what makes you really lose your temper? We say, what makes you blow your top? Think about a volcano.

376
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Really grinds my gears. I would say the worst is when somebody lies to me, like straight in my face.

377
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,220
Like I know they're lying. I know you're lying and you still just lie straight at me.

378
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,220
I agree. So what's something that really cheers you up? Because we talked about like going out with a friend maybe helps you cheer up.

379
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,220
But is there one thing, some kind of remedy?

380
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,220
I actually like to go shopping when I'm feeling a bit sad.

381
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Really?

382
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Yeah. I mean, I won't buy anything like clothes or anything like that. Usually I'll get maybe something for somebody else or for the house or something. It's very strange.

383
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
Helps you like clear your mind.

384
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,220
Yeah, it's just like walking around and spending a little bit of money. I don't know. It's kind of a good remedy.

385
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Yeah, I think so.

386
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
What about you? What cheers you up?

387
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
I kind of like to organize things.

388
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Really?

389
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Yeah. So if I'm really angry or really upset about something, I'll alphabetize all of my books.

390
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Oh, wow.

391
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
