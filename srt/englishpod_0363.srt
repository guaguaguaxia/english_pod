00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,120
My name is Kathryn and today we're talking about a special kind of man.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
That's right.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,640
Today we are, well, everyone starts living with your parents but as adults, some people

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,020
still want to continue living with their parents.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
That's right.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,480
So the topic of today's lesson is living with your parents when you're an adult.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Let's take a listen to the dialogue.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,960
Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,040
I don't know.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,960
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,280
is all a bunch of crap.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,800
Well, you still live with your parents so she does have a point.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,880
What do you mean?

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,080
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
the economy.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,400
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,800
Plus, you make good money so there's really no excuse.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
That's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Whatever, dude.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,280
I have everything I need.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
Why would I move out?

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
Have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
What else could a guy ask for?

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Let's agree to disagree.

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,920
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,000
So now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,720
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,160
The first verb we have here is to break up.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,840
So we heard the guy say, why did your girlfriend break up with you?

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
That's right.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,200
So this is a phrasal verb and to break up in a relationship or in a romantic sense means

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,440
to end a relationship.

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,880
So if you break up with your girlfriend, it means you end the relationship.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
That's right.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,840
So you think about breaking something, it goes into pieces.

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, in a relationship, it means you both leave each other, you go your separate ways.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,140
And so you can say, he broke up with me or we broke up.

40
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,160
That's right.

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,960
And the reason his girlfriend broke up with him is because she said he was not independent.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,520
So she wanted him to be more independent.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,040
So independent means that you do things on your own.

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,200
When you're, you know, you do things alone.

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,640
You don't expect other people to help you.

46
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,840
You don't depend on other people.

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Exactly.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,860
So you can say, he's very independent.

49
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,840
He loves to travel alone.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Okay.

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
So it means that you don't really need other people's help, I guess, right?

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Exactly.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Okay.

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
All right.

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,360
So he's not really very independent and well, his friend agrees.

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
He says, well, you know what?

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,880
I think she has a point.

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,480
To have a point means to say something that the other person agrees with.

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Okay.

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,000
So you could say, he has a point.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
I agree with him.

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
That's a good argument.

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Right.

64
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,960
So if somebody says something and you agree with that, when you say, yeah, you have a

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,800
point, it means you agree with the argument.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,600
You agree with what that person says.

67
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
All right.

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,000
And now lastly, because he lives with his parents, his friend is saying that he should

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
move out.

70
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
You should move out.

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,000
So here's another phrasal verb, to move out.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,120
This means that you leave the house and you find a new house.

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,600
So when you're with your parents, you want to move out.

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,000
That means you don't live with your parents anymore, but you find your own house.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,040
So, well, in general, when you find your own house, when you leave and your current place

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,400
of living, that's moving out, right?

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
That's right.

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,140
So if I'm leaving the city, I move out of my house.

80
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,680
And then when I arrive in a new city, I move in to a new house.

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Oh, very good.

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,480
So to move out and to move in, they go hand in hand.

83
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
All right.

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:51,560
So let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

86
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
I don't know.

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,560
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,880
is all a bunch of crap.

89
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,400
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,480
What do you mean?

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,680
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in

92
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
the economy.

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,440
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

95
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

96
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Whatever, dude.

97
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,880
I have everything I need.

98
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Why would I move out?

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,640
I have a great roof over my head.

100
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
My mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

101
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
What else could a guy ask for?

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Let's agree to disagree.

103
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,760
All right.

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,960
So now four phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

105
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Fluency Builder.

106
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,080
So we've got a very interesting phrase here at the beginning of Fluency Builder today.

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,560
The phrase is manning up.

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,000
So the girlfriend was tired of the man not manning up.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,760
So to man up.

111
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
And what does that mean?

112
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,320
To man up to something?

113
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,480
It means to be responsible or to be more mature or to be an adult about something.

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,360
So maybe this guy, this man, he's kind of immature.

115
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,880
He lives at home.

116
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,720
He's not very responsible or independent.

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
And his girlfriend wanted him to be more responsible, more independent.

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,200
So she wanted him to man up.

119
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
That's right.

120
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,720
So it usually means that you also should accept the consequences for your actions.

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Right.

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Exactly.

123
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
So you might push someone to man up, take responsibility for something and do it even

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,200
though the consequences might not be fun or good.

125
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,760
Now this remember is very, very much slang.

126
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,320
So you don't say this in an essay or a paper.

127
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,960
This is what you say between friends.

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Okay.

129
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,720
And another slang phrase here that we use to describe this man is a mama's boy.

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,640
He says, his friend says he's a mama's boy.

131
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Mama's boy.

132
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,560
So mama is mother.

133
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Mama's boy means that he's very, very close with his mother.

134
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,800
This is not a good thing to say.

135
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,640
It's usually something that's a little bit critical.

136
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Okay.

137
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
So say he's a mama's boy.

138
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Okay.

139
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,520
So his mother washes his clothes, she cooks his food, she does everything for him.

140
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Right.

141
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,000
And he doesn't do anything for himself.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's like a little baby.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,840
He's like a child and his mama, his mother does everything for him.

144
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
So it is a little bit like an insult, I guess.

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes.

146
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Okay.

147
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,720
So it's not really a good thing to call someone a mama's boy unless in this situation, they're

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,760
friends and his friend is saying, well, you know what?

149
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,600
It seems like you're a mama's boy.

150
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Exactly.

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
All right.

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,120
So our next phrase is when he was justifying and say, why would I move out?

153
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,000
Why would I leave my parents' house?

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,360
I have a great roof over my head.

155
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,840
So what does he mean by a great roof?

156
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Okay.

157
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,320
So the roof means the top of your house.

158
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
You know, obviously our houses, they're not open.

159
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,180
They have a cover and that's called a roof.

160
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,560
But the phrase here, a roof over my head or a roof over one's head means a place to live.

161
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay.

162
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
A home.

163
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,080
So if you say, I don't have a roof over my head, that means I don't have a home.

164
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I don't have a house.

165
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Okay.

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,480
So he's saying that he has a great roof over his head.

167
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,120
His mom does everything for him.

168
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,040
So he's like, why would I move out?

169
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,800
And his friend ends the conversation by saying, you know what?

170
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,040
Let's agree to disagree.

171
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,800
This is a really important phrase to learn, especially if you like to argue a lot.

172
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,200
In this case, one guy said, listen, living at home is good.

173
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
It works for me.

174
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
And the other said, no, it's not very responsible.

175
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I agree with your girlfriend.

176
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,400
And at the end, they still believe what they thought originally.

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
So they agree to disagree.

178
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,160
That means they're not going to argue anymore, but they're not going to change their minds.

179
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Right.

180
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,120
So I respect your opinion and you respect my opinion and the conversation is over.

181
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,880
So Marco, chocolate ice cream is clearly the best ice cream.

182
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,080
Vanilla ice cream is the best.

183
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,240
Yeah, no, I think chocolate has more flavor.

184
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,520
No, vanilla is tastier.

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,120
Okay, let's agree to disagree.

186
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
I still think chocolate is the best.

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Marco still thinks vanilla is the best, but we're not going to argue anymore.

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
Okay, great.

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:14,040
So let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

190
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Why did your girlfriend break up with you?

191
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,120
I don't know.

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,040
She said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
is all a bunch of crap.

194
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,880
Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

195
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
What do you mean?

196
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,160
A lot of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in

197
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
the economy.

198
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
Yeah, but you're almost 40.

199
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,920
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.

200
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,960
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

201
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Whatever, dude.

202
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,360
I have everything I need.

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,740
Why would I move out?

204
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,120
Have a great roof over my head.

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,100
My mom does my laundry and cooks for me.

206
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,000
What else could a guy ask for?

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Let's agree to disagree.

208
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,640
All right, so talking about a mama's boy living at home.

209
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:05,240
Now, as he mentioned, in the United States, kids usually leave home when they're 18 or

210
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,880
19 when they go to college, right?

211
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,880
But in other places, like in Latin America or even, for example, in many parts of Europe,

212
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,600
people will live at home until they're 24 or 26 because it is expensive to live by yourself.

213
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,440
It is, and so in a lot of these countries, you hear people maybe joking about the men

214
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,000
being mama's boys.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,240
Like Italy, for example, this is often something that people like to joke about.

216
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,880
Obviously, it's not true in most cases, but it is true that a lot of people live with

217
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,960
their families until later because, like you say, it's expensive or maybe in their culture,

218
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,200
in their tradition, you don't leave your home until you get married.

219
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,680
Right, because it could be also for religious reasons.

220
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,000
Exactly, and so I think it differs from culture to culture, but this idea of a mama's boy

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,100
is very, very much a part of American culture.

222
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,320
We often talk about this.

223
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,840
We often joke about it, and sometimes you say, oh, you're such a mama's boy because

224
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,120
my brother sometimes, he calls my mom a lot.

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,040
I say, oh, you're such a mama's boy, always calling mom.

226
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,800
Now, obviously, this works for guys, but what about girls?

227
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
Would you say like daddy's girl?

228
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah, a little bit.

229
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,040
It's usually girls who get everything they want from their dads.

230
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,080
Like, daddy, I want a new car.

231
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Daddy, I want new clothes.

232
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,440
Yeah, so daddy's girl is someone who is very close with their dad and maybe is able

233
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,120
to have him give her lots of stuff that she wants.

234
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,840
So we don't really hear like daddy's boy or mama's girl very often, right?

235
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
No, it's the opposite.

236
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
It's always the opposite.

237
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

238
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,520
Well, it's a very interesting topic, and I'm sure many of you in your different cultures

239
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,720
may also continue living with your parents, or maybe it's not common, or maybe even after

240
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,680
marriage in many parts of Asia, people get married and live at home with their in-laws.

241
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,760
That's right, so we're very curious to hear about your experience in your country.

242
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,760
If you have such a thing as a mama's boy or a daddy's girl, let us know.
