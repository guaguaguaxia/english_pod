00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,800
My name is Catherine and today we have another episode in our series all about small talk.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
That's right.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,160
Today we're going to take a look at a work setting where two colleagues maybe run into

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,160
each other and they talk very briefly about something.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,280
Alright so let's check out today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,280
Hi Michelle, do you need to use the photocopier?

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,120
Oh hi Jeremy.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,200
No please, go ahead.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,160
So how are you Jeremy?

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,440
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,960
Oh I'm fine, thanks.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,480
I'm super busy with work actually.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,280
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
No tell me more.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,880
Well I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawson's

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
last week.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
And?

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,160
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,680
Fingers crossed.

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,480
That's great news Jeremy.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Congratulations.

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Anyway, I must get back but give my regards to your wife Monica.

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,280
I will Michelle.

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Speak to you soon.

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,920
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,080
Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,680
So the first word for you guys today is photocopier.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
Now this is something that's very common in offices.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,080
That's right, a photocopier, also known as a copy machine or just copier.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Yeah this is something that you use to print on paper or to copy paper.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,040
So if I have a document but I want another copy of it, I put it on this machine and it

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,640
will copy it and print it out.

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
That's right.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,520
So those are the ways that you know this machine by this name.

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,800
Either photocopier, copy machine or just copier.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,040
Alright but after that we have a very interesting adjective.

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,480
This is something that we use very often in spoken English.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,560
The phrase here Marco was I'm super busy but what does it mean to say you're super something?

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
That's right.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,360
So when we add the word super to an adjective, we mean that we're very, very, very busy,

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
super busy.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
Alright so I'm super hungry.

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,600
That means you're very, very, very hungry.

46
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,840
Alright or I'm super woman.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,000
Also it means that you are very much a great woman.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Alright like superman is very good at going fast and doing things and so he's super means

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,840
great or exceptional.

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,000
So in this case I'm exceptionally busy.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
That's right.

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,360
And moving on to the next line where Jeremy says that he was discussing the contract with

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Bill.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
So a contract, we know what this means.

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah what is this?

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,120
So a contract is a document and it's something that you have to have two or more groups for

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
or two or more parties.

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
So Marco between you and me, we could have a contract.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
It says that when we come to record, you will be respectful of me.

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
That's right.

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
And then we will both sign.

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,440
So it's kind of an agreement between two as you said or more people and but you are promising

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,440
to respect the contract and to do what the contract says.

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,160
And if you don't do what the contract says, we have a special verb.

65
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
We say you broke the contract.

66
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,120
So to break, break a contract.

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
That's right.

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,200
So Jeremy was discussing the contract with Bill and they said they met the head of Lawsons.

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
Now Lawsons is a company that we're just using for the dialogue.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,600
But what does it mean the head of this company?

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,440
Okay if you think about the company as a body, the head is the top.

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,640
And in this case that would be the president or the manager or the leader.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,240
It's the most important person.

74
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Okay so we can also use this in our offices for example the person in charge of marketing,

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
the director of marketing.

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,440
We also call him the head of marketing.

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,200
Or the head of the sales division would be the manager of the sales team or whoever is

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
most important in sales.

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,920
Another very common example I think is the president.

80
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,160
Many times they call him the head of state.

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Yeah the head of state.

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,880
So you can have a dinner with many heads of state.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,880
And those could be kings or queens or presidents.

84
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Very good.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,840
Alright so that's all the vocab for language.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:19,600
Take away why don't we take a short break and listen to the dialogue again.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,720
Hi Michelle do you need to use the photocopier?

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Oh hi Jeremy.

89
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,640
No please go ahead.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
So how are you Jeremy?

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,400
Oh I'm fine thanks.

93
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm super busy with work actually.

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,360
No tell me more.

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,320
Well I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawson's

97
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
last week.

98
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
And?

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,720
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

100
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Fingers crossed.

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
That's great news Jeremy.

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Congratulations.

103
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,360
Anyway I must get back but give my regards to your wife Monica.

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
I will Michelle.

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Speak to you soon.

106
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,760
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

107
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
Fluency Builder.

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,560
So there's a great phrase here in Fluency Builder that we use when we're trying to be

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,160
polite in English.

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,920
Michelle says oh hi Jeremy please go ahead.

111
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Okay so Jeremy asks if she needs to use the photocopier and he said no Jeremy it's okay

112
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
go ahead.

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Please go ahead.

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:32,520
This literally means you go ahead of me but in reality she's basically saying I can wait

115
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,620
you go first.

116
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,520
So if you're going into a building and somebody opens the door before you and they say please

117
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
go ahead.

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,720
That means they'll hold the door and you can go inside first.

119
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,200
So please go ahead.

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,600
This is a very polite thing to do and if you're in line and you see someone is in a hurry

121
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
you can say this to them please go ahead.

122
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,720
Alright very good.

123
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Please go ahead.

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,480
And we also going back to the contract discussed about confirming the deal.

125
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Okay.

126
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,200
So you have a deal or an agreement or a contract but the thing you do to make sure that you

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,740
all agree is you confirm.

128
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,360
So this means you want to make sure it is actually going to happen.

129
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,360
And you can actually combine confirm with many different things like you can confirm

130
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,840
your tickets to go to Italy or can we confirm those holidays before I make my bookings because

131
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,560
I want to go to Italy.

132
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Exactly.

133
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,720
So you confirm something and then Jeremy said a very strange phrase here fingers crossed

134
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,180
after talking about the deal.

135
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,080
Okay so fingers crossed is an interesting phrase.

136
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,520
It doesn't mean okay now go cross your fingers but it's something we say to be superstitious

137
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,560
because it means basically I hope so or hopefully because fingers crossed when you cross your

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,440
fingers in many Anglo-American cultures you are saying that you hope something will happen.

139
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,960
It's to bring good luck.

140
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,080
So oh gosh I really hope it doesn't rain today.

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,640
And then I say fingers crossed.

142
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,200
Yeah well fingers crossed it doesn't.

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,040
That means that we hope it doesn't but now that you said that maybe it will.

144
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Right.

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,840
So I think it's kind of a superstitious belief that people have that if you cross your fingers

146
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,520
it will bring good luck or what you say will happen will happen or won't happen.

147
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
That's right fingers crossed.

148
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
All right.

149
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,920
So let's take a break now and listen to our dialogue one last time.

150
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Hi Michelle.

151
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,080
Do you need to use the photocopier?

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Oh hi Jeremy.

153
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,980
No please go ahead.

154
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,920
So how are you Jeremy?

155
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,480
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
Oh I'm fine thanks.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,280
I'm super busy with work actually.

158
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,080
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

159
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,720
No tell me more.

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,680
Well I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawson's

161
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
last week.

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
And?

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,400
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

164
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,480
Fingers crossed.

165
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,520
That's great news Jeremy.

166
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
Congratulations.

167
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,720
Anyway I must get back but give my regards to your wife Monica.

168
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,040
I will Michelle.

169
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,920
Speak to you soon.

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,080
So this is a very common scenario in a very in an office in a normal office setting where

171
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,640
maybe you meet your friend at in the kitchen or the water cooler the photocopier and you

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,080
have very small brief conversations.

173
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,680
That's right and you're often going to hear this called water cooler talk because you

174
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
don't want to have a long conversation about something really deep at the water cooler

175
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,520
