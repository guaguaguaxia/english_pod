00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm Amira.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,440
Amira and I are here today with another interesting and useful lesson for you English learners.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,360
Amira, why don't you explain a little bit of what this lesson is about today?

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,360
It's about calling in sick.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,480
Oh, okay. That's useful.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,160
Yes, definitely. It happens to everyone once in a while. You don't feel so well or you

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
feel well but you don't want to go to work.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Right.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,120
So, you call in sick.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,080
Okay. Okay. Let's listen to this dialogue and I want everyone to keep their ears open

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,560
and see if the boss believes this person.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Let's listen.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:52,640
Hello, Daniel speaking. How may I help you?

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Hi Daniel. Julie here.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh, hi Julie. How are you?

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,920
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,280
I think I'm coming down with the flu. I have a headache, a sore throat, a runny nose and

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm feeling slightly feverish.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,160
I see. So, you're calling in sick.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,400
Yes. I was hoping to take the day off to recover.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:29,560
Okay then. Try and get some rest.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,320
Marco do you think he believed her?

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,080
No, I don't think he believed her. He didn't sound really convinced.

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,280
Yes, and Julie didn't sound really sick, huh?

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,680
Exactly. Well, we have some really good vocabulary here. Amiro, why don't you begin with the

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
first one?

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,440
The first phrase I've chosen for you is a very, very useful one. I'm feeling quite ill

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
today.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm feeling quite ill today.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm feeling quite ill today.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Alright. What does this mean exactly?

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,880
It means that she's feeling sick.

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, okay. That's clear. So, she is sick. She's feeling sick.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,960
Okay, let's look at another really useful phrase and this one is I'm coming down with

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
the flu.

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm coming down with the flu.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm coming down with the flu.

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm coming down with the flu.

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,960
Alright and this phrase means that I am starting to get the flu or I am getting the flu.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,160
Okay. The next phrase I have for you is calling in sick.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Calling in sick.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
Calling in sick.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Calling in sick.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,320
It means calling your boss to tell him that you can't come to work today. I personally

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,680
love this phrase because it saves so much time and explanations.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, perfect. So, if I say this then everyone will know that I am not coming to work today.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Yes, definitely.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,160
Perfect. Alright. And the last phrase that we're going to take a look at today is I was

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,880
hoping to take the day off.

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,560
I was hoping to take the day off.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,160
I was hoping to take the day off.

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,960
I was hoping to take the day off.

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,680
Right. And she says this to ask for permission because she does not want to go to work.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,320
Okay. Now, couldn't she just say like I can't come today?

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,080
Right. She could say I can't come today but that would be a little bit impolite.

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,920
Okay. So, when she says I was hoping to take the day off, it's a polite way of asking.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,840
It's a polite way. Exactly. Because she is talking to her boss.

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,480
Very good. So, let's listen to the dialogue one more time.

61
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,240
The dialogue is a little different this time. Listen carefully and see if you think the

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
boss believes her this time.

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,160
Hello, Daniel speaking. How may I help you?

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,880
Hi Daniel. Julie here.

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh, hi Julie. How are you?

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,280
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,520
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,880
I think I'm coming down with the flu. I have a headache, a sore throat, a runny nose and

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm feeling slightly feverish.

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
I see. So, you're calling in sick?

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,320
Yes. I was hoping to take the day off to recover.

72
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,520
Okay then. Try and get some rest.

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:47,840
Okay, guys. We're back and I do think he believed her this time.

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,960
Yeah, I think he was understanding when he said, okay then, try and get some rest.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah, and Julie sounded pretty sick.

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Yes, yes she did.

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah, it was convincing.

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,800
Well, you know what? I almost called in sick last week.

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Really?

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,920
Yeah, I wasn't feeling very well and so I almost didn't come to work.

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,560
Oh, that would have been really bad for me. I would have been stuck here without you, Marco.

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,680
Yeah, you would have had to do the podcast all by yourself.

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Oh no.

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,200
You know, actually, I had the same symptoms as Julie. I also had a headache and I had

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,160
a sore throat and also the worst thing and the thing that I hate the most is I had a

86
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
runny nose.

87
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh no, that's really bad because then you have to like blow your nose all the time and

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,120
then it gets red and it hurts, right?

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,480
Exactly, yeah. Luckily, I didn't have a fever though.

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,160
Oh, thank God.

91
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,200
So did you take some medicine and it just killed everything?

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah, I had a friend and he had some pills for the flu and he just gave me a couple and

93
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,200
I felt better in about two days.

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,360
Oh, great. Well, so guys, let me tell you about a very funny thing that really happens

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,200
in real life in Egypt.

96
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,920
What story do you have for us today?

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,560
Well, it's actually not a story. It's a fact. I mean, people in Egypt, when they're sick,

98
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,200
they never call in sick themselves. They'll have someone do that for them.

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, that's interesting. Why? Why do they do this?

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, there is this weird speculation about, you know, if you can make it to the phone, you can make it to the office.

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,000
I agree. I agree. If I were a boss, I would do the same thing.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,800
