00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,640
My name is Katherine and today we have a very serious dialogue for you.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
That's right.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,160
We are going to talk about a will and testament, the last will and testament of someone.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,200
Alright, so what is a will and testament?

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,960
Well basically this is a document that someone writes, usually with a lawyer, that explains

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,360
what to do with the person's body and their possessions, their things, after they die.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,640
So many people write these and the family will then use it to discover who gets to receive

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,800
certain objects and what to do with this person's body.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,080
Right, exactly.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,520
So that is a last will and testament.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,320
We are going to take a look at an example of one so you would see more or less in English

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160
how one is written.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
Now obviously they can be very long and very complex.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,560
So we've taken one that has some interesting words there that are a little bit more specific,

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,520
a lot of legal terms there.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:11,800
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and we'll be back shortly.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,640
Last will and testament of Luke Thompson.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,040
I Luke Thompson residing in California, being of sound mind, do hereby declare this instrument

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,400
to be my last will and testament.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,320
I hereby revoke all previous wills and codicils.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,360
I direct that the disposition of my remains be as follows.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm to be cremated and taken to the summit of Mount Everest where my ashes will forever

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,760
remain at the ceiling of the earth.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,680
I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my spouse, Betty Thompson, should she survive

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,080
me for 60 days.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,120
If my spouse, Betty Thompson, does not survive me, I give all the rest and residue of my

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,760
estate to English Pod.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,240
If neither Betty Thompson nor English Pod survives me, I give all the rest and residue

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,560
of my estate to my heirs as determined by the laws of the state of California relating

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,920
to descent and distribution.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,840
I appoint Robert Porter to act as the executor of this will, to serve without bond.

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,080
Should Robert Porter be unable or unwilling to serve, then I appoint Jason Smalls to act

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,320
as the executor of this will.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,800
I herewith affix my signature to this will on this the 23rd of May, 2010 in the presence

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,080
of the following witnesses who witnessed and subscribed this will at my request and in

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
my presence.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,080
All right, we're back.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,080
So now we're going to take a look at five key words on Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,160
Okay, the first word here in Language Takeaway comes from the very beginning of this monologue.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,040
We're reading the last will in Testament aloud.

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,800
I Luke Thompson residing in California being of sound mind.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Sound as an adjective.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What does this mean?

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
That's very interesting.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,780
So he says, I am in sound mind and sound is an adjective to describe I am in a good state

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
of mind.

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
That's right.

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,720
So he's not having any problems or logical or unaffected.

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Basically I'm not crazy.

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Right.

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm not crazy.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,240
I don't have any problems.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
We can say this about other things too.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
We can say he's of sound body.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Right.

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
That means that he is healthy.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,200
He has no problems with his body.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,880
Or I could say, Marco, that's a really good decision.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,520
It's a sound decision.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,040
So again, that's also a way of saying good or it will work.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
It will work.

65
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
It's a good decision.

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Right.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,320
So you can use this adjective with sound body, sound mind or a sound decision.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,040
Or sometimes some people even say, I think in Ireland, they say, oh, he's a really sound

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
guy.

70
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Oh, so he's a good guy.

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
He's a good guy.

72
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Very interesting.

73
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Yeah.

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,800
So sound body, sound mind, sound guy.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Moving on, he was talking about the will and he says, I hereby revoke all previous wills

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
and codicils.

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,120
The verb here is to revoke.

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
To revoke.

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,000
This is something that a lot of people hear in America when they drive their car too fast.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,240
The police catch them and the police revoke their driver's license.

81
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,480
And that basically means to take away.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
That's right.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,840
Or to take, right?

84
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
To take away from.

85
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,720
So this man here, Luke Thompson, what he's saying is, I revoke all previous wills.

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,440
That means any other will that I wrote before, it's not good anymore.

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm throwing it away.

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,400
This is the only one that will exist.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,160
So you can use this word revoke with many aspects.

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,520
For example, sometimes employees will get their benefits revoked by the company because

91
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
maybe they don't have enough money anymore.

92
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,800
Or maybe they're bad employees.

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Or maybe they were bad employees.

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
That's too bad.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
All right.

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
So to revoke.

97
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,520
Now, moving on, he was talking about his estate.

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,600
So this is very interesting because he says, I give all the rest and residue of my estate

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,880
to my spouse.

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Okay, estate, it sounds like a very fancy word.

101
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,680
It is a fancy word.

102
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Sometimes we use this word to mean someone's property, their house.

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,240
But in a will, this means everything the person owns.

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,040
House, car, things, pets, stocks, investments.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,680
The estate is essentially everything the person owns as a kind of one unit.

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,160
Right, exactly.

107
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,280
So anything that is yours or you may have bought.

108
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,960
Let's consider the estate is a big bag, right?

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
That's your estate.

110
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,480
And inside this bag is everything that you own.

111
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,760
You might see advertisements in fact in America or in England for estate sales.

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,200
This means that when someone passes away, when they die, their family will sell their

113
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,360
things and this is an estate sale.

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
You can find beautiful, interesting things in estate sales.

115
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Exactly.

116
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Very interesting.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,860
So that is a person's estate.

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,760
Now remember this is in the legal terms because you also have other things like real estate.

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,480
And as you mentioned, which would be a house, right?

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,720
Okay, now apart from his estate, he was telling everyone as to how they should take care of

121
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,360
his body or what they should do with it.

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
And he said, well, I am to be cremated.

123
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,560
Okay, this is important.

124
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,440
When a person dies, there are generally two options.

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,680
Their body can be buried in a casket in the ground.

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,320
That means they're put in the earth.

127
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,800
But a lot of people choose to be cremated.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Okay, that means that their body will be burned and their ashes, that means the things that

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,680
are left after they are burned, they will be taken somewhere else.

130
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,280
Like in a bowl or a pot.

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
And in this case, that's what the person wants.

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
He wants to be cremated.

133
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,040
So that would be the verb to cremate and the noun would be a cremation.

134
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,600
And what is going to happen to all this stuff?

135
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,280
Basically it's going to be given away to his wife, to English Pod, and to his heirs.

136
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,080
This is our next word.

137
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
What is an heir?

138
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,320
Now, if you notice, the H is silent there.

139
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
So his heirs.

140
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,040
And those are basically his children.

141
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,280
His daughters or his sons.

142
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,720
Right, my heirs are the people who are related to me, who in this case will receive some

143
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
of my things.

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,600
Now, is it only the children or also it could be maybe any other relative?

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,760
It could be any other relative.

146
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,040
You could say, I'm his heir, he's my great uncle.

147
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,240
It means we're related but we're not necessarily father and daughter or grandfather and granddaughter.

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,000
An heir is someone who is related to the family.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,160
It doesn't have to be a certain relationship.

150
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,520
And now it's interesting because from this word we can get inheritance.

151
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,680
Now we didn't find it in the dialogue.

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,640
So it's very interesting because they're very similar in spelling, right?

153
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Inheritance and heir.

154
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Right, good to remember.

155
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,360
Yeah, good to remember.

156
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,840
You switch the E and the I's, right?

157
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
That's right.

158
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,040
So inheritance is a thing.

159
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,720
You can receive this.

160
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,680
So I received an inheritance from my great grandmother.

161
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,960
That means I received some money or some things.

162
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,920
That means you were that person's heir.

163
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
That's right.

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Okay.

165
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Or in his inheritance, he received a large house.

166
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,880
He was the heir to a great fortune.

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,400
Okay, interesting.

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,880
So again, inheritance wasn't in the dialogue but I think it's worth mentioning.

169
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,120
And I think now we can move on to four very interesting items that we have for you on

170
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
Fluency Builder.

171
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,760
Okay, these first two are words that we normally read or hear in legal documents.

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,520
And I want to place emphasis on the fact that we don't really say them in spoken English.

173
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,520
So remember that these are more formal terms.

174
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,440
The first one is hereby.

175
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,120
I hereby declare.

176
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,280
That means now.

177
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,800
With this word, with this spoken sentence, this will happen.

178
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,160
I think we've seen it like in movies sometimes.

179
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,800
I hereby declare this country in the name of England.

180
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,320
I hereby declare you man and wife.

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Exactly.

182
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay.

183
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,280
That means in this moment, this happens.

184
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Okay.

185
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,600
And a very similar word that we also saw in the dialogue is herewith.

186
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,680
So in the Will and Testament, we hear Luke Thompson who says, I herewith affix my signature.

187
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:40,600
That means with the action of signing my name, signing my signature, this will be completed.

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,880
So I herewith, you have to have an action, not just a word.

189
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Okay.

190
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,600
So I herewith.

191
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,960
I herewith attach my seal.

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,160
A seal is like a stamp.

193
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,000
Very common in the old days when you had real letters.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,880
But I herewith attach my seal and give my approval to this document.

195
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Okay.

196
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,200
So it has to be something physical.

197
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Yeah.

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Right.

199
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
So if maybe you're writing like this very classic letter and you say, I herewith include

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
a lock of my hair.

201
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Oh, how romantic.

202
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Okay.

203
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
That's kind of creepy.

204
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,880
But you're including or attaching physically, right?

205
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,160
I guess the modern version of herewith would be attach.

206
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Yeah.

207
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Okay.

208
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Good.

209
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Herewith, hereby.

210
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,160
We've got another phrase here that you might hear more commonly.

211
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,360
The beginning of the Will and Testament, there's a phrase as follows.

212
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,520
Okay.

213
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,400
I direct that the disposition of my remains be as follows.

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,800
So with my body do as follows.

215
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:49,160
So basically this is a very common way of putting this in a sentence to indicate that

216
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,840
you're going to start to list items.

217
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
That's right.

218
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Or give instructions.

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Give instructions.

220
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,760
So for example, to make a loaf of bread, do as follows.

221
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,080
Number one, get some flour.

222
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,640
Number two, add some water.

223
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,600
So this is a way for us to say, listen, I'm going to give you instructions or a list.

224
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Pay attention.

225
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,300
So please do as follows.

226
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,840
Please act as follows.

227
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Okay.

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Very good.

229
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,920
And our last word that we have here, going back to herewith, he said, I herewith affix

230
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
my signature.

231
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,520
What does it mean when you affix?

232
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Okay.

233
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,840
Affix is a word we have a number of other words for these days, so you rarely hear it.

234
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,280
It means to attach or to include.

235
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Okay.

236
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,320
So I herewith affix my signature would be attach my signature.

237
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Right.

238
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,920
I herewith provide my signature or I herewith affix my address or I herewith affix something.

239
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Okay.

240
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Very good.

241
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,320
Really interesting stuff.

242
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,640
You'll obviously see this very commonly with legal documents such as these, even though

243
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,360
it is like older English, it's still very commonly used.

244
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,320
I guess because the law is so old.

245
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
That's right.

246
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Definitely.

247
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,960
And I think that it's worth listening to today's monologue one more time.

248
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:15,560
Think about some of the words that we've just discussed and we'll be back in a moment.

249
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,400
Last will and testament of Luke Thompson.

250
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,800
I Luke Thompson residing in California, being of sound mind do hereby declare this instrument

251
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,120
to be my last will and testament.

252
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
I hereby revoke all previous wills and codicils.

253
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,080
I direct that the disposition of my remains be as follows.

254
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm to be cremated and taken to the summit of Mount Everest where my ashes will forever

255
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,480
remain at the ceiling of the earth.

256
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,400
I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my spouse, Betty Thompson, should she survive

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,800
me for 60 days.

258
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,840
If my spouse, Betty Thompson, does not survive me, I give all the rest and residue of my

259
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,480
estate to English Pod.

260
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,960
If neither Betty Thompson nor English Pod survives me, I give all the rest and residue

261
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,280
of my estate to my heirs as determined by the laws of the state of California relating

262
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,640
to descent and distribution.

263
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,560
I appoint Robert Porter to act as the executor of this will, to serve without bond.

264
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,800
Should Robert Porter be unable or unwilling to serve, then I appoint Jason Smalls to act

265
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,040
as the executor of this will.

266
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,560
I herewith affix my signature to this will on this the 23rd of May, 2010 in the presence

267
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,800
of the following witnesses who witnessed and subscribed this will at my request and in

268
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
my presence.

269
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,840
Alright, we're back.

270
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,760
So this is a very interesting topic.

271
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,120
Now I wonder, within the will or within the estate, do you also acquire a person's debts?

272
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Ah, that's a good question.

273
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,680
Because I know in some countries you do, in some countries you don't.

274
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,760
I know in like some cases, some heirs have found themselves in some legal problems because

275
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,800
all of a sudden they inherited that person's debts and stuff like that.

276
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,480
I think that does happen, especially for people whose properties are mortgaged.

277
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,840
For example, if your uncle has a house and he didn't pay for it with cash, he has a mortgage

278
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,560
and he dies and you inherit this house, you also inherit the mortgage.

279
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,120
So sometimes inheritances are not always a good thing.

280
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,580
I think this happened more in the past.

281
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,200
There are more protections and safeguards for people today.

282
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,560
But definitely, I mean, what is it like in Ecuador?

283
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,360
Do people inherit debt?

284
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:50,120
Yeah, I think most, well, obviously most banks when they give out loans or a mortgage, they

285
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,400
have somebody that will kind of co-sign on these things.

286
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,320
And I imagine, I'm not really very sure, but I know that if you inherit an estate that

287
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,760
has a mortgage, you are forced to pay it.

288
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,320
And if you can't, then they will make that other person who co-signed it responsible

289
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,600
if he still exists.

290
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't know.

291
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,960
In these legal systems, it's sometimes very strange because it seems like there would

292
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
be a lot of gaps.

293
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
That's right.

294
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,600
And everyone wants to protect themselves.

295
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,280
So we've got the bank that wants to protect itself.

296
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,560
It gives a loan, it wants the money back.

297
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:28,360
And a person who wants to protect himself from maybe a relative who dies and has debt.

298
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,380
So I'm curious to know what our users have to say.

299
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,240
What is the situation in your country?

300
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,960
Do most people have a will and testament?

301
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,280
What happens with debt?

302
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,040
Or what happens if somebody dies and they don't have a will and testament?

303
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,320
That's a good question too.

304
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,040
I don't have an answer for that one.

305
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,640
Alright, so let us know and we'll give you guys some information on that as well.

306

307
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
We'll see everyone there.

308
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Bye everyone.
