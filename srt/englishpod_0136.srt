00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,320
Hello everyone.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,040
And today we've got a great lesson for you at the upper intermediate level.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,600
We're going to be talking about an interesting topic which is gambling.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,880
Yeah, I don't know if you like to do this, Marco.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,840
Go, you know, play some cards, play some poker, blackjack, throw the dice.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm actually a bit of a fan of the roulette.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,280
You have to throw the ball onto the wheel that's spinning and it lands into like a

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,280
little compartment in a number.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Right.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,320
So you can win like based on the number and the color.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,720
But it's interesting because if you get the number right, it pays you 35 times your bet.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,960
Wow, that's a lot of money to win.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,840
A lot of potential there, but there's a lot of numbers on that wheel.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
But that's the thing.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,240
Some people like gambling, some people don't like it.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,800
And in some countries, in some states, it's illegal, right?

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Exactly.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,960
So today we're talking about a city that's looking to legalize this sport.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,600
So we're going to take a listen.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,480
Here at One Time, when we come back, we're talking all about what's going on in today's

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:16,160
lesson.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Did you hear?

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,080
The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Soon we're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which will be good for business.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,340
Are you serious?

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,240
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,600
human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
It disgusts me.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,920
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,960
How does it exploit people?

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,320
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,280
It ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,820
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,000
People have lost their houses, cars and have been left out on the street after becoming

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
addicted.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,760
and risk.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,040
Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,080
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,120
Geez, now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,760
Although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,120
You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling.

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize.

47
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,680
All right, so a very strong opinions against gambling, right?

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Absolutely.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,200
So we've got someone who hasn't really thought it through and another person who has thought

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,960
way too much about what's going on.

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Right.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,160
And well, he did point out some very interesting arguments against gambling.

53
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,200
And so we're going to take a look at some of the language that person used today in

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Language Takeaway.

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,440
Well, this first one we've got here is a word that has to do with the topic of today's lesson.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
So legalizing gambling.

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
What does it mean to legalize?

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Right.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,440
So to legalize, to make it legal.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,680
So legal is the word that refers to law.

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,200
And so that means to make something okay.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,560
It means to allow something in a state or country.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Exactly.

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,600
In many countries, it's illegal to gamble.

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,160
So in this case, the city is looking to legalize it to make it legal.

67
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
All right.

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,720
So many young people in America would like to see this law changed.

69
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,360
You're not allowed to drink until you're 21 years old, drink alcohol that is.

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
So they would like to see the legalization of underage drinking.

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,600
Now is it 21 in all states or in the majority?

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Yes, all states.

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Really?

74
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I thought it was only in some of them.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,760
No, it changed in the late 70s, I think.

76
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,600
But you absolutely cannot drink until you're 21.

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Wow.

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
What do you think?

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,840
Is that okay or is that?

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,580
I think that it encourages young people to drink irresponsibly.

81
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,220
And so I believe we should legalize drinking at the age of 18 because it would make people

82
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,560
learn how to be more responsible.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Right.

84
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Interesting.

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
All right.

86
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
So we want to legalize underage drinking.

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
English fun.

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
All right.

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,640
No, let's not manipulate my words.

90
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,920
This next word is very, very important.

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,080
He's saying that gambling or the gambling industry exploits people.

92
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,360
Okay, exploit.

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,800
You might have heard this in the news before.

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,240
We talk about often in the news, the exploitation of people.

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,160
But in this case, we're talking about exploiting people through money and gambling.

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Right.

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
So to exploit basically is to take advantage of them.

98
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,080
To use them for something.

99
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Not to treat them as people, but to use them as a way to get something.

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
All right.

101
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,960
And we often hear about it, as you say, in news about, you know, factories or companies

102
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,880
exploiting their employees or something of the sort.

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,600
We can also exploit the earth for its resources by taking oil and taking diamonds and taking

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
gold.

105
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Okay.

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
So to take advantage of.

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Interesting.

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,920
So to exploit is the verb, but exploitation is the noun.

109
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
All right.

110
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
That's the thing.

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,920
So we talk about the exploitation of people in this country or the exploitation of the

112
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
earth.

113
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,040
And they're talking about how gambling exploits people and how it's a vice.

114
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,480
Ooh, vices.

115
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,200
So for those of you Christians out there, you might be very familiar with the sins,

116
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
right?

117
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
The seven deadly sins.

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,280
Well, these are all vices, things that you do that are bad.

119
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,920
So drinking too much is a vice.

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Right.

121
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Or eating too much, right?

122
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Right.

123
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Or spending money without having money may be a vice for you.

124
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,520
So addictions are also a type of vice, right?

125
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,720
Like drinking, smoking, or drug abuse.

126
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Exactly.

127
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
These are all vices.

128
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
So vice is a bad thing.

129
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
Now, we may remember this show, popular American show called Miami Vice.

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
So what is that?

131
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Ooh, well, Miami Vice, it's in the city of Miami and it's about police officers.

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
So in the police, there's sometimes a group called the vice squad.

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
These are people who go out and try and stop people who are doing things that are vices.

134
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,920
Like drugs and gambling and stuff like that.

135
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah, exactly.

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Vice squad.

137
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Interesting.

138
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
All right.

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,760
So in the language takeover, we have this interesting word, a bookie.

140
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
All right.

141
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,920
So if any of you like to go to the horse races, you might be familiar with this one.

142
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,000
A bookie is someone who helps you make a bet.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,840
It's his job to help you make a bet.

144
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,480
So we often see it in movies.

145
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,600
Maybe you are betting on a sports competition, right?

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,320
And you are betting, I don't know, $10 against this team.

147
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,920
So you would go to a bookie to place your bet because there's not really any legal place

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
where you can do it.

149
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Exactly.

150
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,760
So you want to say, okay, tonight the Chicago Bulls are playing the Suns and you want to

151
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,200
put $100 on the Chicago Bulls.

152
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
That means they're going to win.

153
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,920
So you use a bookie and he helps you put the money down.

154
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,560
Now usually this is illegal, right?

155
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Generally it's illegal.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah.

157
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
It depends.

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,440
I guess you can go to a bookie at the horse races and it's illegal.

159
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,920
But generally it's illegal, I think.

160
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Okay.

161
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,360
So a sports bookie, we would say a sports bookie, right?

162
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Yeah.

163
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Interesting words.

164
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,800
So they're just related to, as we said, addictions and vices, but that's, I guess, kind of what

165
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
the whole gambling industry involves, right?

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Absolutely.

167
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
All right.

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,080
So now that we've seen those great words on Language Takeaway, let's move on now to Fluency

169
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,960
Builder.

170
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Fluency Builder.

171
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Okay.

172
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,320
Fluency Builder is where we get into some of this really exciting stuff, stuff where

173
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,360
we hear some opinions from a person who is not very happy with the gambling industry.

174
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,880
So this first one, gambling is an industry built on deception.

175
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Okay.

176
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's built on deception.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,880
So well, it's an industry, so it's not really tangible.

178
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Right.

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,000
So this is a metaphor.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,040
It's like saying that this industry is dependent on something.

181
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
And what is it dependent on?

182
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Deception.

183
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Deception.

184
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
So what's deception?

185
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
So to deceive, right?

186
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,840
That comes from the verb deceive, which basically says like a false appearance, right?

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,440
Not really being completely truthful.

188
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Okay.

189
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
This is really good.

190
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,720
So a lot of movies that we like to watch or theater is based on deception in a good way

191
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,520
because you get the idea that something is a certain way, but it really isn't in real

192
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
life.

193
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,920
So deception is in the theater, maybe a good thing, but in general, deception is a bad

194
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
thing.

195
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,680
I could say, Marco, I'm sorry I deceived you.

196
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
You lied to me.

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I lied to you.

198
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Yeah.

199
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,600
So deception usually involves lies or trying to make something seem like something that

200
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
it's not.

201
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Right.

202
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Okay.

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,640
So it's this industry is built on deception.

204
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,120
And he said that the sole purpose of this industry is to make money.

205
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Exactly.

206
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,400
So this, this phrase sole purpose is very, very common.

207
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
You hear this a lot.

208
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Soul, like the soul, like your human soul, like your human soul is spelled differently.

209
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
S O L E.

210
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,560
So you're talking about the one thing.

211
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
One and only.

212
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Yep.

213
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,680
I only have one love.

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
I only have one love, my sole pair of shoes.

215
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,720
I only have one pair of shoes.

216
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,400
So it's one thing, but the sole purpose.

217
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,200
So the only reason that this industry exists is what?

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,560
For monetary gain.

219
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,360
So monetary, you might have heard of the international monetary fund.

220
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Exactly.

221
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
The IMF.

222
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
And so monetary refers to money.

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Money.

224
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,440
As the door said, it's a gas.

225
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,360
And the gain, which means basically means making it to get more money.

226
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,120
So that's the point that this person is making that, that the sole purpose of the gambling

227
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
industry is to make money.

228
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Ouch.

229
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,800
So he's saying there's no other reason to gamble.

230
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
People are in this industry just to make money.

231
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
It's greedy.

232
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,640
Well, I mean, basically you could probably say that almost about almost all the companies,

233
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
right?

234
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
What about education companies like ours?

235
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
That's different.

236
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Education is very different.

237
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Absolutely.

238
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,720
So what's another industry that has a sole purpose?

239
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,400
For example, nonprofit organizations, their sole purpose is to help people.

240
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
All right.

241
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Okay.

242
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I can get into that.

243
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah.

244
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Cool.

245
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
So sole purpose and monetary gain.

246
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Very useful phrases.

247
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,480
But let's take another listen to today's dialogue and put to you some of these great,

248
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,320
great new words.

249
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Did you hear?

250
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,160
The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city.

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,560
Soon we're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which will be good for business.

252
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,480
Are you serious?

253
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of

254
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,720
human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

255
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
It disgusts me.

256
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,120
What are you talking about?

257
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
How does it exploit people?

258
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,480
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

259
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,440
It ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities.

260
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,960
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,040
People have lost their houses, cars and have been left on the street after becoming addicted.

262
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,580
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling, most often because of the action

263
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,080
and risk.

264
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,360
Women gamble to escape and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

265
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,440
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

266
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Geez, now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea.

267
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,960
Although I have been to Las Vegas and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

268
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,320
You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling.

269
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize.

270
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, so gambling, what are you, what are your opinions about it?

271
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,120
Pro gambling or anti gambling?

272
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,020
OK, well, here's the thing.

273
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:58,080
Gambling is a sport and it involves money, obviously, but people also don't, I don't

274
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,560
think should have other people telling them how to spend their money unless they have

275
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
some kind of problem.

276
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Right?

277
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,320
So the law doesn't get involved if you have a drinking problem until you're harmful to

278
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
people around you.

279
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,220
So I don't think that it's right for the for the government to be able to say, listen,

280
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,200
you can't gamble because it's your own money.

281
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
If it makes you happy, it makes you happy.

282
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Interesting.

283
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,360
Now we've seen very specific cities or places where you can actually gamble in this way.

284
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,720
You have Monaco or Las Vegas or Macau more recently.

285
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Right?

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,960
So very interesting cities or countries that have been built on the gambling industry,

287
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,600
which apparently is a multi-billion dollar industry.

288
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Absolutely.

289
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I don't know.

290
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
What do you think?

291
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Are you against gambling?

292
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,040
Are you for gambling?

293
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,320
I mean, is it one of those things that you can really...

294
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,760
Or do you maybe even like it?

295
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,520
Maybe some people don't even really care for it.

296
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,040
They don't find it fun to play blackjack or go to the play a round of poker or something

297
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
like that.

298
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Yeah, well, that's their problem.

299
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
I enjoy it.

300
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
I think it's fun.

301
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,480
I mean, as long as with anything, you do it in moderation.

302
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,760
That means you don't do it too much.

303
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
I think it's okay.

304
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
All right.

305
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,240
So listeners come to our website, EnglishPod.com to the comment section where you can tell

right?

310
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,760
It can be kind of a big issue to talk about because some people are really against it

311
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
and some people are really for it.

312
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
