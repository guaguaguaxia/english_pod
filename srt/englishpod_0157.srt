00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Hello everyone and welcome back to another lesson at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,920
And my name is Kathryn and in the spirit of Halloween, we have a Halloween lesson for

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
you.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
Happy Halloween.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
It's Halloween.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,360
It's Halloween and this is an elementary level lesson so we're talking about some basic but

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,280
important things today.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Exactly.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,960
So, we're not going to preview anything because the dialogue is pretty simple.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:41,560
So why don't we listen to it for the first time and we'll be right back.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Trick or treat.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,720
Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick or treating?

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,280
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,040
Where's your Halloween spirit?

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,260
Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick or treating

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,260
with your friends?

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,480
Of course I did.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,440
When I was 10, trick or treating is for kids plus I'm sure people think you're a kidnapper

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
or something running around with kids at night.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Whatever.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm going next door.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,800
I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags of M&Ms.

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,720
Alright, we're back.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,800
So trick or treating.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Ding dong.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Ding dong.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Trick or treat.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,520
So, we're going to explain what trick or treating is just in a little bit.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
But before we get into it, why don't we take a look at four important words in Language

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,800
Takeaway.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,040
Well, the first one, Marco, is very important because it's the name of this special holiday

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,240
that isn't celebrated everywhere.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
It's only celebrated in some places and Americans, I think, love it above all else.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Right.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Yeah, Halloween.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
And this actually comes from All Hallows Eve, right?

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
That's right.

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,920
So it's the night of the spirits of the dead.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Right, exactly.

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,960
So the day of the dead.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,920
And as Catherine mentions, it's celebrated in different ways in different countries but

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,960
I think probably the United States is one of the few where people dress up and go trick

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
or treating.

46
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
That's right.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,880
And Halloween is the last day of October.

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,360
So October 31st.

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,840
And it's a really fun holiday where mostly children dress up in costumes and they ask

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
for candy.

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
All right.

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,400
So to dress up means to get in a costume?

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Right.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Well, you could say dress up to mean a couple of different things but in this case, you

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,000
dress up in a costume.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,440
So that means you change your clothes so that you're wearing a costume which is maybe a

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,000
witch's costume or a vampire or something scary.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,660
So you would say, he dressed up as a vampire.

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,920
He dressed up as a vampire or they got dressed up for the wedding.

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
OK.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Very good.

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
So dress up.

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
And then we have the word kidnapper.

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,640
So the friend is afraid that his friend will look like a kidnapper if he goes out trick

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
or treating with the kids.

66
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
And so a kidnapper comes from the word to take or to grab.

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,780
So kid grabber.

68
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,000
And that means that you're going to take children from the streets and steal them.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Right.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
But you can kidnap an adult, right?

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,560
So it's not only for kids.

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
That's right.

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,100
It's for any kind of person who you take without them wanting you to.

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,960
So against their will.

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
OK.

76
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Kidnapper.

77
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
And finally, we have M&Ms.

78
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
What are M&Ms?

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Not the singer, right?

80
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
M&Ms.

81
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
No.

82
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
M&Ms is spelled differently, the singer.

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
This is a delicious chocolate treat.

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,700
It's a candy.

85
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
And it comes in big brown bags.

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,960
And if you want them with peanuts, they come in a yellow bag.

87
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
You know your M&Ms.

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,100
Oh man, I could tell you all the colors.

89
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,280
But M&Ms are really delicious.

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,240
And it's actually a brand, M&Ms.

91
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
It's a brand.

92
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Right.

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
So many people probably know it.

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,340
But just in case, they're called M&Ms.

95
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Very good candy.

96
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
All right.

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,280
So these words were relatively easy and simple.

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's slow it down just a little bit.

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,080
And we'll be right back to take a look at Fluency Builder.

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Fluency Builder.

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
All right.

103
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
We're back.

104
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,520
So on Fluency Builder, we promised that we were going to look at this word trick-or-treating.

105
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,200
So let's look at it now.

106
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,400
Trick-or-treat.

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
It's a verb, right?

108
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
To trick-or-treat.

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,760
To trick-or-treat.

110
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,880
And it comes from the words that we say when we're children to the person whose door we

111
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
knock on.

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,680
So for example, I say...

113
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,720
And then I open the door.

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
I say trick-or-treat.

115
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Okay.

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,280
So what are you supposed to do in this when somebody says trick-or-treat?

117
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,640
Well, I'm a child.

118
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
I'm holding my bag.

119
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,320
And you're supposed to say, happy Halloween and give me some candy.

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Okay.

121
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
All right.

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,600
So trick-or-treat means you could either trick someone.

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,380
You could play a trick on them like scare them or put some toilet paper on their house.

124
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,600
Or you can give them a treat.

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Or accept a treat.

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
And so the idea is if you don't give me a treat, I will do something bad to you.

127
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I see.

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
But this doesn't really happen, right?

129
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,480
Like when kids go to people's houses, they say trick-or-treat and then they get candy

130
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
automatically.

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,960
Almost automatically, yeah.

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
Sometimes people avoid the holiday and they close their doors and lock them and they don't

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
answer the door.

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,640
And that's when someone maybe throws an egg at the house or does something mean...

135
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,680
Or puts toilet paper on their tree.

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Yeah.

137
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,360
So trick-or-treat is what we say, but it's also something we can do.

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,760
So we can go trick-or-treating.

139
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Go trick-or-treating.

140
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Right.

141
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Okay.

142
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Very good.

143
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Very good.

144
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,160
And now we have another phrase here that's a little bit complicated.

145
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
But when the friend answered the door, he said, aren't you a little too old to be trick-or-treating?

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
All right.

147
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,240
I like this phrase because it's sarcastic.

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,760
The person is not asking a real question.

149
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,680
He's saying, listen, you are too old to be trick-or-treating.

150
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,560
And so in this case, aren't you... is a way to introduce something that we know is true,

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,280
that we think is true.

152
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
It's kind of rude and sarcastic.

153
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,920
So if I say, aren't you supposed to be at work?

154
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Oh, shoot.

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
So it's in that form.

156
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,720
You're not really asking a question.

157
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,400
You're more demanding an explanation.

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Right.

159
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
It's a suggestion.

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,040
It's like, you're probably supposed to be at work right now.

161
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,920
So Marco, aren't you supposed to be at school right now?

162
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,200
So do we always... but we always use it in that sense, right?

163
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,720
Aren't you... and then...

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Yeah.

165
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Aren't you...

166
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,040
Aren't you a little old for that kind of an outfit?

167
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
All right.

168
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
So aren't you...

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
All right.

170
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Very good.

171
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
So those are the two phrases for fluency builder today.

172
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:57,120
Let's listen quickly to our dialogue one more time and we'll be right back.

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Trick-or-treat.

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick-or-treating?

175
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
What are you talking about?

176
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,440
Where's your Halloween spirit?

177
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,640
Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating

178
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
with your friends?

179
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
Of course I did.

180
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,800
But when I was 10, trick-or-treating is for kids.

181
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Plus, I'm sure people think you're a kidnapper or something, running around with kids at

182
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
night.

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Whatever.

184
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm going next door.

185
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,360
I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags of M&Ms.

186
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,160
All right.

187
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:33,320
So, Marco, have you ever trick-or-treated?

188
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I did.

189
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
I did.

190
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,560
I used to go trick-or-treating when I was little and it was actually really fun.

191
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,440
We used to have competitions about who had the most candy.

192
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I've heard about this.

193
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Right?

194
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,520
Because you don't necessarily bring a bag.

195
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
You bring a pillowcase.

196
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Right.

197
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,560
And you fill your pillowcase with candy.

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,400
Now, the interesting thing is that sometimes you wouldn't necessarily only get candy from

199
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
people.

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Right.

201
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,280
Sometimes you got weird things like pennies or toothbrushes or apples.

202
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Yeah.

203
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
So you would go to someone's house and they would give you an apple.

204
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
You'd be like, okay.

205
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,080
But there was always an old lady who lived near, well, she lived in the neighborhood

206
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,400
and every neighborhood had one.

207
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,800
All my friends had a lady they would go to and she gave the full-size candy bars.

208
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Wow.

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Right?

210
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,400
Because normally stores sell small candy bars for the Halloween holiday because they're

211
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,720
smaller, they're cheaper, it's easier to give them to many people.

212
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,800
But there's always one person who has the big full-size candy bars and everyone goes

213
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
to her.

214
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Right.

215
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Exactly.

216
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,620
And actually it's amazing how Halloween is such an important event in the States because

217
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,760
everyone dresses up, everyone puts out decorations or pumpkins outside of their homes.

218
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,880
They have pumpkin carving contests which are really cool how they carve out pumpkins.

219
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,480
They make faces in the pumpkins and then we can put a candle inside to light it up.

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
It's really fun.

221
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,120
So that's called a jack-o'-lantern, right?

222
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
That's right.

223
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Why is it called a jack-o'-lantern?

224
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Do you know?

225
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
I have no idea.

226
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
It's weird.

227
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Maybe it's like a person looks like a person's face.

228
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Maybe a jack-o'-lantern.

229
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
Because a lantern is a light.

230
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,680
It's like a light with a candle in it.

231
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,880
It's actually a very fun holiday.

232
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,800
It's really interesting and it's kind of strange when people really oppose it because they

233
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,800
say that it has to do with the devil or it has to do...

234
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,840
It's a pagan ritual and things like this.

235
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
But you know, it's just good fun.

236
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
It's fun.

237
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
It's silly.

238
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Everyone likes to dress up in a costume.

239
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,080
What was the weirdest costume that you've dressed up as, as an adult or a child?

240
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,200
Because I know you've dressed up as an adult as well.

241
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I dress up every year.

242
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,280
I was Pippi Longstocking last year.

243
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,880
Well, as a child one year, I dressed up as an injured soldier because my dad was in the

244
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,640
military so we always had fatigues around the house.

245
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,840
And so I used his fatigues and I put blood on my face and I had crutches.

246
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,600
And people thought that I really had a broken leg.

247
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
So they used to give me double...

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,160
That year they gave me double the candy because they thought, oh, here's a poor girl in crutches.

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
And trick or treating.

250
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,200
And my costume was an injured soldier so they just didn't understand it.

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
It's really funny.

252
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Nice.

253
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,520
Well, we want to hear about you guys.

254
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,000

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,320

256
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
dress up.
