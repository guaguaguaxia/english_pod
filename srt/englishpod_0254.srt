00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,840
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we've got an elementary level lesson for you all about

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
getting up in the morning.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,020
Today we're making breakfast and well, of course, many people have different things

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,020
when they're making breakfast.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,200
Some of them are very big, others are small.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,520
So but this is what we're going to talk about today.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:31,920
So why don't we listen to the dialogue and see what they're having for breakfast today.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,680
Smells good.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
What's for breakfast?

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,200
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Nice.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Brunch.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Kind of.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,920
So I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some French toast and buttermilk pancakes.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,080
Wow, you really went all out.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,360
Did you make any coffee?

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,400
Yeah, just the way you like it.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,880
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Looks good.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,080
I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,040
Get the jam and butter while you are in there.

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,200
Oh, and don't forget the syrup.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,480
All righty.

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,680
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
So a lot of interesting things.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,560
A huge breakfast.

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
Way too big for me.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't like to eat a big breakfast because I feel like it makes me tired and then I don't

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
have any energy.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
Especially if you just get up, right?

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Exactly.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,160
You need to shower and maybe have some fruit and then go to work.

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,960
But we can talk about that at the end.

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,080
There were a lot of interesting words and phrases that we heard that we would benefit

38
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,640
from taking a closer look at.

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Language takeaway.

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,480
All right, so on Language Takeaway today, we're going to take a look at our first word

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,280
and it's an interesting word.

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
It's kind of a mix of two things.

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Brunch.

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
That's right.

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
So this word comes from two different words.

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
Breakfast, b-b-breakfast and lunch.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
That's right.

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,160
So brunch.

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,400
So if you have brunch, what is exactly brunch?

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Well there's two ways to look at brunch.

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,160
One is the time element.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,040
Usually brunch is later than breakfast, but maybe a little earlier than lunch.

53
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,140
So 11 o'clock or maybe even noon.

54
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,000
But the other thing is size.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,740
Because you're putting two meals together, usually brunch is very big.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,880
You eat a lot of food.

57
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,800
Okay, so it's a perfect combination of breakfast and lunch.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm the type of person that likes having scrambled eggs at noon.

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,560
So this is a perfect solution, brunch.

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,120
Right, you don't have to only eat eggs at breakfast, you can eat them at lunch as well.

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Exactly.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
This is actually something we do a lot in America for Mother's Day.

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,760
So mom wakes up late, we take her to brunch.

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,520
It's a very big special meal.

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Very good.

66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,960
And talking about eggs and the types of eggs that we can have, I mentioned scrambled eggs

67
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,960
and in the dialogue we also heard soft-boiled eggs.

68
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,360
Okay, these are two very important kinds of eggs.

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,400
Usually if you're in a restaurant, they will ask you how do you want your eggs cooked or

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
done.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,360
And my answer is always scrambled.

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,200
This means someone mixes the eggs before they are cooked and then when they cook, they are

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,120
hard, they're yellow.

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,240
There's no white, it's just yellow and it's a little hard mixture.

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,560
But soft-boiled eggs are very, very different.

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,560
That's right, soft-boiled eggs, you actually don't break the egg or open the egg to cook

77
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,120
it like in scrambled eggs.

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,440
You actually put the entire egg in boiling water.

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,960
I think it's for two minutes and then you take it out and then you open the shell and

80
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,880
the eggs are kind of cooked, it's kind of hard in some parts but it's also kind of liquidy

81
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,020
in other parts.

82
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
That's right.

83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,200
So the outside, the white part is hard but the yellow part, the yolk is liquid.

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
It's not hard.

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
That's right.

86
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,480
And actually if you want the whole egg to be hard, you can ask for hard-boiled eggs.

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,240
That's right, those are cooked for much longer.

88
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
That's right.

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,280
Okay, so we have scrambled eggs, soft-boiled eggs, we have French toast and we have buttermilk

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
pancakes.

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay, so you can ask for just pancakes.

92
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,200
But if you want to be specific, you want to give instructions about what kind of pancakes,

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,080
you can ask for buttermilk pancakes.

94
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,360
And what exactly is buttermilk?

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,480
Buttermilk is a very, very creamy, eggy milk that's very, very high in fat that makes everything

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,600
taste better, I think.

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,320
This is used a lot in baking, not really in other kinds of foods.

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,840
So you can have buttermilk muffins or buttermilk biscuits.

99
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,440
But usually you have buttermilk pancakes and so these are very rich, very fatty pancakes.

100
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,000
Awesome, yeah, they taste delicious.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,280
Alright, so now if we want to eat a little bit more healthy, we do have some cereal and

102
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
some muesli.

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,840
Muesli is a funny word, it's not a sound we make very often in English.

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Muesli.

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Yeah.

106
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
I think it actually comes from German.

107
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
It does look German.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,240
Because actually the spelling is M-U-E, so you would kind of want to say Muesli or something.

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Yeah, no, we say Muesli and it's basically a mixture of granola or different kinds of

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,880
fiber grains.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,320
So just think of having raisins and maybe some almonds, granola, all mixed up and you

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,040
have this nice thing that goes well with yogurt, muesli.

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,200
It's very, very tasty and also very good for you.

114
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,920
And now, well, actually going back to pancakes, no pancake is possible to eat unless you put

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,280
syrup on it, right?

116
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,520
Well, some people might disagree.

117
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,720
I know a lot of people who eat pancakes with honey or with butter.

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,040
But the best, I think, is with syrup.

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,680
And syrup is basically liquid sugar and you put it on your pancakes to make them sweeter.

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Actually, it's the same thing as honey basically, except that it doesn't come from bees.

121
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,720
Right, so real syrup, we say maple syrup, comes from maple trees and you tap the tree

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
and it comes out.

123
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
It's very, very, very sweet.

124
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,640
But we also have syrup you can buy at the store, which is man-made.

125
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Artificial.

126
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Yeah, it's basically just sugar.

127
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,940
Okay, very good.

128
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,000
So that's what we have with pancakes usually.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,760
But why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue again.

130
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,080
Let's review all of these yummy breakfast treats and we'll come back in a bit with Fluency

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,800
Builder.

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,520
Smells good.

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
What's for breakfast?

134
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,040
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

135
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,440
Nice, brunch.

136
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,960
Kind of.

137
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,760
So I made scrambled and soft-boiled eggs, some French toast, and buttermilk pancakes.

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,920
Wow, you really went all out.

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
Did you make any coffee?

140
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,240
Yeah, just the way you like it.

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,720
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

142
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Looks good.

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Get the jam and butter while you are in there.

145
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,800
Oh, and don't forget the syrup.

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Alrighty.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,600
All right, so now on Fluency Builder, why don't we take a look at a couple of phrases.

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Fluency Builder.

149
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,880
When the guy was kind of surprised, he said, wow, you really went all out.

150
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,080
Okay, so this comes from the phrase, to go all out.

151
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,800
So he went all out or I'm going to go all out.

152
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,960
And this means to give something your best, to do more than is expected.

153
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
That's right.

154
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,280
So if you go all out when you're making breakfast, it means you just, you cooked a lot or really

155
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,080
good and you spend a lot of time doing it.

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,640
Or for example, if it's someone's birthday and I know it's their birthday, I go all out

157
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,240
by buying gifts and a cake and lots of decorations and calling all of their friends and having

158
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
a party.

159
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,600
So this is doing everything for them.

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
That's right.

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Okay.

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,800
And he was really surprised and he really seemed to enjoy breakfast and he said, looks

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
good.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,080
Okay, this is a way to say good job or nicely done.

165
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
It's almost a way to say, I'm happy about this.

166
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,560
Or yeah, and obviously you can also say that the food looks delicious, so it looks good.

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
It looks good.

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,400
So it's a way to say, you know, well done, looks good or in this case, looks very tasty.

169
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
That's right.

170
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Okay.

171
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,440
And now this is an interesting part.

172
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,360
He says, I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

173
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,320
So let's take a look at this verb, squeeze.

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,660
To squeeze.

175
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,220
This is something you usually do with your hand when you tighten something.

176
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,480
So for example, your toothpaste.

177
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,200
Yes, you squeeze your toothpaste so the toothpaste will come out.

178
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,120
So in this case, we are squeezing the orange juice to extract the juice.

179
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
That's right.

180
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,560
So you, you hold the orange very tight, you make the juice come out and then you have

181
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
fresh squeezed orange juice.

182
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,840
And this is different from orange juice you buy in a store.

183
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Okay.

184
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,400
So you can say, I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

185
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,640
That means you're going to make fresh orange juice.

186
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,640
And this fresh orange juice that you make is called fresh squeezed orange juice.

187
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,760
Fresh squeezed.

188
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,680
You've probably seen this in the store, like some bottles, they say a hundred percent fresh

189
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,000
squeezed orange juice or something.

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah, it's good for advertising.

191
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,880
All right.

192
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
So very good.

193
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,760
A lot of great, interesting phrases there.

194
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,360
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time?

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,480
Smells good.

196
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
What's for breakfast?

197
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,880
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

198
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Nice brunch.

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Kind of.

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,680
So I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some French toast and buttermilk pancakes.

201
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Wow.

202
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
You really went all out.

203
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,120
Did you make any coffee?

204
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,220
Yeah, just the way you like it.

205
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,680
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

206
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Looks good.

207
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,880
I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

208
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Get the jam and butter while you are in there.

209
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,200
Oh, and don't forget the syrup.

210
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
All righty.

211
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,160
All right.

212
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,640
So talking about brunch and breakfast, what is your typical or ideal breakfast?

213
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,800
That's a hard question.

214
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.

215
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,320
So I could eat breakfast, all kinds of breakfast anytime.

216
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,640
But one of my favorite kinds of breakfast is a Greek diner breakfast.

217
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Greek diner.

218
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
What does this have?

219
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, we have a lot of diners or small restaurants that are very, very cheap and fast in America.

220
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:45,880
And this usually involves some scrambled eggs that are made with cheese and toast and potatoes

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,960
and bacon and sausage and a coffee.

222
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Wow.

223
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Big breakfast.

224
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Very big.

225
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
But delicious.

226
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Nice.

227
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
What's your favorite?

228
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,520
I also really, really like breakfast.

229
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,440
And I actually like having places that you can have 24-hour a day breakfast.

230
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
All day breakfast is called.

231
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
So I can have breakfast for dinner.

232
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Right.

233
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,480
That's usually in America, you go to a diner because they have breakfast at four o'clock

234
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,160
in the morning or at seven o'clock at night.

235
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm not really a coffee person.

236
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,560
I actually enjoy either juice, orange juice, or hot chocolate.

237
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,400
I really like hot chocolate.

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,800
And definitely pancakes.

239
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,240
Three buttermilk pancakes stacked.

240
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,120
And as you said before, syrup.

241
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
But I actually also put butter on it.

242
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Gross.

243
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I know a lot of people who do that.

244
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,880
They put butter on first and then they pour the syrup.

245
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,360
Yeah, of course.

246
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,160
So it's like complete, very, very fatty.

247
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
And hash browns.

248
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,360
I'm definitely a fan of hash browns.

249
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,840
Those are potatoes that are chopped very, very finely and you fry them together.

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,120
So it almost becomes like a potato pancake.

251
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,760
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
So a lot of great stuff.

253
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,680
And obviously, breakfasts around the world are different.

254
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,360
I know, for example, in some countries, they have the fisherman's breakfast.

255
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,960
So in the morning, you have black coffee, rice, and fish.

256
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
That's right.

257
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
Because you're going to work all day.

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,080
So we're really curious about how breakfast is in your country.

259
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,560
What a typical breakfast is like.

260
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,960
Yeah, what are traditional breakfasts and what is your favorite breakfast?

261
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,400
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

262
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
We hope to see you there.

263
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
All right.

264
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Bye.

265
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:28,440
I mean, we have good up-to-date advertising.
