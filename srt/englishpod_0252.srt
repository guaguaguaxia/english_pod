00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,160
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about something that's very common in high

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,120
schools all across the English speaking world.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
That's right.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,260
Today we are going to talk a little bit about sexual education or also called sex ed.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,520
So you may be asking yourself what exactly this means.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,160
So let's take a look at this word on Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,600
Okay, so more commonly than not we're going to hear the phrase sex ed, E-D.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,300
That stands for education.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,300
This is basically a class or a training about sexuality and safety when it comes to these

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,600
issues.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
That's right.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,160
So as you said, this is a very common class that is part of the school curriculum in English

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
speaking countries.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,720
I think maybe students are about 16 to 15, 16 years old when they get sex ed.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,200
We had it when I was about 13, 14.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
13, 14.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
So it all depends.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,480
Now many countries don't really have this in their public schools.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,880
Other countries only have it in private schools.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,280
So it's a very controversial topic about if schools should actually be teaching this.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,560
But we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,720
Why don't we take a look at today's dialogue.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,160
Let's listen to what's happening today.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:33,120
All right, settle down everyone.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,080
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex ed this week.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,040
Oh boy, yeah.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,000
Now I want everyone to take this class seriously.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,600
Sexual education is very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
of.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,480
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,440
Miss Carlton, what exactly is sexual education?

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,760
Are you going to teach us like Kama Sutra and stuff like that?

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,960
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex ed is.

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,860
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,820
and female bodies work.

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,640
My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,520
Good point, Jason.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,440
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy,

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,720
but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
Another popular method is using condoms.

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,080
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,440
getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Yes, Jason?

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
What are condoms made out of?

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,000
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,320
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Alright, we're back, so now I'm sure there are a couple of words that we didn't really

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,560
understand there, so let's take a look at a couple of them on Language Takeaway.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Language Takeaway

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,640
Okay, so one of the most common phrases you're going to hear when it comes to sex and safety

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,600
when you're having sex is sexually transmitted disease or STD.

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,560
That's right, so the teacher actually mentioned the whole name sexually transmitted diseases

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,120
and also she used the acronym STDs or STD in STD.

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,160
And what exactly are these STDs?

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,480
Well, the key word here is disease.

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,240
These are illnesses that you can get from sex.

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,480
So sexually transmitted means transmitted or passed on from one person to another person

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,360
during sex and this could include any kind of diseases like AIDS or syphilis or chlamydia

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
or gonorrhea.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
Those are the most famous ones.

67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,040
That's right, so sexually transmitted diseases.

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,800
Now why don't we get into the title of our lesson today, contraceptives.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,480
What are these contraceptives?

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Okay, so teachers are always going to explain the big difference between protection and

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,000
contraception or contraceptives.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Usually contraceptives have to do with getting pregnant.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,440
If you don't want your girlfriend to get pregnant and your guy or if your girl and you don't

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,840
want to get pregnant, you take contraceptives or you use contraceptives.

75
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,800
There are many different kinds and I think the most common kind for preventing pregnancy

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,680
or keep making sure you don't get pregnant is something called the pill.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,500
That's right, one of the kids said that his sister takes the pill.

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,480
Now this is called the pill.

79
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Now you know that pills are any type of a capsule or little medicine that you swallow

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,520
with water.

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,320
But what is the pill?

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
Well this is the birth control pill.

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
So that's a long name.

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
People often in conversation just say the pill.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,040
But it's called the birth control pill and it's a pill that women take every day or some

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,320
of them different times to prevent pregnancy.

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,560
So that means that you're trying not to get pregnant.

88
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
That's right.

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,320
Okay, so this is called a contraceptive.

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,600
Now as you mentioned, this is a contraceptive so it will prevent you from getting pregnant.

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,920
But it will not protect you and as many of you may know, the most common form of protection

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,200
against pregnancy and STDs are a little device called a condom.

93
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,520
Okay, so a condom is like you said the most common kind of protection that people use

94
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,280
and it's important because it helps you not only not get pregnant but also not get a disease.

95
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,160
And so people often talk about this as being the most important kind of protection from

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
disease and pregnancy.

97
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,560
And it's basically just a cover for a man's penis and it prevents liquids being passed

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,320
on from one person to another person.

99
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,520
That's right and actually as you mentioned, this has to do with our next word.

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
It prevents you from contracting STDs like the teacher mentioned.

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,480
So to contract an STD or to contract an illness, what does that mean?

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Well contract is a special verb that we use when we're talking about getting a disease.

103
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,720
You don't say I got a disease, you say I contracted it.

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,720
That means I got it from somewhere or someone.

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,040
And that's one of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,520
You can contract very serious diseases just by having sex.

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,400
Now can I say I contracted the flu?

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,960
I mean it's not incorrect but we don't really say that with the flu.

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
It's not a very serious illness.

110
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,440
You say it with very serious illnesses.

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,040
So yeah I don't think you would go around saying I contracted a cold last week.

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
I got the cold.

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
And you wouldn't say this about cancer either because cancer is not something you get from

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
someone else.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,440
But you say he contracted AIDS or he contracted gonorrhea for example.

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
Okay very good.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,480
So as you see the spelling is actually the same as a contract like an agreement between

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,380
a company or two people.

119
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,560
But the accent is different.

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,240
A contract is an agreement to contract that what we're talking about.

121
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Illnesses.

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
To get.

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
To get.

124
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Alright very good.

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,040
And for our final word, we're going back to condoms.

126
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,040
The material that they are made out of is called latex.

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay so latex is a very special kind of material that is like they say in the dialogue elastic.

128
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,400
It's stretchy.

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,240
And it's almost plasticky.

130
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,520
But it's very very tough.

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,000
It's very strong and that's why they make condoms out of it.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,600
And I think we also see things made out of latex for example doctors when they're operating

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,640
they wear latex gloves.

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
That's right.

135
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,480
Obviously they don't want to use materials that are weak or that are thin because they

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,840
need to protect their patients from germs.

137
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,560
And so latex gloves and latex condoms are very very common because they are so durable.

138
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
That's right.

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Okay.

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
So a lot of interesting stuff there.

141
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Why don't we now jump on over and take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency

142
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,680
Builder.

143
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Fluency Builder.

144
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,660
So this first phrase is something you should be very very familiar with if you've ever

145
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,960
been in a classroom in America or Canada.

146
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,560
Often times with younger children or with high school children people get really worked

147
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,680
up very excited.

148
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,080
You know kids are yelling and talking and they're giggling and they think that oh sex

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
is so funny.

150
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
And so the teacher always says settle down.

151
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Settle down.

152
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Okay.

153
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
So if somebody tells you to settle down.

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Hey settle down.

155
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Settle down.

156
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,840
That means calm down.

157
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Be quiet.

158
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
You're too excited.

159
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Calm down.

160
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,000
So you can use this with your kids maybe.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Settle down.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We need to go.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Come on.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Get in the car.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's right.

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So just kind of be quiet.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Be a little bit calmer.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,960
It's very very very important phrase especially if you're talking to younger people.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Okay.

170
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,840
And well of course when you're talking about sex with teenagers or younger people everyone's

171
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,600
laughing and giggling because it's such a weird thing for them.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,320
And the teacher said I really want you to take this class seriously.

173
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
Okay so take this class seriously.

174
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
This comes from a sentence structure that's very very important.

175
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
To take something seriously.

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,480
I take my studies very seriously.

177
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Or you guys should take this class seriously.

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
It's important.

179
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
It means listen.

180
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Pay attention.

181
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
This is important and you need to know this.

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,880
It's a way it's kind of a way to instruct someone to really pay attention.

183
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
That's right.

184
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,760
Or what if you say I want you to take me seriously.

185
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,800
That means I want you to really think about what I'm saying and not just talk to me like

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,600
a you know like I don't really understand what's going on.

187
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay.

188
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Very good.

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,960
So to take something seriously is the structure.

190
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,480
Now moving on to our final phrase.

191
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,320
When we were talking again about contraceptives we talked about avoiding pregnancy and we

192
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,240
have a phrase that we use called unwanted pregnancy.

193
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,520
Okay so pregnancy is what happens when someone gets pregnant.

194
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
They're going to have a baby.

195
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,080
But an unwanted pregnancy is a certain kind of pregnancy.

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,980
It means when someone did not plan to get pregnant or did not want to get pregnant.

197
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,560
So want unwanted is the opposite of wanted.

198
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,400
It means like it was an accident.

199
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Right.

200
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,000
So you wouldn't really say an accidental pregnancy because it you know.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,680
It's still a kid.

202
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Exactly.

203
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
So you didn't want to get pregnant but you did.

204
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,040
That's why we say unwanted pregnancy.

205
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Or you'll hear very often condoms help prevent unwanted pregnancy or the pill helps prevent

206
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,560
unwanted pregnancy.

207
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
That's right.

208
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,200
Okay so a lot of interesting stuff there.

209
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:59,600
I think it's worthwhile for us to listen to our dialogue for one last time.

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,880
All right settle down everyone.

211
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,040
As part of this school's curriculum we'll be covering sex ed this week.

212
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,800
Oh boy yeah.

213
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,760
Now I want everyone to take this class seriously.

214
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,360
Sexual education is very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think

215
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
of.

216
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Remember there are no stupid questions here.

217
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Miss Carlton what exactly is sexual education?

218
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,000
Are you going to teach us like Kama Sutra and stuff like that?

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,280
No Jason that's not actually what sex ed is.

220
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,640
Basically we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male

221
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
and female bodies work.

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,400
My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

223
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,680
I never really understood what that is but I know it has to do with sex or something.

224
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,300
Good point Jason.

225
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,800
This will be the topic of our first class contraceptives.

226
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,920
As you mentioned the pill is one of the many that exist.

227
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,760
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy

228
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,480
but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

229
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Another popular method is using condoms.

230
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,840
This is probably the best method if you have sex since it not only prevents a woman from

231
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,160
getting pregnant but also protects you from STDs.

232
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Yes Jason?

233
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,400
What are condoms made out of?

234
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,760
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

235
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

236
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:42,080
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.

237
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,120
Alright so coming back, we obviously didn't cover all forms of contraception and forms

238
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,240
of protecting yourself against STDs but I remember very clearly in school when we talked

239
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,640
about this, they said the best protection, the best way to not get pregnant or to get

240
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,480
STDs is celibacy.

241
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
That's right.

242
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
Celibacy is not having any sex.

243
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,460
When I was in school they said the safest sex is no sex because there's always a little

244
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,120
bit of danger.

245
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,360
And so this is something that I think they tell a lot of young people to scare them but

246
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,680
there is some truth to it.

247
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Yeah of course.

248
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Now what do you think about this topic?

249
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:26,400
Do you think it's worthwhile and we should teach children sexual education or many people

250
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,280
protest against it and say this is wrong, we shouldn't be giving kids condoms when they're

251
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
in high school?

252
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,920
Well personally I think that kids in most parts of the world will have sex whether or

253
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,800
not you tell them not to.

254
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,680
And so because of that, because everyone's going to, there are always going to be people

255
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,640
trying it, I think it's important to inform students and inform kids who are in high school

256
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,800
of options and of safety and of important health measures because otherwise you risk

257
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,860
unwanted pregnancies and you risk people getting these very serious diseases like AIDS.

258
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
That's right.

259
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,140
I think it is a very important topic.

260
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,560
Some countries or some places even within the United States are a little bit more conservative

261
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,360
than others and so many times they are against this type of education but I've actually encountered

262
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,880
people who never received sexual education and well until they were maybe like 18 they

263
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
thought they can get pregnant by a kiss.

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,560
So I think that's one of the dangers.

265
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Obviously there are both sides to this issue and we're curious to know what you think.

266
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,920
Do you think that sex ed should be a course or should be something that people talk about

267
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
in schools, in high school or in college?

268
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,840
Do they do this in your home country?

269
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Let us know.

270
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

271
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
All right.

272
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
We'll see you guys there.

273
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Bye.

274
00:14:42,840 --> 00:15:03,220
Another orientation of the
