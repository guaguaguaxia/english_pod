1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
And my name is Katrin.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,520
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,600
Today, we are taking a look at a guy who is a little bit too afraid of people in general.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,600
There's a good word for this in English, someone who's almost too afraid all the time, someone

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,760
who is overly cautious.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,240
We call this person paranoid.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,520
Okay, so if you are paranoid, you think that everyone wants to hurt you or that everyone

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
is out to get you.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Wait, did you hear that?

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
No, I didn't.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Did you hear that?

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Someone at the door.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Marco, can you check that?

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
Okay, that's paranoid.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,240
You know, you're always hearing voices and noises and things.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, so a paranoid, somebody that is paranoid.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,560
All right, so why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what this

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
person is all paranoid about.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
There he is again.

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:09,280
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,000
Is everything okay?

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,080
Just get over here.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,360
Come in, quickly.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
So since when is your house a bank?

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
What do you mean?

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,480
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,360
Security Dan, security.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
You can never be too safe, you know.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,040
A lot of sickos out there.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,680
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red handed, had a high power telescope

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,520
and binoculars by his window.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
What's the matter with you?

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Why are you acting all paranoid?

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Paranoid?

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm not paranoid.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm cautious.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,360
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,440
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank, they have way too much information.

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,120
Okay, well, what did you want to see me about?

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
You're being watched.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Be careful, Dan.

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
Be careful.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,400
All right, we're back.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,480
So, yeah, I think this guy is a little bit too cautious.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,200
I would have to agree with you and I would go so far as to call him paranoid.

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,720
But there's a lot of great stuff in this dialogue that we can use in a lot of different situations.

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,440
So let's take a look at some of these new words in today's language takeaway.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,640
Language takeaway.

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,200
All right, the first word on language takeaway today is sicko.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,480
Sicko is also the name of a movie that was a documentary famous in America by Michael

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Moore actually.

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,560
But a sicko in this context means someone who is a bit weird in a bad way.

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,160
So if you tell somebody you're sick, but like in that tone, right, you're saying you're

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,920
sick, you're a sick person.

59
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
You're gross.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Right.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
You're saying you're gross.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,760
So people who have inappropriate humor, who make jokes about not so nice things.

63
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Right.

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Yeah, they're sick.

65
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,560
But in this case, sickos are people who maybe like to hurt other people, people who are

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,760
a little bit crazy, people who are not normal.

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,840
So it's not a nice way of calling someone crazy, right?

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
If you say, oh, he's a sicko, it's not really nice.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Not at all.

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,520
It's a way of saying that you're almost scared of this person because they're kind of weird

71
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,600
and almost they have problems.

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
All right.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
So that's a sicko.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,800
Moving on to our next word.

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,400
We saw that the guy was afraid of telemarketers.

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Exactly.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
So what are these guys?

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,720
Well, we've got two words being put together here, tele and market.

79
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,760
So tele, like telephone, telephone, over communication.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
So they're not in person.

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
They're people who call you up and market things.

82
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,460
They try to sell you stuff over the phone.

83
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,520
So this is very common.

84
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,220
You get a phone call on your cell phone and they ask you if you're happy with your long

85
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,980
distance calling plan or if you need new TV cable or something like that.

86
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,840
And they always call during dinner or late at night, which drives me nuts.

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,080
So these are telemarketers.

88
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,140
These are people who call you trying to sell things to you.

89
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,320
And very similar to these is a solicitor.

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Exactly.

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,760
But the big difference here with solicitors and telemarketers is that solicitors actually

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
go to your house.

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,560
They knock on your door.

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,120
So they're also called door to door salesmen or saleswomen.

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
That's right.

96
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Door to door salesmen.

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,080
They go from door to door trying to sell things.

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,480
But in this case, a solicitor is someone who comes to your house to try to get you to do

99
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
something, to buy something.

100
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
All right.

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Very good.

102
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,440
And moving on to our next word, we have a peeping Tom.

103
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
That's right.

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
We heard this a little bit earlier in the dialogue.

105
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,480
And a peeping Tom is again a negative thing to say about someone.

106
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,960
A peeping Tom, well, the word peep means to look, but kind of like, yeah, it's a quick

107
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
look.

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,600
A peeping Tom is a person who spies on other people.

109
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Okay.

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,080
So a synonym of a peeping Tom would be a voyeur.

111
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
A voyeur.

112
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,360
So someone who, without getting caught, tries to look at other people while they're in their

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
homes.

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,200
And so it's really bad because it's usually inappropriate.

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,840
It's usually people who are watching women get undressed or...

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Right.

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,240
So a peeping Tom is just an informal way of saying a voyeur or somebody who is spying on

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
people.

119
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
So those are the words for today in Language Takeaway.

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,240
Let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll be right back.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:54,600
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Is everything okay?

123
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,060
Just get over here.

124
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,320
Come in, quickly.

125
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,720
So since when is your house a bank?

126
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
What do you mean?

127
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,000
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,480
Security, Dan!

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Security!

130
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
You can never be too safe, you know.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,040
A lot of sickos out there.

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,320
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red-handed.

133
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,520
Had a high-power telescope and binoculars by his window.

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,200
What's the matter with you?

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Why are you acting all paranoid?

136
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Paranoid?

137
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm not paranoid!

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm cautious!

139
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,280
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,800
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,240
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank.

142
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,280
They have way too much information.

143
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,160
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

144
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay.

145
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,040
Well, what did you want to see me about?

146
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
You're being watched!

147
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Be careful, Dan.

148
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Be careful.

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,960
Now we're back and we had some interesting phrases in the dialogue.

150
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,240
The first one being, you can never be too safe.

151
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,480
Fluency Builder.

152
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Alright, so this is a common mom phrase.

153
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,200
You often hear mothers say this when they're sending their kids off to school or whatever.

154
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,680
They say, don't talk to strangers and the kid says, well, why not?

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,840
You can never be too safe.

156
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,280
It's good to err on the side of caution.

157
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,480
So it's okay to be extra, extra safe or extra cautious, just in case.

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Exactly.

159
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,680
You never know what's going to happen, so it's better to be cautious than not.

160
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,720
And that's what this person is saying.

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
He's saying, well, security, it's important.

162
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,320
You can never be too safe.

163
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,560
You never know what might happen.

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
Is there another way that we can combine it?

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
Like you can never be too careful?

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Exactly.

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,480
Basically, the same thing.

168
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Same thing.

169
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Yeah.

170
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Alright.

171
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
What's our next phrase?

172
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,040
We're going to talk about this peeping Tom, this person that they caught.

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,120
They caught him red-handed.

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,760
We caught you red-handed.

175
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,920
Or he's been caught red-handed.

176
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
So what does that mean?

177
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,320
It's a very colorful phrase and I don't just mean that because we're calling him red-handed,

178
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,800
but to catch red-handed means to catch someone while they're doing something wrong.

179
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,720
So if I see you breaking into someone's house and I say, Marco, stop.

180
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I'm catching you.

181
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Stop now.

182
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I just caught you red-handed.

183
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
You saw me doing the act.

184
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Exactly.

185
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,720
And another way of saying this is you caught him with his hand in the cookie jar.

186
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Okay.

187
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
And this is another great phrase.

188
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,760
You can imagine a child who sees the cookies in a very special jar on the counter in the

189
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,400
kitchen and mom says, don't eat the cookies.

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,320
Well, the child goes into the kitchen and sees the cookies and opens the jar and puts

191
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,560
his hand in the jar and then mom comes and says, caught you.

192
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
That's a boy with his hand or a child with their hand in the cookie jar.

193
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
So it's the same thing.

194
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,280
I can say, I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar.

195
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Or you were caught red-handed.

196
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,880
All right.

197
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,360
And our last phrase for today is you are on a need to know basis.

198
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
All right.

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
This is a great one.

200
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,120
This is often said in spy movies, I think.

201
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,520
So we say you're on a need to know basis.

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,640
That means that if you really need to know something, then I will tell you.

203
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,160
But if not, I won't.

204
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,420
So you only have the information that is necessary.

205
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,280
No more or less.

206
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
You're on a need to know basis.

207
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Right.

208
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,920
So I say, tell me, Marco, tell me what happened.

209
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I want to know.

210
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Right.

211
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,480
And I can say, no, no, you're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know this.

212
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,540
So a need to know basis, as you say, very popular among spy movies and government movies

214
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
and stuff like that.

215
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Conspiracy movies.

216
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
Yeah.

217
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
All right.

218
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,280
So let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time and we'll be right back.

219
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:02,040
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

220
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,760
Is everything okay?

221
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:12,840
Just get over here.

222
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,080
Come in quickly.

223
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,480
So since when is your house a bank?

224
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
What do you mean?

225
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,240
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

226
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,120
Security, Dan security.

227
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,680
You can never be too safe.

228
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,800
You know, a lot of sickos out there.

229
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,480
Just the other day, they caught that heaping Tom red handed, had a high power telescope

230
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,280
and binoculars by his window.

231
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,960
What's the matter with you?

232
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Why are you acting all paranoid?

233
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Paranoid?

234
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm not paranoid.

235
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm cautious.

236
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,080
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

237
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,600
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

238
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank.

239
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
They have way too much information.

240
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,920
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

241
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Okay.

242
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,880
Well, what did you want to see me about?

243
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,240
You're being watched.

244
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Be careful, Dan.

245
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Be careful.

246
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:24,320
All right.

247
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,280
So the guy's a little bit paranoid.

248
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,920
There's another word for this as well.

249
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Similar, right?

250
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
It's schizo.

251
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,160
Schizophrenia is a disease and a lot of people have it and it's not too uncommon, but a popular

252
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,920
slang word to say someone's crazy is schizo.

253
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,000
So if you guys remember this movie, A Beautiful Mind, it's all about this famous mathematician.

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,280
He's named John Nash.

255
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
And well, he was a genius.

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,380
He came up with game theory and a lot of subsequent usage of this for economy, for many things.

257
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,160
But it was proven that he was a schizophrenic, right?

258
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,520
A paranoid schizophrenic.

259
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,320
So not only did he kind of have experienced reality in different ways, but he's also paranoid.

260
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,680
So he was afraid that the government was trying to kill him.

261
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,520
And so he was, he was irrationally afraid of everything going on around him.

262
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,480
And it made him very unsafe because he could hurt himself or hurt other people.

263
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,200
And the interesting thing about this is that there is no actual cure for it.

264
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,960
You just learn to cope and live with it.

265
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,000
So you never really get cured.

266
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
You just kind of live with it.

267
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,560
Learn how to understand what's real and what's not.

268
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
So it's interesting.

269
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,080
It's a great movie also, by the way, if you've never seen it or you get a chance to watch

270
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
it.

271
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,560
And that's all the time we have for today.
