00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,680
Amira and I are here today with an interesting lesson about a hotel situation.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,760
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more information?

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:24,780
Well, the situation is taking place in a hotel and someone is checking in and is obtaining

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,960
an upgrade.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,200
An upgrade, okay, that's an interesting word.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Why don't we listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all this vocabulary.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,560
Good afternoon.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,520
What can I do for you?

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
I'd like to check in please.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,960
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,680
All right.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Roberts.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,600
Oh, Mr. Roberts, we've been expecting you.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,440
And here is your key card to the presidential suite.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,080
But there must be some mistake.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
My reservation was for a standard room.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
Are you sure?

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Let me double check.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,040
Yeah, here, this is my confirmation number.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,520
You're right, Mr. Roberts.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,680
There seems to be a mix up.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,320
Unfortunately, we're overbooked at the moment.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,440
So?

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Not to worry.

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,720
We're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,880
Presidential suite, baby!

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,280
Okay, everyone, that is nice, huh?

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,880
Yeah, the guy is really excited that he's gonna get the presidential suite.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,320
Yes, there's some interesting phrases and vocabulary items here.

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,640
And I know, Marco, you want to talk about some of them.

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Right, the first one, and this is really useful for all of our listeners who travel a lot.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,280
This phrase will come in handy and it is, I have a reservation under the name.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,080
Under the name.

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,720
Under the name.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
Under the name.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,640
So before we explain this phrase, let's listen to some examples on how it is used in other

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:42,520
situations and then we'll come back and give you more information.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,760
Alright some really good examples there on how we could use this phrase in other situations.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,140
But just in case, let me explain it real fast.

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,280
Under the name means that when you go to the restaurant or a hotel and you tell them your

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,080
name, they know that you are the person that they have been expecting, they have been waiting.

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Yes.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,400
Well, I have chosen another useful phrase for you and it is mix up.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,760
Mix up.

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,080
Mix up.

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Mix up.

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,600
There seems to be a mix up.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Before we talk about this phrase, let's listen to some examples of how it is used.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:47,520
There was a mix up at the airport and my bags were sent to Antarctica.

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm sorry sir, there's been a terrible mix up.

54
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,600
We've given you the wrong baby.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,840
Okay that was useful and funny.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Yeah, that's the baby situation.

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Oh my god.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I can't imagine that happening.

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Yeah, I know.

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,040
Well guys, so a mix up is a confusion or a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,200
Exactly, well put.

62
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,560
Alright Marco, what do you have for us?

63
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,920
Okay, the next word that we should take a look at is overbooked.

64
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Overbooked.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Overbooked.

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Overbooked.

67
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,960
What does that mean?

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,660
So if a hotel or a flight is overbooked, it means that they are full.

69
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,200
They are more than full.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,720
Right, so they cannot accept any more people.

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Exactly.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,160
Okay, now why is this phrase useful?

73
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,600
Because it happens all the time.

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,000
There's so many other situations where you can use this word or hear it from other native

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,580
English speakers.

76
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,080
For example, a bus or a train can be overbooked.

77
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,480
Exactly, that's really common.

78
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay, let's take a look at the last phrase for today and that is complimentary upgrade.

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,120
Complimentary upgrade.

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Complimentary upgrade.

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,420
Complimentary upgrade.

82
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:21,240
So this means that, for example, when the hotel is overbooked and all of their standard

83
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,320
rooms are full, they will give you a better room, a more expensive room, but free.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
Yes, because it was not your fault.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,680
Right, this also happens sometimes, if you're lucky, on airplane flights.

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Yes.

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,240
So if you are in economy class and an airplane, but for some reason it's overbooked, they

88
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,680
will move you to business class or first class for free.

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,640
I have a similar story, but I'm not going to tell you about it now.

90
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,440
For now, let's go and listen to the dialogue one more time and when we come back, we'll

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
talk some more.

92
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:08,280
Good afternoon, what can I do for you?

93
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,680
I'd like to check in, please.

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,120
All right, Roberts.

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh, Mr. Roberts, we've been expecting you and here is your key card to the presidential

97
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
suite.

98
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,840
But there must be some mistake.

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
My reservation was for a standard room.

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
Are you sure?

101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Let me double check.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Yeah, here, this is my confirmation number.

103
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,480
You're right, Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a mix up.

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Unfortunately, we're overbooked at the moment.

105
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
So?

106
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,400
Not to worry, we're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

107
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
Woohoo!

108
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:56,640
Presidential suite, baby!

109
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
I love listening to this dialogue.

110
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,760
It's just so nice to see that someone is enjoying his upgrade so much.

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Yeah, especially since he was expecting just a really normal room and now he's going to

112
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,600
be treated like a king.

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,000
So Marco, have you ever gotten a complimentary upgrade?

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,280
Yes, yes, I did.

115
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,360
When I was traveling through India, I bought a normal seat in the train.

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,320
But for some reason, it was overbooked.

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:36,600
So I talked to the station manager and I got a complimentary upgrade to first class.

118
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,880
I had a similar experience as well.

119
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,800
I was flying from Shanghai to Qatar and I actually had an economy seat, but for some

120
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
reason they just upgraded me and I was so happy.

121
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Oh, really?

122
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
Like it wasn't overbooked?

123
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, I'm not sure because normally the night flight is not that full, but they upgraded

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,680
me for some reason and I was so happy.

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,920
It was an upgrade to first class.

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Wow, that's really cool.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,960
I would prefer a first class upgrade on an airplane, yeah, any day.

128
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Well, you know what really amazed me was like the food you get there.

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,040
You know, you have a five course meal.

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Oh, really?

131
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Yes.

132
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,440
And you get all the drinks you can get, right?

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Exactly.

134
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Yeah, I would be really happy there.

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,160
All right, everyone, we're out of time today, but be sure to listen tomorrow because we'll

136
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
be back again with another great podcast.

Yes, and we would also appreciate your suggestions.

And I hope you enjoyed the lesson today and Marco and I will be back tomorrow with another

142
00:08:49,840 --> 00:09:19,120
But for now, it's bye!
