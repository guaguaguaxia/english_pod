00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,440
My name is Catherine and it's the start of a very new year so we have some interesting

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,160
vocabulary for you today about the new year.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
That's right.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,800
So we are starting a new year.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,600
Why don't we just jump right into this dialogue.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,480
Let's see what's going on and we'll be back in a bit.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,720
It's almost midnight.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
We're about to start a brand new year.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I know.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's exciting.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,120
A new year is always like a clean slate.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,320
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,880
Do you have a new year's resolution?

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,800
I was thinking about it but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,840
Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Yeah, I know what you mean.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,400
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,560
volunteering work.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,760
That seems reasonable.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,360
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,680
Sure, as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,720
Well, we can't break tradition.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
It's bad luck.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,200
All right.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,280
So we've prepared a couple of different words for you on language takeaway.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Language takeaway.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,480
All right.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,280
The first word we have is actually a phrase.

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,600
We have this phrase brand new.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,720
Something is a brand new thing.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
That's right.

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,200
We said that we are starting a brand new year.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,520
And that's just another way of saying completely new.

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,640
So I want a brand new bicycle.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,480
It means I want a new bicycle from the store, not one from the garage.

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
That's right.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,960
So it's something completely new, never been used.

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
So we're starting a brand new year and we're saying it's exciting because it's a great

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,300
opportunity like having a clean slate.

43
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,800
So a clean slate.

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,520
Now this is an interesting phrase because you might not know what a slate is, but basically

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
it means that you start from the very beginning.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,520
So there's no history.

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,760
There's no nothing that you have to worry about.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,340
You start completely new.

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,840
That's a clean slate.

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
That's right.

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,720
So just imagine you're in class and you have the whiteboard or the chalkboard and you just

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,000
erase everything and then you start again.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,160
That's kind of what it means to have a clean slate, a new start.

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Exactly.

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,440
And so we have a clean slate.

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,500
We need to talk about what we will do with the clean slate.

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,840
And so one person asks the other, do you have any new year's resolutions?

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
That's right.

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,960
So this is one of the most popular things during the new year's is people make a new

60
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,020
year's resolution.

61
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,960
So a resolution is something that you have decided you will do.

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
I have many resolutions.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,720
I will learn to play the piano this year.

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,800
So in the new year, I will do this thing.

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
That's right.

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,480
So it's really like a promise, something that you promise yourself that you will do in the

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
new year.

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,160
So as you say, maybe start playing the piano.

69
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
That's right.

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,240
So we call that a resolution or if we want to be specific, we call it a new year's resolution.

71
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
Now at the very end of the dialogue, we heard another phrase.

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,880
This is quite strange.

73
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,320
They want to kiss at midnight.

74
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,760
And the one person says, well, we can't break tradition.

75
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
That's right.

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,480
To break a tradition or to break tradition.

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,200
That basically means to not do something that we usually do.

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
All right.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
So you can follow tradition.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,640
That means that you do the same thing maybe every year.

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,880
But if you break tradition, that means you don't do what you are expected to do.

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,720
So remember that verb is to break, break tradition.

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
That's right.

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
All right.

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,160
So let's review this vocab.

86
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:50,600
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

87
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
It's almost midnight.

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,120
We're about to start a brand new year.

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,720
I know it's so exciting.

90
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,720
A new year is always like a clean slate, a fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
and goals.

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,000
Do you have a new year's resolution?

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,880
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Yeah.

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
I know what you mean.

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,480
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,080
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some

99
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,640
volunteering work.

100
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,800
That seems reasonable.

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Sure.

103
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,760
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

104
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Well, we can't break tradition.

105
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
It's bad luck.

106
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
All right.

107
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:40,680
So let's take a look at those phrases now on Fluency Builder.

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,400
So there's a phrase in here that I use all the time.

109
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,920
We heard about this resolution to go to the gym more often.

110
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,600
And the person said, you know, I never really go to the gym.

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
And the other said, you know, I know what you mean.

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,320
Yeah, that's right.

113
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,200
She says, yeah, I know what you mean.

114
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,600
And so basically we use this when you agree with the person, you understand what they

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
are saying.

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Yeah.

117
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,960
It's almost like saying I had the same experience.

118
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,960
So maybe I also belong to a gym and I never go to that gym just like you.

119
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
So it means I know what you mean.

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
I have the same problem.

121
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
That's right.

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,320
So you can just agree with someone, completely agree with someone by saying, yeah, I know

123
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,480
what you mean or I know what you mean.

124
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I know what you mean.

125
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
All right.

126
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,960
So, well, this year we want to keep things a little bit more simple.

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,000
And we said, well, maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All right.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
So let's think about this to get together with friends.

130
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,160
Lots of words there, but you can see friends, but to get together means to be social with,

131
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,400
to hang out with, to do things together.

132
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
But it's not very specific.

133
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,100
It's a nice way to say just to be with your friends.

134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
That's right.

135
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,960
So maybe you are going with your friends out, maybe shopping, maybe to the movies.

136
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,680
So you say, yeah, I'm going to get together with my friends later on this afternoon.

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
All right.

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,280
So we can get together with friends as a resolution.

139
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,420
That's something we want to do in the near future.

140
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,960
But for now, we're going to get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

141
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,840
That's the New Year's plan.

142
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
That's right.

143
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,320
So it may seem strange.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,000
It's not actually a phrasal verb or a colloquial phrase.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,320
There is actually a ball that goes down as the countdown begins to midnight.

146
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,400
And once it completely disappears, then you celebrate the New Year.

147
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,120
So you actually see this big round ball coming down in Times Square.

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Yeah.

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,140
It's a way to count down to the New Year.

150
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,960
So people often say 10, 9, 8, 7 to the countdown and the ball will drop.

151
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,360
And that means it's the New Year.

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,040
So this is something that we refer to.

153
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,120
It's something we talk about when we want to discuss the New Year.

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
So we'll watch the ball drop together.

155
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,700
It's an event.

156
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,700
That's right.

157
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Okay.

158
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
So a lot of great stuff there.

159
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:12,280
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time.

160
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
It's almost midnight.

161
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,800
We're about to start a brand new year.

162
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I know.

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
It's so exciting.

164
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,920
A new year is always like a clean slate.

165
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,480
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

166
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,680
Do you have a New Year's resolution?

167
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,600
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolutions.

168
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,520
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

169
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Yeah, I know what you mean.

170
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,160
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some

172
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
volunteering work.

173
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,500
That seems reasonable.

174
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,240
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

175
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Sure.

176
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,480
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

177
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,460
Well, we can't break tradition.

178
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,080
It's bad luck.

179
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,800
All right.

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,280
So talking about New Year's, everyone makes New Year's resolutions and people get together

181
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,520
to watch the ball drop in Times Square.

182
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Now this is more of an American thing.

183
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,740
Have you ever experienced anything different for New Year's?

184
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,160
Some other type of tradition?

185
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
Because also here, they kiss at midnight.

186
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
That's right.

187
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,620
Well, that's a pretty standard American tradition.

188
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,920
People will get together and they'll have the TV on.

189
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,360
They'll have a party or they'll be with friends and they will maybe watch some fireworks or

190
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,200
watch the TV as the ball drops.

191
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
So I've done both.

192
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,600
I've gone out because sometimes you go outside, it's very cold, but you go to a bridge or

193
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,740
a park or somewhere public or the city government or the state will have some kind of special

194
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,960
fireworks display.

195
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,280
So then everyone will watch the fireworks or watch a big TV screen.

196
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,920
And then when it's midnight, when it's the new year, then everyone will kiss.

197
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,040
So everyone will kiss.

198
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,720
Maybe I mean, is it like just between couples or whoever's available, you kiss whoever's

199
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
there?

200
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
Sometimes it's whoever is available.

201
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,880
That's happened to me where you turn around and you say, oh, hi, I don't know you.

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
So the tradition is you have to kiss someone at midnight.

203
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
So this is for good luck.

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Yes.

205
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
For good luck in the new year.

206
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Yes.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
So if you don't kiss someone, then you're kind of breaking the tradition.

208
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
It's kind of sad.

209
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,640
And it's unlucky.

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,080
An interesting way of celebrating New Year's, this is as we said, in the United States,

211
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,640
watching the ball drop, kissing someone at midnight.

212
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,000
So we are really curious to know how you celebrate your New Year's in your country because maybe

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,360
you have similar traditions or very different things.

214
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
That's right.

215
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,800
And I know some places like Italy even have special foods you are supposed to eat to bring

216
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,840
wealth and prosperity in the new year.

217
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
So let us know.

218
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

219
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
All right.

220
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
We'll see you guys there.

221
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Bye.

222
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Happy New Year.
