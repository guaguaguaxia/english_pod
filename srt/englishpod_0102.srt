00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,600
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,440
And today we have an advanced lesson for all of you and a very good one because we're going

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,600
to be talking about a very serious topic, global warming.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,880
That's right.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,680
And you know, even though most people agree that global warming is a big problem, there's

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,240
still this sort of fringe element of people who believe that actually global warming doesn't

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
exist.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Exactly.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,520
And that's what we're going to be looking at today.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,560
But before we tell you more or less what the dialogue is about, let's take a look at some

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,800
words in vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,440
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,280
We're going to look at two words here and you'll hear both of these in the dialogue.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,000
So the first one is polar ice caps.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,320
Polar ice caps.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,400
Polar ice caps.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,880
So when we talk about polar ice caps, polar is...

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Like the poles.

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
The poles, right?

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,200
The north and south poles of the earth.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Okay.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
So the extreme...

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
The top and bottom.

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
The top and bottom of the planet.

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Yep.

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Okay.

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
And what about ice caps?

31
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,800
So the polar ice caps are masses of ice that live or that exist on the top and the bottom

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,880
of the world.

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,240
We have these big chunks of ice that are on the top at the bottom of the planet.

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Yes.

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
They're there all year round.

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Okay.

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,560
So these are the polar ice caps.

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
What about our next word?

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,980
Well, next word is endangered species.

40
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,680
An endangered species.

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,880
An endangered species.

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Okay.

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,600
So what is an endangered species?

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,520
It's a type of animal that is at risk of completely dying out.

45
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Okay.

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,160
So it's not completely extinct.

47
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Right.

48
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
So they're still...

49
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
It's in danger.

50
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Okay.

51
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
In danger of.

52
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Yeah.

53
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,760
So an example of endangered species would be...

54
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,040
The Bengal tigers.

55
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Okay.

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
The tigers or the pandas.

57
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Right.

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Or maybe gorillas.

59
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Right.

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,920
So all of these animals, there are very few of them left in the world.

61
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,960
So they are endangered species.

62
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Okay.

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,240
So with that, I think we're just about ready to turn to our dialogue.

64
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,360
Now here we're going to learn a lot of language that you can use when you want to make an

65
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,520
argument or express your point of view in a very sort of academic way.

66
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,840
But Marco, what are we arguing about here?

67
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,360
So we're going to listen as a college professor is lecturing about global warming and well,

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:31,880
one of the students doesn't really agree with what he's saying.

69
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,760
And therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

70
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Questions?

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah.

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,120
In the lecture you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
cooling.

74
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Well, yes.

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
Essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles.

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,320
If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,200
ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,240
That are global temperatures rising.

80
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,960
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll-

81
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
You'll be misled.

82
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,160
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s.

83
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,480
Then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,960
Young lady, I beg to differ.

85
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides.

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,880
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global

87
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
cooling hypothesis.

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,560
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing

89
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,700
that there's some kind of climate crisis.

90
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,320
This scaremongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,180
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide

92
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,480
contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,520
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

94
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.

95
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,360
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
on foreign oil.

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,160
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

98
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,960
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

99
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

100
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,480
Yeah, and a duplicitous one at that.

101
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,000
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,340
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which

103
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
say smoking doesn't harm health?

104
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,080
You're full of it.

105
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,960
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:45,840
All right, so apparently this college professor is not very truthful in what he's saying,

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
right?

108
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,640
Well, yeah, maybe he believes it, but they certainly have very strong and differing opinions.

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,140
So that's the interesting part is that we heard a lot of language that she used to argue

110
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
her point of view.

111
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,560
So this is interesting and we can start now looking at some of this language in Language

112
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,480
Takeaway.

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,960
Language Takeaway.

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,400
So the college professor was arguing against this idea of global warming and she said,

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,960
look, it's an indisputable fact.

116
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,680
Okay, an indisputable fact.

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
An indisputable fact.

118
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,200
Okay, so let's break it down and let's take a look at this word, indisputable.

119
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,240
You can't argue against it.

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,040
Okay, so something indisputable is you can't argue with it and will affect something that's

121
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
true.

122
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Okay, so you can't argue with this piece of information.

123
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Yeah.

124
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
All right.

125
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Indisputable fact.

126
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
So why don't we give a few examples?

127
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,720
It's an indisputable fact that China is the most populous nation on earth.

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
Okay, exactly.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,000
Or it's an indisputable fact that EnglishPod is the best podcast out there.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,480
Indeed, it is indisputable.

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
All right.

132
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,760
So indisputable fact and what about our next word?

133
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,040
Well, the student accused the professor of scaremongering.

134
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Scaremongering.

135
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Scaremongering.

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay, now this is kind of a strange word, scaremongering.

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,040
Yeah, and I think some examples will help us to understand the meaning a little bit

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
better.

139
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Example one.

140
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Software flaws are not the same as virus attacks and saying otherwise is just scaremongering.

141
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,200
Example two.

142
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,160
There's been a lot of scaremongering caused by the rumor that mobile phones cause cancer.

143
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,440
Okay, so basically we understand that it's kind of putting fear in people's minds.

144
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,080
Yeah, it's sort of like selling fear for your own benefit.

145
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,840
Okay, so making people afraid for some objective or some purpose.

146
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,560
Yeah, and you know, this word reminds me of the word a fishmonger.

147
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,480
Okay, a fishmonger.

148
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
What's that?

149
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
Which is basically a seller of fish.

150
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,640
So a scaremonger is a seller of fear.

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,880
Okay, interesting.

152
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
So now we have a way of remembering it.

153
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Yes.

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Scaremongering.

155
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
All right, and moving on to our next word, we have autocratic.

156
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Autocratic.

157
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,960
An autocratic country.

158
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,080
So an autocratic country is ruled by someone who holds total power.

159
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,160
Okay, so we have an autocratic country.

160
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,160
So basically we have a leader that rules everything, right?

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Right.

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,400
So if we apply it not only to a country, we can say a person is autocratic.

163
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,800
Yeah, you could say, I can't stand my boss's autocratic leadership style.

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
Or maybe a company.

165
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,680
This company is a very autocratic organization.

166
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay, very good.

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,880
And what about our last word?

168
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,520
The student accused the professor of being duplicitous.

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, so she said he is duplicitous.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, duplicitous.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
All right, what does that mean?

172
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,520
When you are duplicitous, you have behavior that is dishonest and is designed to trick

173
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
people.

174
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay, so you're not a very honest person if you're duplicitous.

175
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,240
Yeah, you're telling lies as a means of making people do something or tricking them.

176
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
Okay, very good.

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,160
So a duplicitous person or a duplicitous idea maybe?

178
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Okay.

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,120
All right, so these are all the words that we have on language takeaway today.

180
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,660
But now let's move on to some very interesting phrases that we can use to put forward some

181
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,360
arguments in Fluency Builder.

182
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Fluency Builder.

183
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,440
Okay, and Marco, you actually just mentioned our first phrase, which is I'm putting forth

184
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,920
the argument that.

185
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,460
Okay, so putting forth the argument that.

186
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,480
So if you put forth an argument.

187
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
You present it.

188
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
You present it or you push it towards somebody.

189
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,920
Yeah, you give it.

190
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,400
So can we just put forth an argument?

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,640
Well actually you can put forth a lot of things, like put forth a suggestion.

192
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,160
Okay, I'm putting forth a suggestion that we should get a new computer.

193
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Or an idea.

194
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,920
Tim put forth the idea that we should go on vacation to Hawaii.

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Oh, good idea.

196
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,220
All right, so you can put forth many different things.

197
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,960
So the professor obviously is putting forth the argument that global warming is a myth

198
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,800
and the student obviously totally disagreed and she said you have to concede that.

199
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay, you have to concede that.

200
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,320
You have to concede that.

201
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,440
All right, so this word concede or you have to concede.

202
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,960
Why don't we listen to some examples before we listen to the meaning.

203
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,560
Example one.

204
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm sorry, but I can't concede with you on this point.

205
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
Example two.

206
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,320
Julie conceded that she might have forgotten her sister's birthday.

207
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,600
Example three.

208
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,280
Both philosophers conceded that their philosophies have some errors.

209
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,480
Okay, so you have to concede that.

210
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,960
Basically you have to agree that this one point in my argument is true.

211
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,560
Maybe you're arguing many different points with somebody but you tell them, well, you

212
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,120
have to concede that the earth is round.

213
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,800
Okay, so that part I can't argue with.

214
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
It's really true.

215
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Okay, very good.

216
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
So concede.

217
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,920
Now, at the end of the dialogue, the student accused the professor of being in the pocket

218
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
of the oil lobby.

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
Okay, so he's in the pocket of.

220
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,280
To be in the pocket of.

221
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,640
All right, so if I have somebody in my pocket, what does that mean?

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,440
It means basically you're bribing them.

223
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,280
Okay, so maybe I have the senator in my pocket.

224
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,120
Okay, so obviously you're paying the senator to do what you want.

225
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Okay, very good.

226
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,920
So it's another way, it's a very informal way of saying I'm bribing somebody or that

227
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,360
person is being bribed.

228
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
That's right.

229
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,520
So why don't we move to our final phrase.

230
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,960
The student was talking about the professor's so-called findings.

231
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,200
Okay, so your so-called findings.

232
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
So-called.

233
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,320
So this word so-called.

234
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,600
You use this word when you want to take away from the importance of an idea.

235
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,400
All right, so I use it before a noun, right?

236
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay, so for example, my so-called friends.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
Okay, so these friends are not really your friends maybe.

238
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,840
So yeah, they're friends in name but they don't act like friends.

239
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,920
Okay, so you can say my so-called job.

240
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,480
Okay, so maybe you kind of go to work but do nothing all day.

241
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,160
Right, or maybe you don't even really like what you do.

242
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Right.

243
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,200
Right, so my so-called job, my so-called friends or maybe my so-called teacher.

244
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
Okay, so this is a bad teacher.

245
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Exactly.

246
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,000
So we use it a lot with many different nouns, right?

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's right.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,840
So that's our last phrase for fluency builder.

249
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,200
Now I think it'll help us to understand these words and phrases a little bit better to hear

250
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:48,760
them again in context.

251
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,440
And therefore global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

252
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Questions?

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,680
Yeah, in the lecture you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting

254
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
global cooling?

255
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,920
Well, yes.

256
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,240
Essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles.

257
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,680
Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

258
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar

259
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,080
ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

260
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,120
But are global temperatures rising?

261
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,840
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll...

262
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,240
You'll be misled.

263
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,000
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s.

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,360
Then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

265
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,800
Young lady, I beg to differ.

266
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there is evidence for both sides.

267
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global

268
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,920
cooling hypothesis.

269
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,400
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing

270
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,560
that there's some kind of climate crisis.

271
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,200
This scaremongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

272
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,080
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide

273
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,360
contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

274
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

275
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,840
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.

276
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,240
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,600
on foreign oil.

278
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,040
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

279
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,840
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

280
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,360
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

281
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Yeah, and a duplicitous one at that.

282
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,880
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

283
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,220
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which

284
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,220
say smoking doesn't harm health?

285
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,960
You're full of it.

286
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.

287
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,800
All right, very good.

288
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,480
So interesting ways of putting forth arguments.

289
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,200
And well, it's an interesting topic and very controversial, right?

290
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
That's right.

291
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,960
But what I noticed in this dialogue is that the student was pretty assertive in putting

292
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,440
forth her argument and standing up to the teacher.

293
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Right.

294
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
And she was with the teacher a lot.

295
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,200
And this is interesting because it's a very cultural aspect, I think, right?

296
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah.

297
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,800
In North American universities, there is this idea that it's really important to think critically

298
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,840
and to argue against different ideas and to really speak up when you don't agree with

299
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
something.

300
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Right.

301
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,520
So basically, there's this culture of questioning, not only what you're being taught, but you

302
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,800
can also question the teacher.

303
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,520
You don't actually have to believe everything that the teacher is saying.

304
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Exactly.

305
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,800
And I think this situation is really interesting.

306
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,200
You know, you always go to these lectures and there's always a question and answer period

307
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
at the end of the lectures.

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,880
And I think that there's like this group of sort of academically minded people who feel

309
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,240
like it's really cool to ask these really difficult questions and engage in arguments

310
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
with the profs.

311
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,780
Yeah, yeah, that's really true.

312
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,040
But actually, she used a lot of polite language and a lot of polite ways of actually arguing

313
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
with the professor until the last point when she said, you're full of it.

314
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
Yeah, you're full of it.

315
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Right.

316
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
You're full of it.

317
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
So what's she saying here?

318
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
All right.

319
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,880
She's basically saying that you're full of shit.

320
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
So yeah, you wouldn't really say that.

321
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,000
So to be a little bit less rude, you would just say, you're full of it.

322
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

323
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,240
But that is one step too far.

324
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,880
I think this would be considered a little bit rude.

325
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Yeah.

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
For a professor, yeah.

327
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,920
But I guess if you don't believe what your friend is telling you, or maybe he's exaggerating,

328
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,360
you can say, oh, you're full of it.

329
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Yeah.

330
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,000
So we've covered some great argumentative language here in this dialogue, but we want

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,800
to give you an opportunity to try out some of this language.

332
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
So come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Right.

334
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,600
We are there to answer any questions or doubts, and we'll see you guys there.

335
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
All right, guys.

336
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Until next time, goodbye.

337
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:18,100
Bye.
