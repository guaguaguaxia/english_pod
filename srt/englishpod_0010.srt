1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Welcome back English learners.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,120
My name is Marco and I am joined by...

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Erika.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
How are you Erika?

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,120
I'm doing great.

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
Marco and you?

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
Excellent.

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm doing really well and I'm really excited about our lesson for today.

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
That's right.

10
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,240
We've got an intermediate lesson today and we're going to study some real English.

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
English that you use every day, right?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,440
English that native speakers really use.

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Exactly.

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,000
So today, as Erika mentioned, we have an intermediate lesson and not only is it intermediate, but

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,560
it's a business lesson.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Yes.

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,960
So today we're listening in to a sales meeting and we're going to learn some great useful

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,280
English to talk about sales strategies.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,200
So we're going to learn English for sales strategies, for making suggestions and for

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,160
responding to suggestions.

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Great.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,680
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for today?

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,120
Vocabulary preview.

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,000
So our vocabulary preview is a part of our lesson when we teach you some really important

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,640
words that will help you to understand the dialogue better.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Okay, great.

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,620
So that is what vocabulary preview is.

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,240
We have two words for you today and we can start off by looking at the first one.

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,440
Our first word today is drive sales.

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,780
Drive sales.

32
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,960
Drive sales.

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,200
To drive sales.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
And that means?

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,440
To increase sales.

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Right.

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
To sell more.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Exactly.

39
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,960
So to drive sales.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay.

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,280
So now let's look at our second word and it's an interesting one.

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
It's promotion.

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Promotion.

44
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Promotion.

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Promotion.

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,680
So, Erika, what is a promotion exactly?

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay.

48
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,440
So here we're not really talking about getting a better job, right?

49
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Okay.

50
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
Not like a job promotion.

51
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
No.

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
We're talking about a marketing strategy.

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Okay.

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,200
So I can give you an example.

55
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,120
Suppose that I want to buy shampoo.

56
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,000
And if I go to the supermarket and I see buy one and get one free.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,480
So that's a two for one.

58
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720
That's a two for one promotion.

59
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Yeah.

60
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Okay.

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
That's a sales promotion.

62
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Or?

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
Perhaps the shampoo in the supermarket is less expensive than usual.

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Maybe, yeah, usually maybe it costs $5 but today it costs $4.

65
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
That's a sales promotion.

66
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Great.

67
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
So that's a really good marketing strategy.

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Exactly.

69
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,240
So let's hear this word in our dialogue today.

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Great.

71
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,360
So we are ready to listen to our dialogue.

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
It's going to be pretty fast.

73
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,120
So it might be a little bit difficult to understand.

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,560
But don't worry if you don't understand everything because later in this lesson we're going to

75
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,200
explain all the important words and phrases.

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:57,080
All right, people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about

77
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,360
our sales and we need to do it now.

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,520
I want concrete solutions.

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,240
How do you plan to drive sales?

80
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Roger.

81
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,520
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market.

82
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,280
So maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors.

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
Lower our prices.

84
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Not very creative.

85
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
It'll never fly with Swan.

86
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,720
What kind of thinking is that?

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Geez.

88
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Anyone have a better plan?

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Natalie.

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,600
Perhaps a promotion.

91
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

92
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,320
That's the same thing.

93
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Bad idea.

94
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Really bad idea.

95
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Damn it, people.

96
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Come on.

97
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Think.

98
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
We're going to be here any minute.

99
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Hello, Mr. Swan.

100
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Oh, Mr. Swan.

101
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Hello, Mr. Swan.

102
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Do we have any ideas yet?

103
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Yes, Mr. Swan.

104
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
We were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

105
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
A two for one promotion.

106
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Hmm.

107
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I kind of like the sound of that.

108
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
It sounds like something we should consider.

109
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah, exactly.

110
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
That's just what I was thinking.

111
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

112
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm glad we thought of that.

113
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Very creative.

114
00:03:50,320 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay, so an interesting manager, right?

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,600
I don't know about interesting.

116
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,460
Maybe I would think bad manager.

117
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,880
We're going to talk about him later on in the show.

118
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,440
But now, let's take a look at our language takeaway.

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Language takeaway.

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,720
Okay, so language takeaway is the part of our lesson where we teach you the most important

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,080
words from the dialogue.

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,880
All these words that we are going to focus on can be found in today's dialogue.

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Exactly.

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,920
So we have three words for you today.

125
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Let's look at the first one.

126
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,760
Match the competitors.

127
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,500
Match the competitors.

128
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,200
Match the competitors.

129
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,080
Match the competitors.

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
Great.

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,200
So we have some examples for you so you can listen and try and see if you can figure out

132
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,000
what match the competitors really means.

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Example one.

134
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:13,600
We guarantee that we can match the competitors' lowest price.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Example two.

136
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,440
It's impossible for us to match the competitors.

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,760
Our costs are just too high.

138
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,120
Example three.

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:44,600
Do you think we can match our competitors' prices and still keep our quality high?

140
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Ah, okay.

141
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,260
So I see that match the competitors means to be as good as or better than other companies

142
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,200
in the same industry.

143
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Exactly.

144
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Match the competitors.

145
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,640
All right, so let's move to our second word today for Language Takeaways and it is in

146
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
the market.

147
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
In the market.

148
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
In the market.

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,140
In the market.

150
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,160
We heard this phrase in the dialogue and it means in the industry.

151
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,560
Exactly.

152
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,280
I can say, for example, EnglishPod is the best language pod in the market.

153
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,800
So of all the podcasts that teach English, EnglishPod is the best.

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Of course.

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm not doubt about it.

156
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I totally agree.

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Right.

158
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,960
Or I can give you another example.

159
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,880
iPods are the most popular MP3 players in the market.

160
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,720
So of all the MP3 players in the world, iPods are the most popular.

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,760
So let's move to our final word for today and it is...

162
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,840
It'll never fly.

163
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
It'll never fly.

164
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
It'll never fly.

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,620
It will never fly.

166
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,880
So this phrase sounds a little bit strange.

167
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
I know.

168
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Fly?

169
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Are we talking about an airplane here?

170
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
What's going on?

171
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Exactly.

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
But we're not.

173
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,640
So we're going to give you some examples and try and guess what it'll never fly really

174
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,680
means.

175
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,080
Example one.

176
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,180
This marketing plan will never fly.

177
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:24,080
It's just too expensive.

178
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Example two.

179
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,160
What you want to sell bikinis in Alaska?

180
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,040
That'll never fly.

181
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,840
Example three.

182
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Brad told me his idea for a film script, but the story will never fly.

183
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,480
It's not interesting enough.

184
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,520
So it means it won't work.

185
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
It won't work.

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
It's not a good idea.

187
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
They'll never agree.

188
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Exactly.

189
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Great.

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,320
So now we've seen a lot of useful phrases and we are ready to listen to our dialogue

191
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
a second time.

192
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,440
But this time it's going to be slow.

193
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,860
So you'll be able to understand a little bit better and you'll be able to hear the words

194
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,240
and phrases we were just talking about.

195
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,760
All right, people.

196
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,520
We're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales and we

197
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
need to do it now.

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,240
I want concrete solutions.

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,000
How do you plan to drive sales, Roger?

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,880
So maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors.

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,160
Lower our prices.

203
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,840
Not very creative.

204
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,400
It'll never fly with Swan.

205
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,760
What kind of thinking is that?

206
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
Geez.

207
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,560
Anybody else have a better plan?

208
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Natalie?

209
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,360
Um, perhaps, um, a promotion, maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

210
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,520
What?

211
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,560
That's the same thing.

212
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,120
Bad idea.

213
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,160
Really bad idea.

214
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,200
Damn it, people.

215
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
Come on.

216
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Think.

217
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,320
The CEO will be here any minute.

218
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
Hello, Mr. Swan.

219
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
Oh, Mr. Swan.

220
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,680
Hello, Mr. Swan.

221
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,760
Do we have any ideas yet?

222
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,500
Yes, Mr. Swan.

223
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,320
We were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

224
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,840
A two for one promotion.

225
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Hmm.

226
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,580
I kind of like the sound of that.

227
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,240
It sounds like something we should consider.

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Yeah.

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Exactly.

230
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,520
That's just what I was thinking.

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,640
In fact, that's a brilliant idea.

232
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm glad we thought of that.

233
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Very creative.

234
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Okay, great.

235
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,920
I hope everyone understands a lot better now.

236
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,960
And I hope everyone could listen out for some of those key words.

237
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Right.

238
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,400
So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

239
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,640
Fluency Builder.

240
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,720
So with Fluency Builder, we try to help you increase your fluency.

241
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,920
We take a word or phrase that you already know and show you how to say it a little bit

242
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,160
more naturally, a little bit more like a native English speaker.

243
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Right.

244
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,280
And we have three of these words for you today.

245
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Yeah.

246
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Let's start with the first one.

247
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Okay.

248
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,720
So often students will say something like, I'll be here soon.

249
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Or I will arrive soon.

250
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Right.

251
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720
And these sentences are correct.

252
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,800
They're totally fine, but I think there's a better way to say this.

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Right.

254
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,480
And we heard it in the dialogue, so let's listen to what the person in the dialogue

255
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
said.

256
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,080
The CEO will be here any minute.

257
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,040
The CEO will be here any minute.

258
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Okay.

259
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,000
So, be here any minute.

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
He'll be here any minute.

261
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,600
It just sounds a little bit more natural.

262
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Yeah.

263
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,120
I think I use this phrase quite often.

264
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,200
He'll be here any minute.

265
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
He'll be here soon.

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah.

267
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Great.

268
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Okay.

269
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,080
So, let's move on to our second phrase for Fluency Builder.

270
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,440
So, this phrase will help you to learn how to say, I'm thinking about something in a

271
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,040
better sounding way.

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Right.

273
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,400
So, you can say something like, we are thinking about a sales strategy.

274
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Or that sounds like something we should think about.

275
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Right.

276
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
And it's perfectly correct.

277
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Yeah.

278
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,560
There's no problem with this.

279
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
But in the dialogue, we heard something a little bit different.

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,400
So, let's listen to it.

281
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,700
It sounds like something we should consider.

282
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,240
It sounds like something we should consider.

283
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,640
So, consider sounds like a pretty natural way of saying it.

284
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Right.

285
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Yeah.

286
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
And you know, I think it sounds really kind of smart.

287
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Yeah.

288
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,800
It sounds more formal even.

289
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
A little more professional.

290
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Yeah.

291
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Yeah.

292
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
It's a good word.

293
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Yeah.

294
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Okay.

295
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Brilliant.

296
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
So, let's move on to our third word.

297
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Marco, you already said our third word.

298
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Oh, yeah.

299
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I actually did.

300
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Brilliant.

301
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
That's a great word right there.

302
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,400
A lot of people might say, that's a great idea or great.

303
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,680
But in the dialogue, we heard another way of saying the same idea.

304
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,520
That's a brilliant idea.

305
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,760
That's a brilliant idea.

306
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Okay.

307
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,400
So, this is great.

308
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,600
But I would have to say that it's a little bit more British English.

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Yeah.

310
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'd agree with you there.

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
But I also think it sort of gives more power to this idea that it's a good idea, brilliant

312
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
idea.

313
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
And it's a really, really good idea.

314
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Yeah.

315
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Yeah.

316
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
I like that word.

317
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Yeah.

318
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Okay.

319
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,360
So, we're ready to listen to our dialogue again a third time, but at its normal speed.

320
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:04,520
All right, people.

321
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,280
We're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales and we

322
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,200
need to do it now.

323
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,320
I want concrete solutions.

324
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
How do you plan to drive sales?

325
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Roger.

326
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,320
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market.

327
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,040
So maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors.

328
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
Lower our prices.

329
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Not very creative.

330
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,120
It'll never fly with Swan.

331
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,480
What kind of thinking is that?

332
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Geez.

333
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Anyone have a better plan?

334
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
Natalie.

335
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,400
Perhaps a promotion.

336
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

337
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,120
That's the same thing.

338
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Bad idea.

339
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Very bad idea.

340
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Damn it, people.

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Come on.

342
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Think.

343
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
The CEO will be here any minute.

344
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Hello, Mr. Swan.

345
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Oh, Mr. Swan.

346
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Hello, Mr. Swan.

347
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Do we have any ideas yet?

348
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Yes, Mr. Swan.

349
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
We were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

350
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
A two for one promotion.

351
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Hmm.

352
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
I kind of like the sound of that.

353
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
It sounds like something we should consider.

354
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Yeah, exactly.

355
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
That's just what I was thinking.

356
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

357
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm glad we thought of that.

358
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Very creative.

359
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
I'm glad we thought of that.

360
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Very creative.

361
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm glad we thought of that.

362
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Very creative.

363
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm glad we thought of that.

364
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm glad we thought of that.

365
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
In fact, it's a brilliant idea I'm glad we thought of that.

366
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Very creative.

367
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,520
All right.

368
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,720
So listening to this dialogue makes you think about this boss.

369
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm pretty sure everyone has had a manager or a supervisor that's similar to this guy.

370
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,760
Yeah, this boss, Clark, I would have to say he sounds like a terrible person to work for.

371
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,920
Yeah, that's true.

372
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,640
If you're a manager, you want to motivate your employees.

373
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,080
I think it's the most important thing a manager does is to encourage his or her employees

374
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,320
and to help support them to grow and to be better people in the job.

375
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,200
And this guy is totally not doing this.

376
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,000
And you can tell because they are a little bit scared of talking and he cuts them off

377
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
with saying, oh, it's a bad idea.

378
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,120
Give me a better idea and stuff like that.

379
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, I could never work for a guy like this.

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,300
You know, my first boss that I had when I first entered the workforce, I was in a very

381
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,900
junior position and I was working for a large company and the general manager of the company,

382
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
he was amazing.

383
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,820
He was so encouraging.

384
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,280
He knew every single employee's name, first name, and he would make an effort to stop

385
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,680
and say hello and ask them how things were going.

386
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
And you know what?

387
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,720
This left me with such a good feeling about the company that I really wanted to work hard

388
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,400
for this company and try my best.

389
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,720
And I think that I've never met such a great boss as this guy.

390
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,360
No, I think that's true.

391
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,320
Especially if you have a boss that's encouraging and motivating like that, it makes you work

392
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,680
harder and makes you feel part of a really special team.

393
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,600
And that's something we can all agree on.

394
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,920
And I'm sure all our managers out there do the same.

395
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Well, you know what?

396
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,120
I hope some of our listeners log on to our website and maybe they can tell us some experiences

397
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,160
with bad managers or good managers or if they are managers, how they handle things.

398
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Yeah.

399
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,760
And hopefully they can use some of these great phrases that we talked about today.

400
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Great.

401
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,800
