00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,240
And today we're bringing you another great lesson and this time we're going to be shopping.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
That's right.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,480
Actually a lot of our users asked for some lessons about shopping, right?

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Exactly.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
And I think one of the most important things when you go shopping is to get a good price.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
That's right.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,480
So we're going to be teaching you how to bargain.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,760
So Marco, you just mentioned a really great word.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,960
Let's look at it in Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
All right.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,080
So we're going to preview the word bargain today.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Bargain.

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Bargain.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Bargain.

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,920
Now this is an interesting word because it's a verb and a noun.

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
That's right.

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,080
So a bargain is a good price, right?

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Okay.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,160
So a bargain is a good price.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Yeah.

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,360
This t-shirt was a bargain.

25
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,360
I only paid a dollar for it.

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Okay.

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
So that is a bargain.

28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Yes.

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
But to bargain as a verb?

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,920
To try and get a good price.

31
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
So it's very similar to negotiate.

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Yeah.

33
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,960
So I would say, it costs a hundred dollars.

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,800
And then I would say maybe, no, I'll give you 50.

35
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
75.

36
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
And then I'll say 60.

37
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Et cetera, et cetera.

38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
And that's to bargain, right?

39
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Yep.

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Okay.

41
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
So we're going to be bargaining.

42
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,680
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time as we have a woman bargaining in a store,

43
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
right?

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
That's right.

45
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:29,480
Hello, may I help you?

46
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,120
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

47
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,760
How much is it?

48
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,240
That one is $150.

49
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
$150?

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
What about this other one over here?

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
That's 140.

52
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,480
That's a bit out of my price range.

53
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Can you give me a better deal?

54
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,280
This is an exclusive design by Da Marco.

55
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,000
What's a bargain at that price?

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Well, I don't know.

57
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
I think I'll shop around.

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Okay, okay.

59
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
How about $100?

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

61
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,760
What if I take both dresses?

62
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,360
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

63
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,040
190 for both.

64
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I don't know.

65
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,640
It's still a bit pricey.

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Thanks anyway.

67
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,080
Okay, my final price, $100 for both.

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
There's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Great.

70
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,400
You caused a deal.

71
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,760
All right.

72
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,640
That was some good bargaining skills right there.

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Yeah, and you know what?

74
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,400
She used a lot of good language to get a cheaper price, didn't she?

75
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
That was good.

77
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,280
So, let's take a look at this language in Language Takeaway.

78
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
Language Takeaway.

79
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, the first word we have in Language Takeaway today, price range.

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,440
Price range.

81
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Price range.

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,760
Price range.

83
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Price range.

84
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
What does that mean exactly?

85
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,560
So, price range is the minimum and the maximum that you're willing to spend for a thing that

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
you want to buy.

87
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Exactly.

88
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,680
So, in the dialogue we heard, it's out of my price range.

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
It's more than I can spend.

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
More than I could spend.

91
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Yeah.

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Okay.

93
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Okay, let's look at her next word, shop around.

94
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Shop around.

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Shop around.

96
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Shop around.

97
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,600
So, she said, I think I'll shop around.

98
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Right.

99
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,800
So, she wants to check in a few other stores to see if there's a better price.

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
If I shop around, I'm going and trying to compare prices maybe.

101
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Exactly.

102
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,520
This is a really good shopping technique.

103
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,880
Yeah, it is.

104
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Yeah.

105
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,240
Okay, and let's look at her last word, pricey.

106
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Pricey.

107
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Pricey.

108
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Pricey.

109
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,960
So, something that's pricey is...

110
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Expensive.

111
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Expensive.

112
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Yep.

113
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,920
This is a more sort of informal way of saying expensive.

114
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Exactly.

115
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,200
So, instead of saying, wow, that car is really expensive.

116
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
It's really pricey.

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
It's really pricey.

118
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Yeah.

119
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,080
Okay, let's listen to our dialogue for the second time and it's going to be slowed down

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
a bit.

121
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,200
So, you'll understand some of these great words a little bit better.

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,040
Hello, may I help you?

123
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,360
How much is it?

125
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,160
That one is $150.

126
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
$150?

127
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,960
What about this other one over here?

128
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
That's $140.

129
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,760
Hmm, that's a bit out of my price range.

130
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,440
Can you give me a better deal?

131
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
This is an exclusive design by Da Marco.

132
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,080
It's a bargain at that price.

133
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,640
Well, I don't know.

134
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,480
I think I'll shop around.

135
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,920
Okay, okay.

136
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,640
How about $100?

137
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,080
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

138
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,720
What if I take both dresses?

139
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
Okay.

140
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,520
I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

141
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
$190 for both.

142
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,200
I don't know.

143
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,840
It's still a bit pricey.

144
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Thanks anyway.

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Okay, my final price.

146
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
$100 for both.

147
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,240
That's two for the price of one.

148
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
That's my last offer.

149
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Great.

150
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,200
You've got a deal.

151
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,560
So we've covered the language in this dialogue.

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Now let's take a look at some of the phrases in Putting It Together.

153
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
Putting It Together.

154
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,920
So Marco, in this dialogue, there's a lot of really useful phrases to help you get a

155
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,440
better price when you shop, right?

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Exactly.

157
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,760
So the first one we have is, can you give me a better deal?

158
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,480
Can you give me a better deal?

159
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Can you give me a better deal?

160
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,720
So if I'm shopping and something is too expensive, I would use this sentence with the shopkeeper.

161
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Yeah.

162
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,760
So you might say, hey, this is out of my price range.

163
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Could you give me a better deal?

164
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
Can you give me a better deal?

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Yeah.

166
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay.

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
We have some examples of can you give me a better deal?

168
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Let's listen.

169
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Example one.

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,560
I really like this shirt, but it's too expensive.

171
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,480
Can you give me a better deal?

172
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,120
Example two.

173
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,040
Can you give me a better price on this car?

174
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,680
I really don't have that much money.

175
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,360
So you can see here that you can say, can you give me a better deal?

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
Or can you give me a better price?

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
All right.

178
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Let's take a look at the next phrase.

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

180
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,440
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

181
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,840
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
So if the seller suggests a really high price, you can say.

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,920
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

184
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,520
So basically, you're telling the shopkeeper.

185
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Still too expensive.

186
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Still too expensive.

187
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
You still don't want to spend that much.

188
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
All right.

189
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Let's take a look at our last phrase.

190
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,720
That's my last offer.

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
That's my last offer.

192
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
That's my last offer.

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Now, this could work both ways.

194
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,140
It could be the shopkeeper that's telling you that.

195
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
That's my lowest price.

196
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Right.

197
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,120
Or you could say, that's my last offer.

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,240
That's my highest price if you are buying it.

199
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Right.

200
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Because sometimes when you're bargaining, the shopkeeper will say, all right, what's

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,880
your best offer?

202
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
How much will you pay?

203
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
A hundred dollars.

204
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,560
That's my final offer.

205
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Exactly.

206
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
All right.

207
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,000
So we've looked at a lot of great phrases and words and now you're ready to bargain

208
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,080
and also listen to this dialogue for the third time.

209
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
And then we'll come back and talk some more.

210
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Hello.

211
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,080
May I help you?

212
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Yeah.

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
This is really nice.

214
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,700
How much is it?

215
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
That one is $150.

216
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
$150?

217
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,200
What about this other one over here?

218
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
That's $140.

219
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
That's a bit out of my price range.

220
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,440
Can you give me a better deal?

221
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,200
This is an exclusive design by Da Marco.

222
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,840
It's a bargain at that price.

223
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,160
Well, I don't know.

224
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,560
I think I'll shop around.

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Okay.

226
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Okay.

227
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
How about $100?

228
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,520
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

229
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,720
What if I take both dresses?

230
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Okay.

231
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,280
I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

232
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,960
$190 for both.

233
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I don't know.

234
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,320
It's still a bit pricey.

235
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Thanks anyway.

236
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay.

237
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
My final price.

238
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
$100 for both.

239
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
That's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

240
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Great.

241
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,920
You caused a deal.

242
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
All right.

243
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,400
In Canada, it's not really common to bargain, right?

244
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
No.

245
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
It really isn't.

246
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,960
Even when you go to the market to buy fruits and vegetables, it's very, very rare to bargain

247
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
with a shopper.

248
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,400
How about in Ecuador?

249
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
No.

250
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
In Ecuador, you definitely bargain.

251
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Really?

252
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,800
Well, if you go to the mall, for example, or if you go to a supermarket, of course,

253
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
you wouldn't really bargain.

254
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,880
Unless maybe you go to a small store or you go to one of the local markets, then it's

255
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,640
more common to bargain.

256
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,240
You have to because people expect you to bargain.

257
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Really?

258
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,120
In many countries in the world, bargaining is almost like an art.

259
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Yeah, that's true.

260
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,080
Actually, Marco, you are an excellent bargainer, aren't you?

261
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Yeah.

262
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,880
I've been known to bargain with the shopkeepers.

263
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,040
I've been known to bargain a little bit with the shopkeepers and helping out.

264
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
A little bit.

265
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,520
I mean, you've got better prices than I can even imagine getting.

266
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Yeah.

267
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
That's a good story.

268
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,920
Maybe we'll get JP to go to our comment section and tell you about that.

269
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Yeah.

270
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
So we want to know about your countries.

271
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,080
Is it common to bargain?

272
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Do you really do it?

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Is it okay?

274
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,360
Or when is it okay?

275
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

276
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Tell us.

277
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Visit our website at EnglishPod.com.

278
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,560
Tell us about your country's bargaining customs and also leave your questions there for us.

279
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Exactly.

280
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
We'll be there to answer them.

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
But until then, we've got to go.

282
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
So, bye.
