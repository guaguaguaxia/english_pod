00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,280
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,640
And today we have a very healthy lesson for everyone.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,560
We are going to have healthy food.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,480
So we're going to the grocery store and we're choosing what food to buy.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,240
You're going to hear a lot of words about eating right and eating healthy.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,080
So let's jump into this dialogue first and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,400
it.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,360
Okay darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs and lots of cheese.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,560
Oh John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Remember?

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Our new healthy lifestyle.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,080
That's all junk food.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Huh.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,200
Right, so what did you get?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,040
Well healthy food, of course.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,840
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish and organic carrots.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Organic?

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
What's organic?

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Do we need organic carrots?

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,400
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,160
And yes John, we need organic carrots.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,320
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,640
Yep, better for the environment and better for us.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,040
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
What's that?

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Donuts?

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,480
But I like donuts.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,600
So it's a very popular topic nowadays.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,520
People want to eat light.

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,400
So why don't we take a look at some of these words and phrases now in Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,600
Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,480
The first kind of food we have here is whole wheat bread.

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,360
So maybe you're buying bread at the grocery store and you see a number of different kinds

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
of bread.

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,560
There's white bread, there's rye bread.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,960
Well we have whole wheat bread which is maybe the healthiest option.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,160
So it's made out of wheat.

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,960
Alright so we have whole wheat bread.

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,400
Now as you say, it's a type of bread that uses wheat as its main ingredient.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,160
Right, so it's made from wheat flour.

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,240
It's usually a brownish kind of bread.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,160
That means the color is brown, not white.

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,280
And it's healthier than white bread because white bread uses that processed flour, right?

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
It does.

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,160
It's processed and also uses a lot more sugar.

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, so whole wheat bread is a healthy option.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,160
And also we are having skimmed milk.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Alright, so as you know when milk comes out of the cow, it's very very fatty.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
There's lots of fat.

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,840
And so skimmed milk means that when the dairy is processing the milk, the fat is taken away.

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,360
So this is one of the healthier kinds of milk.

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,440
You have fat-free and skimmed milk which are the healthiest.

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,800
So when you buy normal milk, what is that called?

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Well you have whole milk.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Whole milk.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,040
And you also have 2% milk which is 2% fat.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
And then skimmed milk and fat-free milk.

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Okay good.

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Now when we were talking about the carrots, she said, you know what, we also bought organic

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,760
carrots.

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,520
So this is a very popular word nowadays.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,160
Organic vegetables, organic carrots.

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
What does it mean if it's organic?

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,200
Well in general, things that are organic come from nature.

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,960
But in food, things that are organic don't use chemicals.

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,040
So a lot of people are very nervous about food that comes from farms that have pesticides

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,620
or chemicals on them.

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,600
But organic food is safe in this area.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,520
There's no pesticides or chemicals.

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Okay.

74
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,160
So what about when you talk about chickens or animals, they also say it's an organic

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,320
farm.

76
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,740
That means that they don't have chemicals injected into them.

77
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
That's right.

78
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,200
They're not stuffed with chemicals or given chemical shots.

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,740
And also the food that they eat is real food.

80
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,400
It's not like chemical food to make them fatter.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay.

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Very good.

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
So organic foods.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,280
And you mentioned the word chemicals a lot.

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,840
So when we talk about chemicals, we're talking about substances that are artificial, right?

86
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
That's right.

87
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,560
They're not organic.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,840
These are things that are chemicals that scientists come up with to help make food.

89
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,820
For example, help make fatter chickens or to make greener vegetables.

90
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,160
And these are not natural.

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
These are man-made.

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,280
And chemicals can also mean pesticides.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,840
So some sprays or things that we put on plants to keep the bugs away.

94
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,200
And these are all things that have been found to hurt human beings.

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,480
I guess, for example, when you are eating something and you see in the box and it says

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,960
it has certain preservatives, those are chemicals, right?

98
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,960
That help keep the food fresh for a longer period of time.

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
That's right.

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Okay.

101
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
So those are chemicals and that's the last word that we have for you on language takeaway.

102
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Four key words here.

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,920
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

104
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Okay darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,120
Oh John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

106
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Remember?

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
Our new healthy lifestyle.

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,600
That's all junk food.

109
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Hmm.

110
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Right.

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
So what did you get?

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
Well, healthy food, of course.

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,280
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Organic?

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
What's organic?

116
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,360
Do we need organic carrots?

117
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,920
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

118
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,720
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

119
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Yep.

121
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Better for the environment and better for us.

122
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
Wait a minute.

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
What's that?

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Donuts?

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,120
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

126
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,480
But I like donuts.

127
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
All right, we're back.

128
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,560
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

129
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,080
This first key phrase is one that I think was very, very common in America in the late

131
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,080
80s, early 1990s.

132
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,320
People in America have been struggling with eating healthy food and not eating so much

133
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
fatty food.

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,800
And so there was an emphasis on eating right.

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
That's right.

136
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
To eat right.

137
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,840
Now, how do you eat right?

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean, it sounds like you want to eat with your spoon correctly.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,880
No, eating right is more about the kind of food you eat.

140
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,360
It's about not eating pizza every day, pizza and hamburgers.

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,720
So we say eating right involves having a balanced diet.

142
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,080
That means eating vegetables and grains and a little bit of meat and not so many sweets

143
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
or oils.

144
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Okay.

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,520
So that's what it means when you are eating right.

146
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,360
So you have to eat right.

147
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,120
That means eating healthy.

148
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Now the opposite, if you're not eating healthy, that's because maybe you're eating too much

149
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
junk food.

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
And that's our next phrase.

151
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Right.

152
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,240
So junk food is junk garbage food.

153
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
It's the kind of food that is very unhealthy for you.

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,760
Potato chips, pizza, ice cream.

155
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,880
It's all the best kind of food.

156
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,120
But it's also the worst for your body.

157
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,360
So we call it junk food.

158
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Okay.

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,160
So everything that's, for example, fast food is usually considered to be junk food.

160
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,680
Yes, it's high in oils and fats.

161
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Okay.

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
So junk food.

163
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,760
And for the last phrase for today.

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,240
What is it?

165
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,320
And for the last phrase, we are starting a healthy lifestyle.

166
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,080
So what does he mean by a healthy lifestyle?

167
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, we don't say life.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,680
We say lifestyle because this is the way in which a person lives.

169
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
It's your lifestyle.

170
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Okay.

171
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:57,160
So this involves exercise, diet, what kind of food you eat, the way that you work.

172
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,460
Do you get too much sleep?

173
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
Not enough sleep.

174
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,080
So your lifestyle is about the choices you make in all parts of your life.

175
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,040
And so having a healthy lifestyle, as I said, it's not just about not eating junk food.

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,120
It's about running five miles or trying to get eight hours of sleep.

177
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,320
So it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

178
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,880
And usually in the news, we always hear, so usually in the news, we hear this phrase,

179
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,120
not healthy life, but healthy lifestyle.

180
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,440
So maybe somebody that leads a dangerous lifestyle maybe has a job that's very dangerous.

181
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
That's right.

182
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,600
Or an unhealthy lifestyle, someone who eats one meal a day.

183
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay.

184
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Very good.

185
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,840
So those are key phrases for fluency builder.

186
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,880
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk

187
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,440
with you a little bit more.

188
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:56,080
Okay, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

189
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,280
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

190
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,120
Remember our new healthy lifestyle.

191
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
That's all junk food.

192
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Huh?

193
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Right.

194
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
So what did you get?

195
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,760
Well, healthy food, of course.

196
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,560
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

197
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Organic?

198
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
What's organic?

199
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Do we need organic carrots?

200
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,160
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

201
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,920
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

202
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,080
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

203
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Yep.

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,400
They're good for the environment and better for us.

205
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,760
Wait a minute.

206
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
What's that?

207
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Donuts?

208
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,280
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

209
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,520
But I like donuts.

210
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,000
Alright, we're back.

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,600
So talking about healthy food and healthy eating, how healthy do you eat, Katherine?

212
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,960
I think I eat pretty decently.

213
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
I try to eat a balanced diet.

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,080
Like I said earlier, I think a balanced diet is a key to a healthy lifestyle.

215
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,320
I don't really eat fast food.

216
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,140
I try not to eat too much meat or too much sugar.

217
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
What about organic stuff?

218
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,400
Are you a big fan of organic vegetables, organic meats?

219
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I am.

220
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,620
And this comes from a part of the dialogue we didn't cover.

221
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,920
One of the characters says that vegetables are the green option.

222
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,360
So trying to eat organic food and think about green is a part of thinking about the environment.

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,360
And so I think eating organic vegetables is an important part of caring about the environment

224
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,400
because the more chemicals, the more pesticides we put into the world, the more harmful it

225
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,000
is for the earth, for animals and for ourselves.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, that's absolutely true.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,880
And it has become a more popular aspect around America and Europe, people choosing to go

228
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,640
with organic vegetables, for example, eggs that were grown on an organic farm.

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,880
And so it is the healthier option and obviously the green option as we saw in the dialogue.

230
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,280
Okay, so a very interesting topic.

231
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,240
