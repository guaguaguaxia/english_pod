00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,680
My name is Catherine and today we have another holiday lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,000
It's an intermediate level lesson, but it's not about Christmas and it's not about New

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Year's.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So what's this holiday, Marco?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
It's like after Christmas, but before New Year's.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,640
Okay, so let's look at this holiday in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
All right, so as you noticed in the title, this is called Boxing Day.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,320
So like fighting boxing or...

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
No, no, no.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,400
Kind of like boxes, right?

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,960
It's more related to boxes.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Exactly.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,840
So this is a holiday that we don't actually celebrate in America.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,840
It's celebrated in what are called Commonwealth countries.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
That means countries that used to be a part of Great Britain or that are a part of Great

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,760
Britain.

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,120
So England, Scotland, Canada, Australia.

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,840
And this is a day where, well, it's considered a holiday because it's a bank holiday.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,460
That means all the banks close.

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,460
No one's at work.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,960
It's the day after Christmas.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,600
So it's December 26th and it's traditionally a day when you give money or gifts to the

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
poor.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Okay.

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,480
And so this is more or less what we're going to be talking about, but more modern, right?

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,200
Before it was like that, but now it's kind of become this shopping thing, right?

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
It has.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,920
It's a day when everyone goes to the sales after Christmas to return things or to buy

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,560
new things.

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,640
So we're going to hear about this right away in today's dialogue.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
And when we come back, we'll be talking about some of the phrases and words that you've

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:39,360
heard.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
What do you think of this one?

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Eh, so-so.

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
And this one?

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Too flashy?

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Nah, not too flashy.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,920
Oh, and this sweater from my aunt.

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Isn't it hideous?

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
I guess.

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Are you even listening?

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,200
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,480
I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,040
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick?

50
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,000
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, your precious game.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,920
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
least three goals.

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,420
Oh, no you didn't.

55
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,440
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
are over?

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
I might just.

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Enjoy your stupid game.

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
And Merry Christmas.

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Merry Christmas.

62
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:45,160
Alright, great, so we're back and interesting, the couple fighting right after Christmas.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,800
Well I think it's very common to hear fights around the holidays.

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
People are very stressed out.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,000
And tired of dealing with family and presents and all the stress, right?

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Exactly.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
But we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,800
Right now why don't we take a look at four key words in language takeaway.

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,120
Language takeaway.

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,800
Okay, these first two words are words that the wife uses in talking about some of these

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,620
clothes that she got as presents.

72
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,560
So she says, well she asks her husband, is this too flashy?

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Flashy.

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,960
Alright, so you know flash, like the camera flash, right?

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,280
This big light.

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,840
Now flashy when you're talking about clothes or an object, it's too noticeable, right?

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,760
It's too noticeable, too bright, too loud.

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,680
So for example, a black shirt is not flashy.

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,320
But an orange shirt.

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:50,120
An orange shirt with buttons and bells and rhinestones, diamonds, that's flashy.

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,240
She can also mean something that is supposed to look expensive.

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,280
Okay, so that sweater was a little bit flashy according to her.

83
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,760
But also she talked about another sweater being hideous.

84
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,520
So hideous is an ugly word and it means ugly.

85
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Ugly.

86
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,240
Okay, so I could say this sweater is hideous.

87
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,160
That means it's not only ugly, it's really ugly.

88
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Okay, it's more than ugly.

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,520
Alright, a hideous sweater.

90
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,360
And moving on, the guy now was a little bit irritated and stressed out and he said, you

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,280
keep yapping on about your new clothes.

92
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,640
So what is this yapping on?

93
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,760
Well, yap is a sound like yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,640
So yapping, to yap on about means to continue to talk and talk and talk about something.

95
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,600
Because he's watching the football game on TV and she's talking and talking and talking

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
and he's annoyed.

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,680
So this is rude to say, stop yapping about this or stop yapping on about your game.

98
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
It's very rude.

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
It means just stop talking.

100
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
I'm annoyed.

101
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,840
And well, then he mentioned another phrase that is pretty much the same thing, right?

102
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,160
Blabbering on.

103
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,600
To blabber, to blabber on about means to talk about something but to not really make sense.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,800
Okay, so it's just worthless talk.

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
So you're just talking to talk.

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,040
You're not really saying anything interesting.

107
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Exactly.

108
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,480
And so sometimes we make fun of people who blabber on about things because they're not

109
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,160
important to us or they sound stupid.

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
All right.

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay, so four key words there.

112
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,840
Blabbering on, yapping on.

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,520
Why don't we listen to them again in the dialogue?

114
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
What do you think of this one?

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Eh, so-so.

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,240
And this one?

117
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Too flashy?

118
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,800
Nah, not too flashy.

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,760
Oh, and this sweater from my aunt, isn't it hideous?

120
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
I guess.

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Are you even listening?

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,920
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

124
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,040
I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

126
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,200
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,160
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

128
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,180
Oh, your precious game.

129
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,120
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
least three goals.

131
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
Oh, no you didn't.

132
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

133
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,640
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales

134
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
are over?

135
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
I might just.

136
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,040
Enjoy your stupid game.

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
And Merry Christmas.

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Merry Christmas.

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,720
All right, we're back.

140
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,800
So now we have a couple of different phrases that we want to look at on Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,720
Okay, so this first phrase is very closely related to the days after Christmas, especially

143
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,640
here on Boxing Day.

144
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,680
We've got someone who's talking about going to the stores, to the sales to exchange her

145
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,880
gifts for better gifts.

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,940
Okay, to exchange something for something better.

147
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,560
This is a very common construction.

148
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,260
It's an important phrase when talking about shopping.

149
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,400
So when we look at this construction, you would say, to exchange this sweater for a

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
better one or for a larger one.

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Exactly.

152
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
So you can change the adjective, the word that's describing it.

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,640
So you can say, to exchange these shoes for bigger ones.

154
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,800
I could also joke and I could say, I'm going to exchange my boyfriend for a better one

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
if he's being rude to me.

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay, so to exchange something for something else.

157
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Exactly.

158
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
All right.

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,480
And then we saw another phrase that the husband replied to when she offended him with his

160
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
football team.

161
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,920
He said, oh no, you didn't.

162
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Didn't what?

163
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I know, didn't what?

164
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
No, you didn't what?

165
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,080
All right, so this, like you said, doesn't make sense alone, but some cultural context

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
might help.

167
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,480
In English, we often say this phrase to mean, oh no, you didn't just say that.

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,880
Oh, you didn't just insult my team.

169
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,720
He's saying, I can't believe you just said that.

170
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,560
He's upset because what she said was rude or mean.

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Okay.

172
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,480
So I could say, you know, Marco, I think Ecuador sucks.

173
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Oh, no, you didn't.

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,320
I did just say, I don't think so actually, but it's usually a response, right?

175
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,560
You have to wait until somebody maybe says something mean or something that, you know,

176
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,280
really hurts her feelings or you don't agree with when you respond to this, but you're

177
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
usually very, very offended, right?

178
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Exactly.

179
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,040
It's always a response to a comment that has made you angry or upset.

180
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Okay.

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,280
And then our last phrase is when they finished talking and they were fighting, she left and

182
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,320
said, I might just.

183
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Just what?

184
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I know, just what?

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,040
See, again, these are common phrases, but they don't seem to make much sense alone.

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
I might just.

187
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,840
So let's listen to, this is a response again.

188
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,520
This is a response to the line before it.

189
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,600
Why don't you just, just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back

190
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,440
until much later?

191
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,760
And she says, I might just, I might just do exactly what you just said.

192
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Okay.

193
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
She's threatening him.

194
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,280
She's saying, I might just go out and not come back for 10 hours.

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
All right.

196
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
I might just do that.

197
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Okay.

198
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,680
So that's a way to say what you said.

199
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
I might do that.

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
And I'm threatening you.

201
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,920
So again, it's usually a response, right?

202
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,240
Or a threat, as you said.

203
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,600
So I can say, Marco, why don't you just leave?

204
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
All right.

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I might just.

206
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Oh, what am I going to do in the studio alone?

207
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
All right.

208
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,880
So three interesting phrases there.

209
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:48,320
Why don't we listen to all the words and phrases again in our dialogue one last time.

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
What do you think of this one?

211
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
Eh, so-so.

212
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
And this one?

213
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Too flashy?

214
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Nah, not too flashy.

215
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh, and this sweater from my aunt, isn't it hideous?

216
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I guess.

217
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Are you even listening?

218
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

219
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,600
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,520
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when

221
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,760
I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

222
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,960
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

223
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,920
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

224
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Oh, your precious game.

225
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,840
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at

226
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
least three goals.

227
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,340
Oh, no you didn't.

228
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,000
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales

230
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
are over?

231
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I might just.

232
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,800
Enjoy your stupid game.

233
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
And Merry Christmas.

234
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Merry Christmas.

235
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:50,480
All right, we're back.

236
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
So Boxing Day, as you said, is usually a Commonwealth thing.

237
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
In the United States, you don't really have it, right?

238
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
We do not.

239
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,800
My family, I don't know why, but my family sometimes celebrates that we have friends

240
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,480
who come over and we have a nice Boxing Day meal.

241
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,120
But I've been told that the tradition in Commonwealth countries is to watch sporting events, local

242
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,480
sporting events, and to go shopping for all these sales and bargains and exchange all

243
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,400
those ugly, hideous, annoying or bad gifts that you received at Christmas.

244
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Right.

245
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,880
So it's usually like the after Christmas sales.

246
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Exactly.

247
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,960
So if you have any special Boxing Day traditions, I'd be very curious to hear them.

248
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,440
Again, not a holiday related to the sport boxing.

249
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,480
It's spelled the same way and it looks the same, but they're very different.

250
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,640
So if you have any stories or questions about the things that we talked about today, please

251
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,160
do let us know on our website EnglishPod.com.

252
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
All right.

253
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,640
We'll see you guys there and until next time.

254
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Bye everyone.

255
00:11:45,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Happy Boxing.
