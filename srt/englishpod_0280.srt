00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,800
My name is Catherine and today's show is a continuation of our series about giving a

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,200
presentation in English.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,360
So we're talking about a special line of computers here.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,960
That's right and on this occasion we're going to compare two companies.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,560
So we're going to try to tell everyone what the difference is between our company and

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
the competitors.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,560
All right, so we learned a lot of great phrases and words for making comparisons in last week's

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
show.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,840
You're going to hear some of these again.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Let's listen to the dialogue.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,880
Now of course with all this cutting edge technology there must be a catch, you might ask yourself.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,400
I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers you might say.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Well you'd be wrong.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,340
Yes of course the X420 is aimed at the luxury market but if you compare the price of our

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,120
leading competitors the X420 represents incredible value for money.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,040
At only 15,000 RMB it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,480
leading brand and model.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,880
So what differentiates us from our competitors?

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,320
Well if we compare Orange's luxury MP40 range then we can really highlight some of the differences.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,040
Now of course Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,920
products and I must admit the MP40 is a breathtaking machine.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,040
However for most consumers the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,760
Compared with the X420 it is more expensive and there's no doubt that considering the

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,360
quality and workmanship that goes into the X420 we really win hands down on value for

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,760
money.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,540
Also if you compare the after sales service we offer I think we can proudly boast the

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,160
best customer service facilities in the whole laptop sector.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,200
As opposed to most of our rivals we guarantee quality, we guarantee service and we guarantee

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,240
reliability.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,320
The questions we must ask ourselves are what does the Alpha brand stand for and also how

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,680
can we set ourselves apart from our competitors?

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,160
The answer to both of these questions is the same my friends.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,080
Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence and for service.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,640
If we always stick to this philosophy then I'm confident that we will really be able

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,720
to expand our market share significantly.

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:32,480
Okay let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the X420.

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at these phrases on Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,880
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,740
Our first phrase comes from the very first sentence of today's dialogue.

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,080
We heard this phrase cutting edge technology.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,320
Now Marco what does cutting edge mean?

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,440
Okay so as you see in the dialogue we're talking about technology and if technology is cutting

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,480
edge, it basically means it's new, it's very modern, it's the newest you can get.

46
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,000
It's the most advanced perhaps.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,720
So what's an example of a current cutting edge technology?

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Can you think of something?

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,960
So for example when we talk about mobile phones that can now connect to the internet, you

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,760
can send emails, they have many features even two cameras and touch sensitive screens.

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
This is a type of cutting edge technology.

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,240
Okay it's the most new technology, the newest.

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
That's right.

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,440
So after that we heard another phrase, this is a bit different, this is more of a business

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
phrase.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
We have this retail price.

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,580
I bet the retail price will be too much.

59
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,280
So what is a retail price and how is it different from a regular price?

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,840
So the retail price is basically the amount of money that you pay for something at the

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
store.

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Exactly.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,820
So if I go to a store and I buy a computer for $1000, I know that the store, they bought

64
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,280
the computer for less money.

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,760
Otherwise they don't earn any money, it's a bad business.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
That's right.

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,160
So the retail price is higher than the actual price, the cost of production.

68
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,620
So retail price just basically means exactly what you said Marco, how much you would spend

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,980
on something, how much something costs in a store.

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,680
That's right, that's why they're called retail stores.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Exactly.

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,440
Now moving on, when we're discussing the X420, this computer, Mr. Ford says that it's aimed

73
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
at the luxury market.

74
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,540
That means that this company would like to sell the computer in the luxury market.

75
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,680
The luxury market is not the normal market.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,480
It's the market for very expensive, very beautiful, very nice things.

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Luxury items, luxury brands are very, very expensive.

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
That's right.

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,040
So for example, a car such as a Mercedes Benz might be aimed at the luxury market, whereas

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,480
a car like a Honda Civic is aimed at maybe more of a middle class market.

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Exactly.

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Or in clothing, you could say Gucci is a luxury brand, whereas the Gap or something is a regular

83
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,000
consumer brand.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
So this is what we talk about when we refer to a luxury market.

86
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Now moving on to the description of the X420, Mr. Ford says that it's amazing quality and

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,060
that the workmanship is very, very good.

88
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,320
So workmanship is related to the word work.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,280
And now workmanship means how something is made.

90
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,240
Generally when we talk about luxury goods, we expect the workmanship to be very, very

91
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
high quality.

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,800
So that means that the way that these things are made is the best.

93
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
That's right.

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
It's not going to break in one day.

95
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,680
Usually I think when you talk about workmanship or luxury items like this, maybe part of it

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,320
is made by hand.

97
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,640
So this is what we talk about workmanship is how skilled that person is or how skilled

98
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,760
his hands are to make this great piece of luxury good.

99
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Exactly.

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,960
So a very good example in the world of music is the Stradivarius violin.

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,200
The Stradivarius violins are very, very expensive because the workmanship is the best quality

102
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,160
in the history of world music.

103
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
That's right.

104
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Very good.

105
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,560
So that's what we talk about workmanship.

106
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
You can apply it to many different things.

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,360
But moving on to our last word for language takeaway today, another nice business phrase

108
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,920
that we talk about specifically in sales is market share.

109
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,560
Now Marco, describe to me market share because I know what a market is.

110
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
It's where things are bought and sold.

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,240
But what is a share, market share?

112
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,780
So in this case, we're talking about computers.

113
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,600
So a market share is how much a company owns in the market or how much they sell in this

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
market.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,800
So for example, if we have a city of a thousand people and everyone there buys computers,

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,160
if we sell computers to 500 people of that city, that means we own a 50% market share.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Okay.

118
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,840
So a market share is usually like a percentage, right?

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,640
It's a piece of this big pie.

120
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
That's right.

121
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,640
So everyone is always fighting for more market share.

122
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,160
Whoever sells more has bigger market share.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,960
So in the world of televisions, would you say that Sony has a large market share in

124
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
televisions?

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,800
Probably, although I think maybe Samsung has a bigger market share or LG.

126
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I don't know.

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
See, this is the thing with market shares is that there are so many brands in a certain

128
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,240
industry that everyone has maybe a little piece of the pie or maybe one has a bigger

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
piece.

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
I see.

131
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
All right.

132
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Well, that's it for Language Takeaway.

133
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I hope you guys have learned something there.

134
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:52,040
We're going to be back in a moment with Fluency Builder.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,120
Now of course, with all this cutting edge technology, there must be a catch, you might

136
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
ask yourself.

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,880
I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might say.

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,280
Well, you'd be wrong.

139
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,040
Yes, of course, the X420 is aimed at the luxury market.

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,560
But if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the X420 represents incredible

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
value for money.

142
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,000
At only 15,000 RMB, it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,440
leading brand and model.

144
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,280
So what differentiates us from our competitors?

145
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Well, if we compare Orange's luxury MP40 range, then we can really highlight some of the differences.

However, for most consumers, the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.

149
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,720
Compared with the X420, it is more expensive and there's no doubt that considering the

150
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,400
quality and workmanship that goes into the X420, we really win hands down on value for

151
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
money.

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,480
Also, if you compare the after sales service we offer, I think we can proudly boast the

153
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,120
best customer service facilities in the whole laptop sector.

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,360
As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service and we guarantee

155
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,200
reliability.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,280
The questions we must ask ourselves are, what does the Alpha brand stand for and also, how

157
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,640
can we set ourselves apart from our competitors?

158
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,120
The answer to both of these questions is the same my friends.

159
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,040
Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence and for service.

160
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,600
If we always stick to this philosophy, then I'm confident that we will really be able

161
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,240
to expand our market share significantly.

162
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,280
Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the X420.

163
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,960
Alright, we're back.

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,600
So now, let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

165
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,200
So the first phrase I would like to look at on Fluency Builder is very important for consumers.

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,760
That means people who buy things are very interested in this thing.

167
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,880
We call it value for money.

168
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
That's right.

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,880
When Mr. Ford was talking about the X420, he said it represents incredible value for

170
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,280
money at only 15,000 RMB.

171
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,040
Okay, so 15,000 RMB sounds like a lot of money to me.

172
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,240
But he's saying that the value of the product is very good considering the price.

173
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
That's right.

174
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,200
So what do you think the phrase value for money is?

175
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,920
As you said, the quality and how much you are getting for this product compared to how

176
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,880
much you're paying for it is very, very good.

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,800
So the idea is it should be more expensive.

178
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
That's right.

179
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
But it's not.

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,840
So the value considering the price is actually very good.

181
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,720
So maybe I could say that this computer, this Apple computer, it's expensive.

182
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
It's $1,500.

183
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,120
But the value for money is great because I'll have this computer for five years.

184
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,640
Another computer might break and I have to buy a new one.

185
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,240
And also you can describe value for money as something good or bad.

186
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,880
For example, the same computer you can say doesn't represent good value for money.

187
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,120
So maybe you paid more than what you're actually getting.

188
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
There was a bad deal.

189
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
There was a bad deal.

190
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
That's right.

191
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Great.

192
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
Well, the next phrase is an interesting one.

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,040
It's in this sentence where we talked about workmanship.

194
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,720
So Mr. Forbes described the X420 and he said it really wins hands down on value for money.

195
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
That's right.

196
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,580
So the phrase that we're going to take a look at is hands down.

197
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,560
So what does he mean when he says that workmanship for the X420 wins hands down?

198
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,600
So this is a very spoken English phrase and it has nothing to do with your hands.

199
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,920
It means, well, I guess it could, hands down.

200
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm not really sure what the literal meaning is.

201
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,360
But when we say it, we mean that something is without competition.

202
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,720
So there is no doubt in my mind.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,680
This is absolutely the best in value for money.

204
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,280
And so maybe if I say, oh, well, there are two or three computers.

205
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,040
They're all nice.

206
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
Nothing is hands down.

207
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,060
But if I say, listen, this IBM computer is hands down the best on the market.

208
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,560
That means there's no other competition.

209
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,140
It is the best.

210
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,760
So you can't really argue with that.

211
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
It's the best, no arguments there.

212
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,320
No arguments, exactly.

213
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Hands down.

214
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,880
He is hands down the best baseball player I've ever seen.

215
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
Okay, very good.

216
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
Okay, so now moving on to our next phrase.

217
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,800
When Mr. Ford again was talking about now the company, he said that the Alpha brand

218
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,400
is what does it stand for?

219
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,760
And he said that it stands first and foremost for quality.

220
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,320
Okay, so this means you think about first and foremost.

221
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,040
This means above everything else.

222
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,280
So Alpha means a lot of things.

223
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
They make good computers.

224
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,240
They're a strong company.

225
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,440
But first and foremost, it means quality.

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,160
It means that more important than any other thing that Alpha brand does, quality is the

227
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
most important.

228
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay, so basically what we're saying the first thing and the most important thing is quality.

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,920
So that's what you mean when you say first and foremost.

230
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,240
So you can say for example, when I'm looking for a car, price is the first and foremost

231
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
important quality.

232
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay, so we're talking about, you know, for Marco, the most important factor, the most

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,920
important part of buying a car is the price.

234
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,020
That's right.

235
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,080
So moving on to our last phrase now, when Mr. Ford was ending this part of his speech,

236
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,420
he said that we always stick to this philosophy.

237
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,700
To stick to.

238
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,160
So stick is a verb and a noun, if you're familiar with the noun, it's different from what we're

239
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,360
talking about today.

240
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,120
To stick to, remember that as a phrase, to stick to something.

241
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,720
So to stick to means to continue doing it.

242
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,440
Okay, you're going to hear this a lot when you talk about sports or even in the office.

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,840
I could say, listen, Marco, I don't want you to quit.

244
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,520
I really want you to stick to this project.

245
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,600
Okay, so to continue doing, to not give up.

246
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,840
Don't give up, right.

247
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,960
So you could say this to a child also, you know, I know you want to quit playing soccer,

248
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,240
but I think you should stick to it.

249
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,520
To stick to it.

250
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,880
That means to continue playing, not to quit.

251
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
Okay, very good.

252
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,260
So it's a very nice and maybe spoken English phrase, which means continue doing, to not

253
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,080
give up, to be persuasive.

254
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
Right, to stick to something.

255
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,260
I want to stick to it.

256
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,840
You should stick to this.

257
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,320
Okay, very good.

258
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,760
So a lot of phrases here.

259
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,600
I think we've taken a look at a lot of things here.

260
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,840
Maybe we should go back.

261
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:45,920
Let's review one last time the dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

262
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,880
Now of course, with all this cutting edge technology, there must be a catch.

263
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,280
You might ask yourself, I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might

264
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
say.

265
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Well, you'd be wrong.

266
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,940
Yes, of course, the X420 is aimed at the luxury market.

267
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,440
But if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the X420 represents incredible

268
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,980
value for money.

269
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,880
At only 15,000 RMB, it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every

270
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,320
leading brand and model.

271
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,120
So what differentiates us from our competitors?

272
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,160
Well, if we compare Orange's luxury MP40 range, then we can really highlight some of the differences.

273
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,080
Now of course, Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class

274
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,240
products.

275
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,560
And I must admit, the MP40 is a breathtaking machine.

276
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,880
However, for most consumers, the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.

277
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,620
Compared with the X420, it is more expensive and there's no doubt that considering the

278
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,200
quality and workmanship that goes into the X420, we really win hands down on value for

279
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
money.

280
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Also, if you compare the after sales service we offer, I think we can proudly boast the

281
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,020
best customer service facilities in the whole laptop sector.

282
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,280
As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service, and we guarantee

283
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,080
reliability.

284
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,360
The questions we must ask ourselves are, what does the Alpha brand stand for?

285
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,520
And also, how can we set ourselves apart from our competitors?

286
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,000
The answer to both of these questions is the same, my friends.

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,920
Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence, and for service.

288
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,500
If we always stick to this philosophy, then I'm confident that we will really be able

289
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,120
to expand our market share significantly.

290
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:40,360
Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the X420.

291
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Alright so that's all the time we have for today on this series.

292
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,280
Be sure to check out the next part next week where we're going to continue talking about

293
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,960
presentations and as you can see it's very business oriented but you can apply everything

294
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,200
that you learn to other situations as well.

295
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,360
Exactly, these phrases like hands down and to stick to, these aren't business phrases,

296
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,640
these are words you can use in business but I use these in my everyday life and I think

297
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,160
that with a little bit of practice you guys can sound really, really fluent in English

298
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,600
and these phrases are a good place to start.

299
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
That's right.

300
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,960
So if you have any questions, any doubts or comments, you can visit our website EnglishPod.com

301
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,640

See you guys soon.

303
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Bye.

304
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,140
Okay that was great.
