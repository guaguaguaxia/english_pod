00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,240
My name is Catherine and we're going shopping today at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,240
That's right.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,260
Today we are going to the store because we want to return a product.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,240
So maybe the product that we bought had some problem and we want our money back.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
That's right.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,360
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk more

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,000
about what's going on.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Hi, I would like to return this TV.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,960
Sure, do you have a receipt?

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
Yeah, here you go.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,760
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,040
Okay.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,800
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,000
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,160
I see.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,600
And what about the keyboard?

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,560
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm sorry ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,640
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Fine.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,600
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,360
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,240
So now let's take a look at some of those key words on Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,400
So we've got a great bunch of words for you here today.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,880
The first three are nouns and then afterwards we've got a couple of adjectives to describe

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
those nouns.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
But first up, we have the word receipt.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
That's right.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,200
So we want to return the television and the worker there asks us if we have the receipt.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,280
Okay, a receipt is a small piece of paper that you receive from a clerk or a server

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,160
after you buy something.

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,160
So if I buy a TV, I will have this small piece of paper that says that I paid $500 for the

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
TV.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
That's right.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,240
So usually they will ask you for the receipt to see when you bought the product and if

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,800
you bought the product at that store.

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
That's right.

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,240
So the receipt has all sorts of information, date, time, method of payment, cost, all those

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
things.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Right.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,040
And it's very important if you ever want to return something.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,600
Now later on in the dialogue, the character explains why he wants to return the TV.

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,040
Now Marco, why does he want to do that?

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,680
Well, he has a problem with the TV when he's watching a movie.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,200
Basically the image is not very clear.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,480
So this is the keyword image.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,520
So image can mean a couple of different things.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,960
You might hear the word image to mean a photograph or a picture like on a computer.

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,280
But in this case, the image is how well you can see the images on TV, the things on TV.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
That's right.

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,920
So on TV, it's like you're seeing many, many images all at once or very rapidly together.

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,120
So maybe if you can't see clearly, you say that the image is not clear on the TV.

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
All right.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,520
So if it's fuzzy, like there's gray and black, the image is not clear.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,400
You can also say that, you know, I really like my new TV.

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,240
The image is very clear.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
That's right.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Okay.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,560
And not only are we returning a TV, but we're also returning a keyboard.

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,680
All right.

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,600
A keyboard, a key is something that you can push.

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,560
But a keyboard is this thing that you use with your computer to type words.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
That's right.

66
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,820
So many of you who are using the website as we speak are using a keyboard and a mouse.

67
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,120
So these are probably one of the two most well-known objects when you're using a computer.

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
That's right.

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
And keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,020
You can buy French keyboards and Russian keyboards.

71
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,480
So keyboard is the general word for this tool.

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,520
Okay.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,840
So we are returning the keyboard and the clerk explains that we can only return it if it

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,040
is defective, if the product is defective.

75
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
All right.

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,560
So this is one of those adjectives I talked about a minute ago.

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,760
Adjectives describe things.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,100
So my keyboard is defective or this TV is defective.

79
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,240
That means it doesn't work.

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
That's right.

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,760
So we have a defective product.

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,280
It's not working properly.

83
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,420
It has some problem.

84
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,200
And well, the guy was complaining that he didn't understand why these things like the

85
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,960
keyboard are so delicate.

86
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,620
All right.

87
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,320
Delicate is something you might see written on the side of a box when you receive a package.

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,400
Something that is delicate breaks very easily.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
That's right.

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,760
So you have to handle with care.

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,960
So for example, glass is very delicate.

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
It can break easily.

93
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
All right.

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Glass is delicate but stones, a big rock, that's not delicate.

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
That's right.

96
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
All right.

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
So that's all we have for language takeaway.

98
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,400
Let's review everything and listen to our dialogue.

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,200
Hi.

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
I would like to return this TV.

101
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Sure.

102
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Do you have a receipt?

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Yeah.

104
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Here you go.

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,240
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

106
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Okay.

107
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,360
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

108
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,560
The TV flickers a lot when I'm watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

109
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,720
I see.

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,200
And what about the keyboard?

111
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,120
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,240
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

114
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Fine.

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,920
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
All right.

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,760
We're back.

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,240
So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we've picked out for to be exact on Fluency

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,000
Builder.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,880
Fluency Builder.

121
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,520
The first verb we have today here in Fluency Builder is the main verb in today's dialogue,

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
to return.

123
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,920
So I would like to return this TV.

124
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Okay.

125
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,440
So when you want to give back a product, you don't say I want to give back or anything

126
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
like this.

127
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,360
You say I want to return this product.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Well, it's not just giving back.

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,920
It's giving back and getting your money back.

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
That's right.

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,720
So to return means that you bring back the product and the store will give you back your

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
money.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
That's right.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,960
And he wanted to return the TV as we mentioned because the image was not very clear, but

135
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,600
he also mentioned that the TV flickers a lot.

136
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
So what is this to flicker?

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,640
To flicker is another verb and flicker is something that things with light do.

138
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,040
The light flickers, the TV flickers.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,160
It means the light comes on and off, on and off, on and off.

140
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,800
So dark light, dark light.

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
It's not very steady.

142
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,140
It's not like there's a light or dark.

143
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,440
And so this is very annoying when you're watching TV because it goes light, dark, light, dark

144
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
and it's hard to see what's happening.

145
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Exactly.

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,600
So it's basically just imagine someone is turning on and off the light all the time.

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,560
That's the same thing that's happening with the TV.

148
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
It flickers.

149
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Exactly.

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,520
Or like when a light bulb in your lamp, when a light bulb is dying, it flickers.

151
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
That's right.

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
All right.

153
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,200
So we wanted to actually return these goods and the clerk explained that we can exchange

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,080
or we can refund defective products.

155
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Okay.

156
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,520
These are two important verbs.

157
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,760
Exchange means to trade one thing for another.

158
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,960
So when I go to a foreign country, I exchange money, right?

159
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
I can exchange Japanese yen for American dollars.

160
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,560
But at a store like an electronic store, I can exchange my TV that I don't like for maybe

161
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,620
a really good MP3 player or something like that.

162
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,680
So that's what happens usually if maybe your TV is broken or it had some problem, you exchange

163
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,040
it for a new one, right?

164
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,100
But maybe you don't want the TV anymore.

165
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,240
Maybe you changed your mind.

166
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,360
So you want to get a refund.

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,000
So refund, you hear this word fund, it has to do with money.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,720
A refund means that the store will give you all your money back.

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,620
So if I refund my TV, I give my TV to the store, the store gives me $500 or whatever

170
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,680
the money for the TV was, and I can buy anything else anywhere else.

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
That's right.

172
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,680
So this is what happens when you get a refund, very different from exchanging the goods.

173
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,360
And finally, the clerk explained that they cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,040
So remember this as a phrase.

175
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,300
This is really important to take responsibility.

176
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,200
It means that if something goes wrong, you will take responsibility for it.

177
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,760
You will handle it.

178
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
All right.

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,680
So for example, the store says that it can't take responsibility if something is broken.

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,360
That means that they won't pay you back money.

181
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
That's right.

182
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
So if you buy a TV and you accidentally get it wet or you get water inside and this is

183
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,440
why it gets damaged, then the store cannot take responsibility for this damage.

184
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
Or you could say the other way around.

185
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,560
You could say, if you're at the office and you make a mistake on a report, you say, listen,

186
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,640
boss, I'm really sorry.

187
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,100
I take full responsibility for this mistake.

188
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,880
You can punish me or you can make me do it again.

189
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,960
But I take responsibility means that I say it's my fault.

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Right.

191
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
You're guilty.

192
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
All right.

193
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
So that's all we have for Fluency Builder.

194
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we can review everything we've just learned.

195
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,040
Hi, I would like to return this TV.

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,160
Sure.

197
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Do you have a receipt?

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Yeah.

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Here you go.

200
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

201
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
OK.

202
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,080
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

203
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,280
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

204
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,440
I see.

205
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,920
And what about the keyboard?

206
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,800
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

207
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

208
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,960
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

209
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Fine.

210
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:27,360
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

211
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,280
So returning goods is a very useful thing if you maybe bought a TV at a department store

212
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,080
or an electronic store, then you would want to return it if you had some problems.

213
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Now, how easy or difficult is it to do?

214
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,440
Because in theory, in the dialogue, it seems like it's really easy.

215
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
It depends on the store, of course.

216
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,680
Some stores make it easier to do this.

217
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Some stores make it harder.

218
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,400
I can tell you in most stores, if you don't have a receipt, it's probably very difficult.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Really?

220
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Yes.

221
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,120
But a lot of stores have something else that they sell you or give you when you buy something.

222
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,720
It's called a warranty.

223
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,160
And this is something that will help protect you if you take the TV home and you have a

224
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
problem.

225
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Right.

226
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
That means that they will come fix it or they will give you a new one without any questions

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,720
about what happened.

228
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,880
Now, not only can you return goods such as TVs, electronics or maybe clothes, but in

229
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,560
some cases also things that you buy at the supermarket, like maybe chicken.

230
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,480
I've heard that maybe sometimes you buy chicken and you open it up that same day and it's

231
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
gone bad.

232
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Really?

233
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I've never had that experience, but I think it makes sense.

234
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
It depends where you buy it, of course.

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Right.

236
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,640
Obviously at a supermarket and you show the receipt or maybe milk.

237
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,760
Maybe that's gone bad sometimes or yogurt.

238
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,840
Well, because they probably shouldn't sell it if it's bad.

239
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Exactly.

240
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,760
If you tell them that they sold you bad milk, they'll give you a new one.

241
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Exactly.

242
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,080
So that's called an exchange.

243
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,720
You would exchange the bad one for the good one.

244
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Right.

245
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
You wouldn't get your money back.

246
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
No.

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Maybe, maybe not.

248
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Maybe.

249
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
All right.

250
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,040
So that's all the time we have for today, but this is actually a very interesting topic

251
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,960
because it has to do a lot with customer service.

252
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,360
So let us know what your experience is with customer service, with returning something.

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,480
Is it very easy?

254
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,800
Very difficult?

255
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,760
Actually some stores don't even accept returns.

256
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
They say once you buy it, you cannot return it.

257
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
All sales final.

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Yeah, exactly.

259
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,600
So let us know.

260
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,920
Are refunds or exchanges common where you come from?

261
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,360
And have you ever had a bad experience where you bought something and it didn't work when

262
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
you got home?

263
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Let us know.

264
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

265
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
All right.

266
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
We'll see you guys there.

267
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:48,640
Thanks again.
