00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello, English Litters.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,440
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,160
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,360
We're bringing you a great elementary podcast today.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
That's right.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,320
And we're going to be teaching you how to order pizza.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, you know, pizza is one of my favorite foods and the favorite food of many people.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Exactly.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,800
It's one of those common foods that you're at home and you want to order something to

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,480
eat and the typical thing is pizza.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Yeah.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,760
And you know, there's some very special language that you've got to use.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,640
You got to know this language when you want to order a pizza.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
Exactly.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,480
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time as a man is ordering pizza.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,200
Good evening.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,520
Pizza house.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,640
This is Marty speaking.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
May I take your order?

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Yes.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,680
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives and extra cheese.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,760
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
Would you like a large pizza instead?

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Sure.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
That sounds good.

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Great.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,680
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
No.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,960
Make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,080
Oh, and make it thin crust.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Okay.

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Thin crust.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,200
Your total is 2150 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Perfect.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Thank you.

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Bye.

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I need your address.

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay.

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,600
So I guess he's not getting his pizza.

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
No.

42
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
He forgot to give his address.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's a bit of a problem.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,800
Let's take a look at some of the vocabulary in Language Takeaway.

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Language Takeaway.

47
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
All right.

48
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,360
We've got some great pizza words for you today.

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,040
And the first one we have is a medium pizza.

50
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Medium pizza.

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Medium pizza.

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
So that's the size, right?

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Yeah.

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Medium.

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
You can say medium or?

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
12 inch.

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
12 inch.

58
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,160
Usually a medium pizza is 12 inches.

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Yeah.

60
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,000
So you could say, I'd like a 12 inch pizza.

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,440
For those of us who use centimeters, this would be more or less 30 centimeters.

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Okay.

64
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,560
All right.

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,440
Let's take a look at the next size, a large pizza.

66
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Large pizza.

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
A large pizza.

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,400
So it might also be called an 18 inch.

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,980
An 18 inch pizza.

70
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,960
Or isn't it sometimes called a family size?

71
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Maybe.

72
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Family size.

73
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,000
I guess it depends where you're ordering.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
So large and medium pizzas.

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Now let's take a look at some of the ingredients.

78
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Yes.

79
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Okay.

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
We have pepperoni.

81
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Pepperoni.

82
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Pepperoni.

83
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
Pepperoni.

84
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
This is the common ingredient in all pizza.

85
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
It's my favorite.

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,680
A pizza is not a pizza unless it has pepperoni.

87
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Okay.

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
So pepperoni is a sausage, right?

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Yeah.

90
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
It's a little bit spicy.

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
It's a little bit spicy.

92
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,800
And they look like a- Like circles.

93
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Red circles.

94
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Yep.

95
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Okay.

96
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Olives.

97
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Olives.

98
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Olives.

99
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Olives.

100
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,280
Olives are little black or green balls.

101
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Yes.

102
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,700
Little green or black balls.

103
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,680
You can also find them in a martini.

104
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Yeah, exactly.

105
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Yep.

106
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
It's very common for them to have...

107
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,800
It's very common to have an...

108
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,360
It's very common to have an olive in a martini.

109
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Yes.

110
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Okay.

111
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
And he also ordered extra cheese.

112
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Extra cheese.

113
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Extra cheese.

114
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
That means more cheese.

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Extra.

116
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
All right.

117
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Another ingredient.

118
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Ham.

119
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Ham.

120
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Ham.

121
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
The meat of a pig.

122
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah.

123
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Ham.

124
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Yep.

125
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Okay.

126
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
And he also ordered another strange ingredient for a pizza.

127
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Pineapple.

128
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Pineapple.

129
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Pineapple.

130
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Pineapple.

131
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Now, this is a fruit.

132
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I know.

133
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
So weird to put pineapple on a pizza.

134
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,840
Many people like pineapple on their pizza.

135
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a tropical fruit.

136
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yep.

137
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Comes from Hawaii.

138
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Usually.

139
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,680
And it kind of looks like a little palm tree at the top.

140
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Yeah.

141
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,120
Like, yeah, the top of a pineapple looks like a tree.

142
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
So pineapple.

143
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Yep.

144
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
All right.

145
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
Now, the last description of a pizza.

146
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,360
He ordered it with thin crust.

147
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
Thin crust.

148
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Thin crust.

149
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Thin crust.

150
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,800
Now, we know thin is some...

151
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Skinny.

152
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Skinny.

153
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
But crust.

154
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
What is crust?

155
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
It's the bread part of the pizza.

156
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
The outside part.

157
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Yep.

158
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Okay.

159
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
So that's the crust.

160
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
That's my favorite part of the pizza.

161
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,840
Thin crust or thick crust?

162
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Thin crust.

163
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Yeah.

164
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Thin crust.

165
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,040
And I just, I really love that bread part.

166
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
It's so important to a good pizza.

167
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Okay.

168
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,960
Well, you know, they also have the crust filled with cheese.

169
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I know.

170
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
It's so wrong.

171
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
That's good, too.

172
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
No.

173
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,080
All right.

174
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,840
Let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

175
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
Good evening.

176
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Pizza house.

177
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,120
This is Marty speaking.

178
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
May I take your order?

179
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Um, yes.

180
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,320
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

181
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,080
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

182
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
Would you like a large pizza instead?

183
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Sure.

184
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
That sounds good.

185
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Great.

186
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?

187
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
No.

188
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,440
I'd like the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

189
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,400
Oh, and make it thin crust.

190
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Okay.

191
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Thin crust.

192
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,320
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

193
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Perfect.

194
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Thank you.

195
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Bye.

196
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Sir, wait.

197
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,360
I need your address.

198
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Okay.

199
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,600
Now we have some really polite language that you could use possibly with customers or with

200
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
clients.

201
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Yep.

202
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Okay.

203
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,680
Let's go to Fluency Builder.

204
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Fluency Builder.

205
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Okay.

206
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
My, all right.

207
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,480
The first phrase we have, um, I think is my favorite.

208
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,920
This is the way that Marty answered the phone, right?

209
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,760
He said, this is Marty speaking.

210
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,200
This is Marty speaking.

211
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,380
This is Marty speaking.

212
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,840
Now why is this so important?

213
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,680
Because a lot of people, when they answer the phone say, I'm Erica.

214
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Like hello, I'm Erica, which is not what English people say.

215
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,920
We always say Erica speaking.

216
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
This is Erica speaking.

217
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Exactly.

218
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
So guys, remember this.

219
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,980
You'll sound really, really great when you use this on the phone.

220
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,560
This is Marty speaking.

221
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Exactly.

222
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
This is Marty.

223
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Well, don't use Marty.

224
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Use your name.

225
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
All right.

226
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
Then you also mentioned a two for one special.

227
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,000
Two for one special.

228
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
A two for one special.

229
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,560
So that means you're getting two pizzas, right?

230
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
For the price of one.

231
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,520
And a special is just a special promotion.

232
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
A special price.

233
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Special price.

234
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes.

235
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Two for one special.

236
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
All right.

237
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
All right.

238
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Now a very easy phrase.

239
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Would you like?

240
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,000
Would you like?

241
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Would you like?

242
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Would you like?

243
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,680
Now this is a great way to offer something.

244
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,040
It's a more polite way of asking, do you want?

245
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Do you want?

246
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,520
Do you want is okay.

247
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah, it's fine.

248
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
But it's less polite than would you like?

249
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Exactly.

250
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,920
Whenever you offer something, would you like a cup of coffee?

251
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Would you like to sit down?

252
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Okay.

253
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,760
So would you like?

254
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,520
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about

255
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,240
pizza from a pizza expert.

256
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Good evening.

257
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,400
Pizza house.

258
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
This is Marty speaking.

259
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
May I take your order?

260
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Yes.

261
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
I'd like a medium pizza.

262
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,760
Would you like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives and extra cheese?

263
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,840
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

264
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Would you like a large pizza instead?

265
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Sure.

266
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
That sounds good.

267
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Great.

268
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,720
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

269
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
No.

270
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,080
Make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers.

271
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Oh, and make it thin crust.

272
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Okay.

273
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Thin crust.

274
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
Your total is 2150 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

275
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Perfect.

276
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Thank you.

277
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Bye.

278
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Thank you.

279
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Thank you for addressing.

280
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,420
All right, we're back and we are here with our pizza expert, who else but Marco from

281
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
ItalianPod.

282
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Hi, everyone.

283
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,040
Marco Two, right?

284
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
Marco One.

285
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
I am Marco Zero.

286
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,840
He is Marco One.

287
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
We've come to an agreement.

288
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
So zero.

289
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,000
What's the deal about this?

290
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,280
Well, we're talking about pizza today and we wanted to know what's your opinion since

291
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,600
pizza comes from Italy, right?

292
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Well, thanks for the question.

293
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,320
First, the Marco Zero.

294
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Is my mic working?

295
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes.

296
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
It should be.

297
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay.

298
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,320
So, the problem with pizza is that, yes, it comes from Italy.

299
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Originated, the story goes, you know, the princess, the queen Margarita.

300
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,400
But the problem is that now this confusion worldwide, pizza and pizza hat, American pizza,

301
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,960
Italian pizza, that is not the same thing.

302
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
It's not the same.

303
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
It's not the same.

304
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay.

305
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
So, pizza hat is an Italian pizza.

306
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
No.

307
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,960
So, okay, here it goes.

308
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:27,240
Italians, a little bit of, Italians make food, but they're not good at branding it.

309
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Okay.

310
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
Americans, they're very good at branding the food.

311
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,080
So they have Starbucks and pizza hat and blah, blah, blah.

312
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,700
The problem is that since they have to brand it, they don't change the name.

313
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,640
So they do this pizza hat that is totally different from Italian pizza.

314
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
How is it different?

315
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,160
Have you ever seen the two of them?

316
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,480
Have you ever compared them?

317
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
Yeah, yeah, they are very different.

318
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
That's true.

319
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,040
So, okay, can you put pineapple and ham on a pizza?

320
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,440
Technically you could.

321
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Like it's possible.

322
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,760
As long as you call it Hawaiian, you can put pineapple in everything, I guess.

323
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,280
But the problem, what I'm trying to say is that, okay, Italian pizza is, you know, you

324
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:19,800
have the flour, the pasta, the crust, the tomato sauce, and then the mozzarella cheese,

325
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,880
and that's the basic, and then you can build on top of it with some variations.

326
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,200
American pizza is basically take everything that you have on the table and put it on it.

327
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
That's the main difference.

328
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,780
But I'm not saying I'm against American pizza.

329
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm saying that you just should change the name to another thing.

330
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,000
What do you suggest we should call it?

331
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Zipa.

332
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Zipa.

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's close enough.

334
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Close enough, yeah.

335
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But maybe you need like an A, like a Zipa.

336
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
A Zipa.

337
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
To indicate that it's American.

338
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A for America.

339
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Maybe.

340
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A dot Zipa.

341
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,360
A dot Zipa dot com.

342
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Can I have A Zipa?

343
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,520
So Margo, I know that you are very much against

344
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,800
having Pizza Hut pizza.

345
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,040
I like it as an exotic experience because I like the fact that it's so much stuff in

346
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,280
it that you cannot even tell the difference between the ingredients.

347
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,800
You know, they have the super mega supreme.

348
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Super supreme.

349
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Super supreme.

350
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
With cheese in the crust.

351
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
I don't even know what's inside.

352
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
It's great.

353
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
It's great.

354
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
It's like there's a part in my mouth and everybody's invited.

355
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,320
That's for me the feeling of American pizza.

356
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,640
Another interesting thing when we were eating pizza with Marco is that he noticed the way

357
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
that people from different countries eat pizza.

358
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
That's right.

359
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,920
Italian people fold their pizza.

360
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
We do fold.

361
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
And another thing is that we have a whole pizza.

362
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,800
Like if I order one pizza, it's not like I share, everybody has one slice of it.

363
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,360
We order one pizza, you order your pizza, she order her pizza and so on.

364
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Pizza is personal.

365
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,680
Pizza is a person.

366
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,720
Don't mess with my pizza, Marco Zero.

367
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,400
All right, well, this whole pizza discussion, let's see what our listeners have to say about

368
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
it.

369
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,200
I know that we have listeners from all over the world and what do they do with their pizzas?

370
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes.

371
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Or their zippas.

372
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Or their zippas.

373
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
What do you like on your pizza?

374
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Exactly.

375
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,560
For example, how high do you want the crust to be?

376
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Thin.

377
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
How high?

378
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Thin.

379
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
How thin you want your crust to be?

380
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,760
I know that, for example, in some countries they put ketchup on their pizza.

381
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,200
I know once I was eating, I had a Japanese friend who ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut

382
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,260
and the pizza had the pineapple and other stuff on it and then she took out like ketchup

383
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,960
and mayonnaise and she got like wild.

384
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,520
Although I must tell you, I like Tabasco on my pizza and I know that's wrong.

385
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I know.

386
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I'm sorry.

387
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
But I like it.

388
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,200
You do what you have to do, Erika.

389
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,080
And history will judge you for that.

390
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Alright we better go.

391
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,160
We're out of time and before Marco has a heart attack or an aneurysm or something, we're

392
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
making him angry here.

393
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,720
And if you have any questions for us and also for Marco because I'm sure he's going to be

394
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,520
commenting on this aspect.

395
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Sure.

396
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,720
