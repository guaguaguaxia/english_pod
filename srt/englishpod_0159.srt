00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,520
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
Welcome back everyone.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,600
So, what are we talking about today, Marco?

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,600
We are going to the flower shop.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,520
Okay, so this is an intermediate level lesson and we're going to be learning about the different

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,120
kinds of flowers you can buy at a flower shop.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,720
And so, we've got a guy here who's probably trying to say something to someone he loves.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,040
Yeah, I think he did something to his girlfriend or wife.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,440
And well, that's the typical thing, right?

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,040
You do something wrong, so you got to get her flowers.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,920
And that's why women are often very nervous when their husband or boyfriend gives them

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,480
flowers because she's thinking, hmm, what did he do wrong?

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,720
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue and we'll be back soon.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,320
Hello, sir.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
How may I help you?

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,680
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Something really nice.

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
I see.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
May I ask what the occasion is?

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,880
It's not really an occasion.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,720
It's more like I'm sorry.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Very well.

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,240
This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,800
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
stands out.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,440
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,340
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,340
What else do you recommend?

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,600
Hmm, well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,120
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,320
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,240
I don't think that's going to cut it.

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,760
I need something bigger and better.

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,840
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly did you do?

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,400
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,680
Get out of my store, you jerk.

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
All right, we're back.

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
So what do you think?

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Is this really like a bad thing to do?

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Heck yeah.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
No, really?

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Well, no one wants to hear that someone thinks they're fat.

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,160
Okay, and chubby is maybe not as bad as fat, but the guy could have been a little bit nicer.

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,240
All right, so we'll give our listeners some advice towards the end of the lesson.

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,060
So now why don't we take a look at all the flower names in Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
Language Takeaway

49
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,860
Okay, this first flower is a beautiful one and it has delicious seeds that people like

50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,920
to eat.

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
It's called a sunflower.

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
A sunflower.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,800
All right, so that's a yellow flower, right?

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,960
It's bright yellow and in the middle is orange and the stems are very, very long.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
And thick.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah, and thick.

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
So it's a tall flower.

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Okay, sunflower.

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,200
And yeah, as you mentioned, some people eat sunflower seeds.

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
They're like the little salty ones, right?

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
That's right.

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
They're really good.

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
All right, next is an orchid.

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,880
Okay, an orchid is a beautiful flower and they're often grown just one at a time and

65
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,160
people collect orchids.

66
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
So these can be very, very expensive.

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
They're very expensive.

68
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,560
And they come in all shapes, sizes and colors.

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,940
Okay, an orchid.

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,480
Now what about a tulip?

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,720
A tulip is another pretty flower and I think they're most famous in Holland for their tulips

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,600
because this actually used to be the kind of money that they would use.

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
This was their currency for many years.

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
So they used to use tulips.

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,440
They used to use tulips and the tulip flower is kind of like a, it's like a champagne glass.

76
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,440
It's tall and it's kind of empty in the middle.

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Oh, that's interesting.

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,560
So next time somebody says, do you think money grows on trees?

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,080
In Holland it literally did.

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Well, yeah.

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Almost.

82
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Almost.

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
All right, what about a carnation?

84
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,280
Okay, a carnation is another pretty flower and they come, I think, in red, pink and white.

85
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,840
Yeah, I've mostly seen white carnations.

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
Yeah.

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,800
And, you know, flower giving, there's a whole definition to it, right?

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
So yeah, every flower is symbolic of something.

89
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,040
Red roses are for love and carnations, I think, are generally for either friendship or like

90
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,200
when someone died, I'm not sure.

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
You can give them to somebody who's passed away.

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Really?

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm not sure.

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I'll have to look it up.

95
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,560
But carnation is another very, very common flower that you'll see in many different colors.

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Okay.

97
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,040
And a flower is also really common.

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
It's a lily.

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
All right.

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,960
A lily is a beautiful flower and usually you see these on water.

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,200
So water lilies, for example, is another name you might hear.

102
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Okay.

103
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,800
A water lily or just a regular lily.

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,560
And next we have the most common of all the flowers, but we've added a little twist to

105
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
it.

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
It's a long stem rose.

107
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Right.

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
So rose, everyone knows.

109
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,280
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

110
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,760
Shakespeare wrote a lot about roses.

111
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,280
But in this case, we're talking about long stem roses.

112
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,440
And we talked about this with sunflowers.

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,520
The stem is the green part that grows out of the ground and you think of the flower

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,680
as the head.

115
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,640
And so the stem is actually the connector between the ground and the flower.

116
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Okay.

117
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,360
So these types of roses have a really long stem.

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
So they're very nice to like maybe give one of them away.

119
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
That's right.

120
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,240
And you see, for example, at the opera, you see singers, people throw these roses at them

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,720
and they pick them up and they're so long, the stems are so long and they collect them

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,960
in their arms.

123
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
And so that's a long stem rose.

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
All right.

125
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Interesting.

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Okay.

127
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,280
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time?

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,040
Let's keep a lookout for these flower names and their pronunciation.

129
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,000
And we'll come back in a little bit.

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Hello, sir.

131
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
How may I help you?

132
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,320
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

133
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Something really nice.

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
I see.

135
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,080
May I ask what the occasion is?

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
It's not really an occasion.

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,360
It's more like I'm sorry.

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Very well.

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,920
This flower arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

140
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,440
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
stands out.

142
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,080
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
What else do you recommend?

145
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,200
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

146
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

147
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,960
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

148
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
I don't think that's going to cut it.

149
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,400
I need something bigger and better.

150
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm sorry, sir.

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,440
But what exactly did you do?

152
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,240
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
Get out of my store, you jerk.

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
All right, we're back.

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,480
So in this dialogue, we had a lot of interesting phrases.

156
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,080
So let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

157
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,160
Fluency Builder.

158
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,760
A lot of these phrases, Marco, have to do with, well, what the guy did wrong in today's

159
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
dialogue.

160
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,200
And so the first one is to cheat on.

161
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,480
So the woman offered him the I'm sorry I cheated on you package, right?

162
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,160
So it's like an arrangement of flowers that usually people buy when they cheated on their

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
boyfriend or girlfriend.

164
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Right.

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,720
And so in this case, to cheat on means to see another person.

166
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:03,740
So if you're married to a woman, seeing someone else, you know, having a date or romantic

167
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,920
encounter with another person is cheating on your wife.

168
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,360
So you're cheating on your wife.

169
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Right.

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
You use it like this.

171
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Cheat on, right?

172
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Cheat on.

173
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,680
So he cheated on her or they were both cheating on each other.

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,640
OK, so to cheat on.

175
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,720
Not a good thing.

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Not a good thing.

177
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
All right.

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,000
So he was explaining to her that wasn't enough.

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
The arrangement wasn't enough.

180
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,880
And he said, I don't think that's going to cut it.

181
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,480
Well, OK, you've probably heard the word cut before.

182
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,760
But in this case, Marco, we're talking about to be able to cut something, cut it.

183
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,200
So that's not going to cut it or it's not going to cut it.

184
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,440
It's not going to be enough.

185
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Exactly.

186
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
So that's not quite what I'm looking for.

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
It's not enough.

188
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
He wants bigger and better.

189
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
He wants more.

190
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,020
And so, for example, we could say, you know what?

191
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,480
This dessert's not going to cut it.

192
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,120
We need something much fancier.

193
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,800
OK, so to be good enough for.

194
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
OK, so to be good enough for.

195
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
All right.

196
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Very good.

197
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,480
And then he was explaining to the shop lady what happened.

198
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,600
And he said, well, I accidentally insinuated.

199
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,560
OK, to insinuate is to suggest.

200
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,520
So I could say, hey, you're really chubby.

201
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
That's not an insinuation.

202
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
That's a statement.

203
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,280
But I could say, well, you're looking a little bit round at the sides.

204
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,840
That's an insinuation because I'm suggesting without saying something.

205
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Right.

206
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
So you're saying something indirectly.

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Exactly.

208
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,960
And he was insinuating that his girlfriend was getting chubbier.

209
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Chubby.

210
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,720
So chubby, chubbier, chubbiest.

211
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,080
In this case, we're talking about being round or a little bit overweight.

212
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Right.

213
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
So it's not really saying fat.

214
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
No, fat is rude.

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Chubby is, you know, it's in between.

216
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Just a little bit extra pounds.

217
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah, like maybe you had a little bit too much ice cream over the past couple months.

218
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
All right.

219
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Very good.

220
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:54,400
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

221
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Hello, sir.

222
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
How may I help you?

223
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,660
I would like to buy some flowers, please.

224
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Something really nice.

225
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
I see.

226
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,440
May I ask what the occasion is?

227
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,860
It's not really an occasion.

228
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,680
It's more like I'm sorry.

229
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Very well.

230
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,680
This flower arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends.

231
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,780
It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that

232
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
stands out.

233
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,440
It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

234
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,320
I think I'm going to need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear.

235
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,880
What else do you recommend?

236
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,560
Well, this is our I'm sorry I cheated on you package.

237
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,100
Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies.

238
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,300
The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

239
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,200
I don't think that's going to cut it.

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,720
I need something bigger and better.

241
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly did you do?

242
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,360
Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,640
Get out of my store, you jerk.

244
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,480
All right, so if you make a mistake, like as a guy, right, you give flowers to your

245
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
girlfriend.

246
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
What about women giving flowers to guys?

247
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Is that common?

248
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,880
Do you think that's possible?

249
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Can you do that?

250
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm sure you can do it, but I don't know if it's as common.

251
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,960
Like I think as a guy, I wouldn't really feel comfortable receiving flowers.

252
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,640
I mean, I would be touched by the gesture and I would be like, oh, that's really sweet.

253
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,760
But like flowers, it's a little bit too feminine, I think.

254
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,680
Generally, I think it's a one sided thing.

255
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,120
So you can get flowers for your mother or you can get flowers for a friend or if someone,

256
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,880
you know, passed away, you can get flowers for their family.

257
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,480
But in a romantic situation, rarely do you get flowers to a guy.

258
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,520
So if you want to say I'm sorry to a guy, what do you give him?

259
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,000
Season tickets to his favorite football team.

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That works.

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Or a game for his PlayStation.

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,840
A game for his PlayStation or offer him a new coat of paint on his car.

263
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,960
I don't know.

264
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,920
Have you never given a gift to somebody like saying I'm sorry?

265
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
No.

266
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
No, you don't make mistakes.

267
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,960
I like to use my words.

268
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
That's good.

269
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Yeah, this is kind of interesting.

270
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Why do we do this?

271
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,320
So why do we give gifts to people as a token or as a demonstration of our regretfulness?

272
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
Well, can I get personal for a second?

273
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,680
I just was thinking about this in terms of engagement.

274
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,960
So why do people give a ring when they get engaged?

275
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,040
So I think it's because people like things that glitter, you know, it's like distract

276
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,000
the woman and she'll say yes.

277
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,840
And so it's the similar thing with with flowers and forgiveness.

278
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,680
You say, oh, gosh, these flowers are so beautiful.

279
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Of course, I forgive you.

280
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Oh, they're so pretty.

281
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,040
They smell so, you know, it's like it's like distraction from the matter at hand.

282
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Right.

283
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Maybe that's it.

284
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
I know.

285
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
If you disagree with me, please.

286
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,800
It was a very wise man who invented this.

287
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Absolutely.

288
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
All right.

289
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,360
So if you have any questions, doubts or comments, please come to our website, EnglishPod.com

290
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
and we'll see you guys there.

291
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Bye, everyone.

292
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,880
Bye.
