1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,480
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,960
And today, Marco, you and I are talking about movies, right?

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,040
We're talking a little bit about movies, but mostly we're having a big argument.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,560
Okay, I kind of like arguments.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,700
Lots of great words and phrases for you to learn here in English.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,800
But we've got an upper intermediate level lesson with some people who are not getting

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
along very well.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,520
It's a couple, a guy and a girl, and they're having a fight, as couples do.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,580
So we're going to be learning a lot of the different language that they are using in

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,840
this very heated debate.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,040
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time, and then we'll be right back.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,920
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,480
Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,160
Well, you should have picked.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,840
In the end, you always complain about everything.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
Not everything.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,240
Just this film.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,200
Even the title was ridiculous.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
And it's so long.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,680
Those were the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,620
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,080
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,480
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
in the garbage.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,360
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,480
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,520
Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,360
At least he appreciates love stories.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,440
Love stories?

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,520
More like one night stands.

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,880
Don't criticize Mario, or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,920
They're no saints.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
My friends?

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Fat?

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,160
What about those whales you call friends?

40
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,320
You're unbearable.

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
You can walk home.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
I'm leaving.

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:07,720
I think the guy was exaggerating a little bit.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
What do you think?

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
I think they were both exaggerating.

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,320
You know, by the end of an argument, both people are saying things that maybe they don't

47
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
mean.

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,920
I think we'll talk a little bit more about this towards the end of the show, but now,

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,160
why don't we take a look at language takeaway.

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,320
Language takeaway.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Alright on language takeaway today, we have four words and the first one that you probably

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,960
saw in the very first sentence is a chick flick.

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Chick flick.

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,560
So, first of all, the word chick means a woman.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,520
It's slang and it's not very nice.

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
It's not very nice.

57
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
No.

58
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,240
Well, I mean, between guys, you would use it as like, oh, this chick or that chick,

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,880
but you wouldn't really walk up to a girl and call her a chick, right?

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,200
No, you wouldn't say, hey, chick, what's up?

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,360
Not something you want to say.

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,280
So chick is a slang word for a girl or a woman and a chick flick is a girl's movie.

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,080
So a flick is a movie.

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Another slang word.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Exactly.

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
So this is the slang phrase for flick.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,120
So hey, Marco, what flicks are showing at the movie theater?

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
All right.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah.

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
So movies.

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,200
So in the chick flick is usually a romantic movie, a drama, something that's very, um.

72
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Like beaches.

73
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,080
Beaches is a chick flick.

74
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,400
I don't know if you've ever seen that.

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I've never seen it.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,880
So he's just not that into you is one of those new chick flicks.

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,280
Or like how to lose a guy in 10 days.

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Yeah.

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,120
How to lose a guy in 10 days or the devil wears Prada.

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Bride Wars.

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Bride Wars.

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Wow.

83
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Lots of chick flicks.

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,320
I've actually never seen any one of these except how to lose a guy in 10 days.

85
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,880
I've actually only seen that one.

86
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
All right.

87
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,480
So chick flick is a girl's or woman's movie.

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,240
And next up we have a word, sarcastic.

89
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
We're talking about sarcastic jokes.

90
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,960
So sarcastic jokes or somebody being sarcastic.

91
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,240
God, Marco, you're always so sarcastic.

92
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,760
So what would sarcasm sound like?

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Um, yeah, he's really funny.

94
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,440
All right.

95
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,380
So it's not really what you're saying.

96
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,320
It's kind of how you're saying it.

97
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Right.

98
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,480
So it's kind of like by saying, he's really funny.

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
You're saying, yeah, he's a funny guy.

100
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,520
But if I say, oh, he's really funny.

101
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,040
I'm saying he's not funny.

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840
He's being mean or he's a jerk.

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
Sarcasm is kind of one of those things that it's a little bit difficult to learn how to

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,760
do or to actually get it right.

105
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Especially in English.

106
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Right?

107
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Yeah.

108
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Marco, great explanation.

109
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Exactly.

110
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
That's the way it goes.

111
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Oh, yeah.

112
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
You're so funny.

113
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
So you're amazing.

114
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
You should go to you.

115
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
You went to sarcasm school.

116
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
So my parents like to say.

117
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
You can be really mean, Catherine.

118
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Sorry.

119
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Just kidding.

120
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
All right.

121
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,600
So apart from being sarcastic, you can criticize someone.

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Like you're ever critical.

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
All right.

124
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Sorry, I'll stop.

125
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
You're really into character right now.

126
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
All right.

127
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,680
So critical to criticize someone is to complain about them or to say that the things that

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
they do are not very good.

129
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,080
So you can criticize a person or a movie.

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah.

131
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,520
So this movie wasn't very good.

132
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
It wasn't funny.

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
The actors were bad.

134
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,280
It was really long.

135
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
These are criticisms.

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Criticisms.

137
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
All right.

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,080
Well, and then moving on, the girl was finally tired of the guy and his complaints.

139
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,120
And she said he's unbearable.

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
Gosh, you're unbearable.

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,800
So the root of this word is to be able to like to stand something, to bear it.

142
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,680
And so if you're unbearable, something is unbearable, you just can't stand it.

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
All right.

144
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
So you're tired of it.

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
You can't stand it.

146
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,240
She thinks he's so unbearable, she makes him get out of the car.

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
And she leaves.

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Yeah.

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
She said you can walk home.

150
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
All right.

151
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,480
So that's an unbearable person, right?

152
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Okay.

153
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,440
So we took a look at those four main words here in our dialogue.

154
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's move on now to some of the phrases that we found in Fluency Builder.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,760
Fluency Builder.

156
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,080
This first one's a common one, especially when we talk about women and men and the relationship

157
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
between women and men.

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,280
We say about men that maybe they should be more in touch with their feelings or their

159
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
feminine side.

160
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Yeah.

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, so if you're saying to be more in touch with your feminine side, what exactly are

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you saying?

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a good question.

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,040
Well, what you're saying is that you want to be able to express your feelings more or

165
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,280
you want to be able to understand more about your feminine side or something like this.

166
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,460
So to be in touch with is more about yourself.

167
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,120
It's about self-reflection and self-understanding.

168
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,280
So you could say, I'm a very serious person, but I want to make some changes in my life.

169
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,320
So I'm trying to be more in touch with my inner child.

170
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Your inner child.

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
All right.

172
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,480
So to be in touch with, and it's usually related to feelings, to something intangible.

173
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Or to behavior.

174
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
To behavior.

175
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,920
All right.

176
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,840
Moving on now, a heated phrase, a one night stand.

177
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,480
Oh, I'll let you explain this one, Marco.

178
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
All right.

179
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,040
So a one night stand is a casual and very quick temporal encounter that's usually a

180
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,360
sexual encounter.

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
It's romantic, right?

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,680
So it can be between two different people.

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,960
They meet each other one night.

184
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,280
They have a relationship for one night only, and then they never see each other again.

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
So it's casual.

186
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
It's casual.

187
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,760
Very good.

188
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,000
So yeah, you would see this.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
You see this a lot in shows like, you know, Sex in the City and all that stuff.

190
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
Yeah, they have a lot of one night stands in that show.

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
All right.

192
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,960
So a one night stand.

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,240
And well, related to this, the girl was criticizing his friends, and she said, they're no saints.

194
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay.

195
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
So we can say this in many different ways.

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,000
He's no saint.

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She's no saint.

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Or I'm no saint.

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're no saint.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,320
So a saint is a good person.

201
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a word that we use in religion to say someone who's like Mother Teresa, or someone

202
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,960
who's just really good and kind.

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,200
Doesn't commit any sins.

204
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Exactly.

205
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,760
And so to say, I'm no saint is to say, well, I do bad things, or I say bad things.

206
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm not perfect.

207
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Okay.

208
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,800
So he or they, they're no saints.

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
They do bad stuff too.

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, very good.

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,880
So that's the way that you would use, he's no saint, they're no saints.

212
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
All right.

213
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,800
So I think now we should listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be right back.

214
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:24,760
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

215
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,320
Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

216
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, you should have picked.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,720
In the end, you always complain about everything.

218
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,120
Not everything, just this film.

219
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,080
Even the title was ridiculous.

220
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
And it's so long.

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,520
Those were the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

222
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,480
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

223
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

224
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,360
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

225
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in the garbage.

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

228
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,320
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

229
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,400
Next time, go with your gay friend who's more in touch with his feelings.

230
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,720
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

231
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
At least he appreciates love stories.

232
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,280
Love stories?

233
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,360
More like one night stands.

234
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,760
Don't criticize Mario, or else I'll start on those fat drunk friends of yours.

235
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
They're no saints.

236
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
My friends?

237
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Fat?

238
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,040
What about those whales you call friends?

239
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
You're unbearable.

240
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
You can walk home.

241
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm leaving.

242
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Bye.

243
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Good luck.

244
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Bye.

245
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:45,720
All right, so, Catherine, is this an argument that you would say is typical among couples?

246
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,420
Or maybe people that are probably about to break up?

247
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,440
Not couples that are happy, I would say.

248
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
But yeah, you definitely have people who are...

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,840
Well, I guess it's kind of the battle of the sexes, right?

250
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,420
You have people who are different genders and so they don't always understand each other.

251
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,560
You know, you want to have your girlfriends as a girl and your girlfriends behave and

252
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,660
talk in a certain way together and guys do the same thing but with their friends.

253
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,080
And so sometimes you have these clashes, these interactions that are negative and you know

254
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,120
when people are upset with each other, they say mean things.

255
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,560
And especially I think in this case, they don't really like each other's friends.

256
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Exactly.

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,440
And that's a kind of a common thing.

258
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,600
Like a guy doesn't like his girlfriend's friends because maybe they gossip too much or something

259
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
like that.

260
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
And the same thing with the girls, right?

261
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,720
Because a guy's friends maybe drink too much.

262
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,760
Drink too much, play too many card games.

263
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
They're single.

264
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,360
So I think a lot of times these problems also have to do with the fact that like when a

265
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,000
girl is with her girlfriend, she maybe acts differently.

266
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,840
Or when a guy is with his guy friends.

267
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,040
And so that's weird sometimes for the relationship because you see your partner acting differently

268
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
with other people.

269
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Right.

270
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
So, do you like your boyfriend or girlfriend's friends?

271
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Do you get in fights about this kind of stuff?

272
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Or you know what?

273
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
The in-laws.

274
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,680
Oh, that's a whole another situation.

275
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
That's a whole another situation.

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Absolutely.
