00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,720
And my name is Katrin and today we have an elementary level lesson for you guys out there.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
That's right.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,080
Today we are going to talk about an interesting topic, especially for women.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,080
We are going to the nail salon.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,920
Okay, so we're going to get our fingernails painted.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,960
Alright, so let's take a look at vocabulary preview to find out what nail salon means.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,160
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,080
Alright so if you go to a nail salon, it's a specific place where they paint your nails,

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
right?

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Exactly.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,320
So it's a shop or a store where you can have your nails painted.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,380
So they have special people to help you.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,320
If you want to go get your hair cut, you would go to the hair salon.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Exactly.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,040
So we have hair salon and nail salon.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,040
In this case, at the nail salon, they can't cut your hair.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,320
Okay, very good.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,960
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,880
Honey, I'll be right back.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Where are you going?

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,240
I told you already.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm going to get my nails done.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Again?

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,600
You just went last week.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,080
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,960
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,320
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
You should come with me.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Why?

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,560
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,160
They don't only paint my nails.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,240
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
nail polish.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,680
Yeah, sounds like something I should definitely do.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,880
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,720
So now we found some very interesting and specific words related to nails.

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,280
So why don't we look at those now on Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
All right, so this first word is an important word for every woman to know and I know a

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,080
lot of men who get this too.

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
It's called a manicure.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,880
All right, manicure.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,360
And what exactly is a manicure?

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,320
Well, a manicure is a service that you get at a nail salon.

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,800
And that means that the people at the nail salon will cut your nails and shape your nails.

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,840
That means if you want them to be pointy or boxy and then you get them painted and dried.

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,960
Okay, so they basically take care of your nails, of your fingernails, a manicure.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Exactly.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,160
And so the important thing to remember here that a manicure is for your hands.

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,520
Right, so you can also get your toenails or your feet taken care of, right?

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Exactly.

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
So that's different.

55
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,160
That's a pedicure because peda means foot.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,480
So pedicure is for your feet and a manicure is for your hands.

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,760
All right, very good.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,360
And well, we talked about painting your nails and that paint has a specific name, right?

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Exactly.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,760
So you wouldn't use wall paint on your fingers, would you?

61
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,680
So you have to use a special paint and this is called nail polish.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
Nail polish, okay.

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,080
So a polish is something that makes a surface or a thing shiny.

64
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,280
Okay, so nail polish is a paint that makes your nails very shiny.

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
All right, very good.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,960
And well, moving on, we talked about a manicure and there's a specific word for the person

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,760
that provides this service that takes care of your nails.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,960
Okay, so the job at a nail salon is manicurist.

69
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,720
That's the person who paints your nails, okay?

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,800
And so you could say, I have a favorite manicurist.

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,280
Her name is Sally.

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,400
Okay, very good.

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,200
And well, a manicurist, they perform a manicure and well, apart from painting your nails,

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,200
they also push your cuticles or remove your cuticles like in the dialogue.

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
What are the cuticles?

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,880
Okay, cuticle is a very hard word.

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,680
This word describes the skin around your fingernail, okay?

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,840
So you have skin all over your body, but on your fingernail, you have special kind of

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
skin.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,640
And so a manicurist will sometimes push or cut the dead skin, that's the cuticle, from

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
your finger.

82
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Okay, very good.

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,320
And if you look at your fingernails now, you will see a little thin layer of skin on your

84
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,560
fingernail.

85
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
That's the cuticle.

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,480
And well, apart from removing your cuticles and painting your nails, they will also file

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
your nails.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,080
And this is a verb, to file.

89
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,360
To file, okay.

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,680
So this is a word that's kind of like cut or trim, but a file is a more delicate process.

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,040
So it means that we kind of shave off very, very, very little at a time.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,720
And so to file your nails means to make them shaped differently or to smooth them.

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,480
They're not cutting, clip, clip, clip.

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
It's not that.

95
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,720
It's a little bit less than that.

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,800
And now there's also a noun for this, a nail file.

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
And most women will usually have it.

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,840
It's a long piece of cardboard that has a paper that's kind of like sand on it, kind

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,880
of like sandpaper.

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,640
It doesn't feel good when you rub it with your hand.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,240
But if you use it on your nails, it will little by little just take away little parts of your

102
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
nail.

103
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Yeah.

104
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Like that.

105
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,440
You usually see it, the many secretaries, you know, in TV shows, they're always filing

106
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
their nails.

107
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Exactly.

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Making them perfect.

109
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Okay.

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,040
So those are the words we have for language takeaway.

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit.

112
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
Honey, I'll be right back.

113
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Where are you going?

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,760
I told you already.

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm going to get my nails done.

116
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Again?

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
You just went last week.

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,000
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

120
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,040
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
You should come with me.

122
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Why?

123
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,520
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

124
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
They don't only paint my nails.

125
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,200
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of

126
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
nail polish.

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Yeah.

128
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,400
It sounds like something I should definitely do.

129
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,120
All right, we're back.

130
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,000
So now why don't we start with some phrases, some very good phrases that we found in this

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,720
dialogue in Fluency Builder.

132
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Fluency Builder.

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,400
This first phrase is really important when we talk about nails because it's the way that

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
we describe going to the nail salon.

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,720
So I can say, I'm going to get my nails done today.

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Okay, so to get your nails done.

137
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,840
That means that you're going to get your nails cut, filed, painted, etc.

138
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm going to get a manicure, but that's very, I don't know, serious.

139
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,040
So you could say, I'm going to get my nails done.

140
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,320
It's more spoken language.

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,080
Okay, so I'm going to get my nails done or you got your nails done.

142
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Very good.

143
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,080
And well, the woman was talking about why she likes to go get a manicure and she said

144
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,400
that she likes to pamper herself.

145
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,120
Okay, this is very common, especially when women are trying to talk about why they spend

146
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
money on hair and nails and clothes.

147
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
They say, I like to pamper myself.

148
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,400
To pamper means to treat very, very well.

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay.

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,320
So if you go get a manicure, it's kind of like pampering yourself or maybe going to

151
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
a spa.

152
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,400
Exactly, or getting a massage.

153
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,320
And so we could say also, don't pamper the dog.

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,560
He's very naughty.

155
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,920
So a synonym would be to spoil.

156
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,800
To spoil oneself, to pamper.

157
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Indulge.

158
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Okay.

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,200
So, and well, she was talking about how they perform a manicure and she talked about four

160
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,280
coats of nail polish.

161
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,440
So a coat, we know that it's kind of like a jacket, right?

162
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,320
But in this case, it means a layer.

163
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,520
So you paint your nails one time.

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Okay.

165
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,720
You have color.

166
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Maybe it doesn't look right.

167
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay.

168
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
It's very thin.

169
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,280
So you say, okay, I'm going to paint two coats and then you paint one more time and the color

170
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
gets darker and you paint one more time and the color gets very dark and very thick.

171
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,800
And so these are called coats.

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
That means layers of nail polish.

173
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
And that's a special word we use when we're talking about painting our nails.

174
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Right.

175
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,760
So not only for nails, but if you're painting your house, maybe you need two or three coats

176
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
of paint.

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Exactly.

178
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,880
If we have a red wall and we want to paint it white, we definitely need two, three, maybe

179
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
four coats of paint.

180
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
Otherwise, we'll still see the red.

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Okay.

182
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Very good.

183
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
Very interesting phrases.

184
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,640
Let's take a look at this dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back shortly.

185
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:55,040
Honey, I'll be right back.

186
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Where are you going?

187
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,520
I told you already.

188
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,920
I'm going to get my nails done again.

189
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,840
You just went last week.

190
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,440
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

192
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

193
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
You should come with me.

194
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Why?

195
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,800
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

196
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
They don't only paint my nails.

197
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,480
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of

198
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
nail polish.

199
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah, sounds like something I should definitely do.

200
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
All right, we're back.

201
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,080
So, Catherine, are you a big fan of manicures?

202
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,400
Do you get it done often?

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
I didn't used to, but I really enjoy them now.

204
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,200
I think it's a nice way to relax on the weekends.

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,680
So every couple of weeks, I go to the nail salon and I get my nails done.

206
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
All right.

207
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,040
I think one of the words that we didn't talk about here, but it's very, I don't know, for

208
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,640
men it's kind of a strange smell, is nail polish remover.

209
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,760
The acetone, right?

210
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,300
It's a very strong chemical.

211
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,280
It is really disgusting.

212
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,520
Nail polish remover, you know, the word to remove means to take away.

213
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,280
And so when the nail polish, we want to change the color, we have to use this.

214
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,920
It's like water, but it smells really bad.

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,120
And so my boyfriend always gets angry when I use the nail polish remover because the

216
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,760
whole house starts to stink.

217
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,040
It's a very strong smell and you get kind of dizzy.

218
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
So that's why.

219
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Yeah, it goes into your head.

220
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
All right.

221
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,560
