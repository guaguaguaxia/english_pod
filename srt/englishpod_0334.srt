00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,040
My name is Catherine and today we're talking a little bit about small talk.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,040
That's right.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,760
We are getting towards the end of our series.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,360
Actually this is the last podcast that we will have all about small talk and we're just

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,920
going to be following Mr. Campbell and Michelle and Melissa and they're just going to talk

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,000
very briefly about the weather, about traveling, very casual things.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,660
So let's take a listen to this dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,440
going on.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,620
Hi ladies.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,200
Thanks for picking me up.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,320
It's awful weather out there.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
Absolutely.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,040
It's been raining for hours.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
How are you Melissa?

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Are you okay?

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm great thanks Mr. Campbell.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,700
Do you have any business trips plans in Mr. Campbell?

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Of course.

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
I'm always traveling.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm leaving for London next Monday and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,560
It's going to be a busy month.

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,180
How about you Michelle?

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,840
Do you have any vacation plans?

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Yes.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see my ex-parents for the spring festival and hopefully

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,760
next year we will visit London.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,240
I hear it's a wonderful city.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,560
I couldn't agree more.

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,380
London is really fantastic.

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,380
It's my favorite city.

34
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm sure you'll have a great time.

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
All right.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
We're back.

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,720
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,560
All right.

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,400
We don't have that much today in language takeaway but we do have a couple of really

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
important words and phrases.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
The first one comes from the very first line.

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,400
Mr. Campbell says, hi ladies.

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,960
Thanks for picking me up.

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
That's right.

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,880
Now this phrasal verb, to pick someone up, means to get them, right?

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,840
Yeah, to gather them, to collect them.

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,240
You can do this with a car like I will pick you up at the airport.

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,600
But you can also do it in person by just walking to a place and meeting somebody and then taking

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,080
them somewhere else.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
That's the important part.

51
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,160
You take them somewhere else.

52
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,420
So maybe if you go pick your kids up from school, you just walk there, you get them

53
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,840
and you walk back home.

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
That's right.

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,160
And so the key here is that you remember that the verb goes first, I will pick and then

56
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
you have the person.

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,200
I will pick you up.

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
I will pick them up.

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,560
He will pick us up.

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
That's right.

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,200
So the subject goes between pick and up.

62
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
That's right.

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
All right.

64
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
So we're going to pick someone up.

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
And then Mr. Campbell comments on the weather.

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
He says it's awful weather out there.

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
It's awful.

68
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
All right.

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,480
So awful, you listen to the tone, you automatically think that this is probably a bad thing.

70
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
And you're right, it is a bad thing.

71
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,120
But what's another way to say awful?

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
It's terrible.

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
It's bad.

74
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,120
It's horrible.

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,640
So awful is a way to say something's really bad.

76
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,460
And we use it very often with the weather.

77
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
This weather is awful.

78
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,920
But we can also use it about other things like food, for example.

79
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,720
So if you have something to eat and it doesn't taste good, you can say this is awful.

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
What is this?

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
Or what's that awful smell?

82
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Oh, Marco took his shoes off.

83
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Right, an awful smell.

84
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
All right.

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,760
And well, Mr. Campbell went on to tell them that he's taking another trip soon, but a

86
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,240
specific kind of trip.

87
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
All right.

88
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,840
So you know that there are many different kinds of trips, but the one that he's taking

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,160
is a business trip.

90
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,960
So normally we could just say I'm going on a trip next year.

91
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,480
But here we specify, we say it's a business trip.

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,880
So what are we doing on this trip, Marco?

93
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
That's right.

94
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
So we're basically working.

95
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,400
We're going because our company needs us to go to a meeting or to do some work abroad.

96
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
All right.

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
So you know on a business trip that you'll be doing work things, you'll be having meetings,

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,920
you will not be going to Disney World, you will not be meeting with friends and going

99
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,240
to movies probably.

100
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
Right, exactly.

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
So it's very different from a vacation.

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,760
A vacation you go with the objective of going to these fun places.

103
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
So can I say I'm going on a business vacation?

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
No, you're either going on vacation or you're taking a business trip.

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,880
All right, business trip.

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,360
So now let's take a break and let's review our dialogue.

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,400
Hi, ladies.

108
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Thanks for picking me up.

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,480
It's awful weather out there.

110
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,200
Absolutely.

111
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,240
It's been raining for hours.

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
How are you, Melissa?

113
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Are you okay?

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm great, thanks, Mr. Campbell.

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Do you have any business trips plans in, Mr. Campbell?

116
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,560
Of course, I'm always traveling.

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,120
I'll leave for London next Monday and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

118
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,760
It's going to be a busy month.

119
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,400
How about you, Michelle?

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,040
Do you have any vacation plans?

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,240
Yes, Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the spring festival

122
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,000
and hopefully next year we will visit London.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
I hear it's a wonderful city.

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,040
I couldn't agree more.

125
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
London is really fantastic.

126
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
It's my favorite city.

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm sure you'll have a great time.

128
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,920
All right, so now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

129
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Fluency Builder.

130
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,000
All right, now we have a great phrase for everybody here in Fluency Builder.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,040
Melissa is talking to Mr. Campbell and he asks her how she is.

132
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Are you okay?

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,560
And she says, I'm great, thanks.

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,280
Now Marco, why would we use this phrase instead of I'm fine, thank you?

135
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,920
Well, it's basically the same thing.

136
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,260
It's just another way of answering this common question, how are you?

137
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,040
You can say I'm fine, thank you.

138
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,280
I'm well.

139
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,720
But this is just another way of saying I'm okay.

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,240
All right, but I think it's important too to remember that this is also very casual

141
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,840
like the rest of the conversation and pretty enthusiastic.

142
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
She's great.

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,520
So, it's important to remember that I'm fine, thanks is standard, it's very normal, but

144
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm great is a nice way to change it and do something different.

145
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
That's right.

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Okay.

147
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,440
And now we wanted to ask if we have any plans, but we wanted to know if we have any vacation

148
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
plans.

149
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,640
And the interesting thing about this question was that Mr. Campbell said, any vacation plans?

150
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
So that's the whole sentence.

151
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,220
Well, first he says, how about you, Michelle?

152
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,800
Any vacation plans?

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,960
So what we think here is that maybe it's wrong.

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,120
Do you have any vacation plans is something that we'd want to hear, right?

155
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Right.

156
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,000
But here we don't actually need to say, do you have any vacation plans?

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Because it's pretty clear who we're talking to.

158
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,000
We're talking to Michelle, right?

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,880
And we're talking about traveling and we're talking about plans.

161
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,800
So it's overstated that we don't really need to say, do you have any vacation plans?

162
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,440
We're already talking about the subject.

163
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,940
Now, this is a great way to transition.

164
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,120
One person is talking about himself or herself and then you want to talk about the other

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
person.

166
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,760
So you say, what about you?

167
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Any vacation plans or any dinner plans or any ideas?

168
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Exactly.

169
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,000
So it's a great way to, like you say, transition from one idea or from one person to another.

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,960
Now to the next phrase, a very common one, and specifically when you are not really sure

171
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,080
about something, but somebody told you.

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,200
Specifically in this case, Michelle says, I hear it's a wonderful city when talking

173
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,480
about London.

174
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,120
So what does she mean by I hear it's a wonderful city?

175
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,160
Well basically Michelle is saying she's never been to London, but she's read or she's heard

176
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,820
from friends or from a TV show that London's a wonderful city.

177
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,560
So she can't say it is a wonderful city because she's never been there, but she can say, listen,

178
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,060
you know, I have, I have heard this from other people or from magazines.

179
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,440
So it's not even clear where she heard it, but that's not really important.

180
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,880
So basically the idea is that we don't know personally, but we have friends that told

181
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,980
us or we have read in a magazine or a TV show, we've seen it, that it's great.

182
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,720
So you can use it with many things like a restaurant.

183
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
That's right.

184
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I hear the food is delicious.

185
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
Or I could say, hey Marco, I'm going to Hong Kong Disneyland next year.

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Right.

187
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,920
And I can say, oh, I hear that it's a very fun place.

188
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,160
So Marco, you've never been there, right?

189
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
No, I've never been there.

190
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Okay.

191
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
All right.

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,880
And to finish off, Mr. Campbell agrees completely about London being such a wonderful city.

193
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
And he says, I couldn't agree more.

194
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I couldn't agree more.

195
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,400
So he agrees.

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,980
We understand that.

197
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,640
But I couldn't agree more is like saying, I really, really agree.

198
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Right.

199
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,160
Like you are completely right.

200
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah.

201
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,520
So this is a way to exaggerate.

202
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
You know, you want to say, I agree.

203
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Eh, it's a little boring.

204
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,440
So you say, I couldn't agree more.

205
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm agreeing the most I can.

206
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,960
That's right.

207
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,880
And then we can also use the opposite, which would be if you disagree with someone.

208
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,040
I couldn't disagree more.

209
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,840
So you just change that one word.

210
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
I couldn't disagree more.

211
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
So maybe I don't like London.

212
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Maybe it's too rainy or too dark for me.

213
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
So I say, I couldn't disagree more.

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,640
I think London is terrible.

215
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,480
Maybe not the right thing to say in a small talk situation, but we can talk about that

216
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
in a minute.

217
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Exactly.

218
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
All right.

219
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
So let's review everything one last time.

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Hi, ladies.

221
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Thanks for picking me up.

222
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,920
It's awful weather out there.

223
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,540
Absolutely.

224
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,560
It's been raining for hours.

225
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
How are you, Melissa?

226
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Are you okay?

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I'm great.

228
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Thanks, Mr. Campbell.

229
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,240
Do you have any business trips plans in Mr. Campbell?

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Of course.

231
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm always traveling.

232
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm leaving for London next Monday, and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

233
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,120
It's going to be a busy month.

234
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
How about you, Michelle?

235
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,400
Do you have any vacation plans?

236
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes.

237
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,600
Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the spring festival, and hopefully

238
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,360
next year we will visit London.

239
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,840
I hear it's a wonderful city.

240
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,400
I couldn't agree more.

241
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960
London is really fantastic.

242
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
It's my favorite city.

243
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,160
I'm sure you'll have a great time.

244
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,920
All right.

245
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,000
So this is our last podcast all about small talk.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,440
And I hope it's been useful.

247
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,880
We've gotten some great feedback about the different topics and small conversations you

248
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,920
can have with a stranger, a co-worker, a friend, to kind of not have that awkward silence.

249
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
That's right.

250
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,320
We've gone over a lot of different situations.

251
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,160
We've had situations with strangers, situations with work friends.

252
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
But I think what's really important is that in all of these situations, we're very polite.

253
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,440
We say nice things.

254
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,560
There are these transitions like I hear or I couldn't agree more.

255
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,080
These are wonderful ways of really being nice to the person you're talking to.

256
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
That's right.

257
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,800
And we're going to come out with a new series soon.

258
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,040
So we would really like your feedback.

259
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,520
