00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,040
And as you probably noticed on our website, this is one of many different parts of a series

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,000
all about having an interview in English.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
This is a job interview and at this point we're at about part 7.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
That's right.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,360
So today what we're going to talk about is the key question whenever you're having a

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,880
job interview is they ask you to describe your key strengths.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,040
And this is our word for vocabulary preview today so let's take a look at it.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
Okay, so you might have heard the word strength before.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
This is something that you're good at.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,860
And so key strength or key strengths, plural, would be things that you think are most important

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,720
about you as far as the things that you do well.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
That's right.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,400
So as we mentioned, your boss or your potential boss might ask you to describe your key strengths.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,260
So you're going to mention a lot of adjectives, positive adjectives saying how good of a worker

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
you are.

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,400
So why don't we listen to our dialogue.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,920
Let's see what Rebecca has to say about her key strengths and we'll look at those in a

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,280
little bit.

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,040
Okay, Rebecca.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,180
Now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background but what about you

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,540
as a person?

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,360
How would you describe your key strengths?

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm really focused and hardworking.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,400
I think my academic results prove this.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,960
Yes, true.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,720
But how about other personal qualities?

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,080
Well I believe I'm a good team player but I can also work well independently.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,240
I'm very enthusiastic and well, I hope my colleagues would agree, I'm fun to work with.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,640
What would you say is your most positive quality?

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,440
That's a tough question but I would have to say my passion.

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,960
All right so she obviously has a lot of good key strengths.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,360
Why don't we analyze a couple of those on Language Takeaway.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
So one of the first things that Rebecca mentions is that she's really focused.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,520
Okay, so this word focused, what does this mean?

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,800
All right, so if a person is focused, basically you're saying that you concentrate on your

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
work.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,720
That's right and someone who's focused might be very good in a noisy office or in a place

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,160
that is full of distractions like you said because they don't stop their work and think

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,600
about the noise or move around or go talk to people.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,120
Someone who is focused just sits down and can do a lot of work all at once.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,360
That's right, so she describes herself as focused and hardworking.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,680
So hardworking means basically what it sounds like, that someone works very hard.

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,840
That means they put in a lot of hours, they get their work done, they're really, really

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
dependable.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,040
That's right, so as you can see we use the word hardworking together.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,960
So if you work hard, you don't say I work hard.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,460
You can say that but if you want to use it as an adjective, you say I am hardworking.

55
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,720
The opposite of course would be lazy.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
That's right.

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,440
Okay, so we're focused, we're hardworking and she also said that she is a good team

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
player.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,240
Okay, this is a really key phrase here because it's something that employers, so people who

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,660
are hiring new staff like to look out for because most jobs you don't work alone.

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,080
You work with other people and so a team player is someone who works well in a group or works

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
well with others.

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,320
That's right, so a team player, everyone wants to have a good team player working for their

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,000
team, for their company.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,240
And apart from being a good team player, you also want to be enthusiastic.

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,920
That's right, so this means that you are interested in what you do, you are excited about it.

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,560
It's not like oh God, I have to do this report.

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,080
It's like oh wow, I get to do this report, I'm enthusiastic, I'm really interested, I'm

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,340
going to put a lot of energy into it.

70
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
That's right.

71
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,840
So being an enthusiastic person not only can be about working, you can be enthusiastic

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,080
about anything, about painting your house, about going on a trip.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,160
Exactly, enthusiastic.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,200
Alright and our last word for language, takeaway is also a good quality to have if you are

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,940
passionate about what you do or what you're doing.

76
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,760
So someone who is passionate about something really, really likes that thing.

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,220
That means that they love to do it or love to see it.

78
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,320
Passion is the opposite of not interested.

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,480
So you're really, really emotional and excited and interested in something.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,560
That's right, so you are passionate about something.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,320
It comes from the noun passion, so you have a passion for painting, maybe you love to

82
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
paint.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,040
So you're very passionate about painting.

84
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,480
So a lot of great adjectives there to describe yourself in a good way.

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,960
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

86
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,240
Okay Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background,

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
but what about you as a person?

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,000
How would you describe your key strengths?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,240
Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

90
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm really focused and hardworking.

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,080
I think my academic results prove this.

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes, true.

93
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,360
But how about other personal qualities?

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,240
Well I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,880
I'm very enthusiastic and well, I hope my colleagues would agree, I'm fun to work with.

96
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
What would you say is your most positive quality?

97
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,960
Hmm, that's a tough question.

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,080
But I would have to say my passion.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,760
Alright so on Fluency Builder today we've picked out three key phrases.

101
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,280
Let's take a look at the first one.

102
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,920
When Rebecca said, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay so this structure, I'm someone who, is something that you hear a lot of and you can

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,120
actually fill in the end of that sentence with a number of different phrases.

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,560
So in here we heard, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,720
We could also say, I'm someone who needs structure.

107
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Alright so we can also change the verb right from needs to, I'm someone who likes a challenge.

108
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,000
Or maybe Tracy is someone who requires a lot of attention.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,640
Right, so this is a way to introduce a characteristic of yourself.

110
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,600
So you're telling people something about yourself.

111
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,160
Okay, very good.

112
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,960
So moving on, we also saw that Rebecca said that she is fun to work with.

113
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm fun to work with.

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,920
Okay so let's just treat this like a little fixed phrase.

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,640
We say this about people all the time.

116
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,240
He's fun to work with, she's fun to work with, or this group is really fun to work with.

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,720
They're all really fun to work with.

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,680
So that means that it's not serious, that you really enjoy doing it.

119
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,480
So it's a little fixed phrase that you can use to say that it's nice to work with Rebecca

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,720
or that she's very, not serious, not a mean person.

121
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
That's right.

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,960
And finally we have a phrase at the end, Rebecca hears a question she thinks is very difficult,

123
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,080
she calls it a tough question.

124
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,920
And so a tough question is something that is very hard to answer.

125
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,800
That's right, she says, hmm, that's a tough question.

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,080
So she's basically acknowledging the fact that the question is difficult, a tough question.

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,700
Now we can combine this word tough with other things.

128
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,320
That's right, you can say it's a tough situation, that means it's a hard situation to handle.

129
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,200
You could also say he's having a tough time, that means that right now in his life there

130
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,040
are many things that are difficult for him.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,960
And so tough means difficult or hard or unpleasant.

132
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,600
Okay, very good.

133
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,520
So a lot of good stuff coming from Rebecca, mentioning all the positive things about her.

134
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:23,120
Why don't we listen to her dialogue one last time.

135
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
Okay Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,480
what about you as a person?

137
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,280
How would you describe your key strengths?

138
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,560
Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm really focused and hardworking.

140
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,360
I think my academic results prove this.

141
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,880
Yes, true.

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,640
But how about other personal qualities?

143
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,000
Well I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree, I'm fun to work with.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
What would you say is your most positive quality?

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,240
Hmm, that's a tough question.

147
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,360
But I would have to say my passion.

148
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

149
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,120
Alright so talking about key strengths, I think it's always difficult to talk about

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,400
yourself and still sound a little bit humble, right, to not sound arrogant like saying I'm

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
the best.

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Right, well that's the key here I think.

153
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,820
You want to say really good things about yourself because you're a salesperson and you're selling

154
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
your personality.

155
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,960
But at the same time you don't want to sound like a jerk.

156
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Like I'm the best, I'm so smart, I'm so clever.

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,120
That's a little bit off-putting, it makes people uncomfortable.

158
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,560
So I think the trick is a balance.

159
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,440
And I guess if you use words such as this, like you know, I'm focused, I'm hardworking,

160
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm independent, I have a passion for this.

161
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,480
It makes you sound like you're a really good worker but you're not arrogant, you're not

162
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,880
saying oh well, you know, I'm the best of what I do or something like that.

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,040
Right, so you're basically saying these are my skills but obviously I'm not the only person

164
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
who has these great skills.

165
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
That's right.

166
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,360
Okay so that's all the time we have for today.

167
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Be sure to join us next week.

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,280
We're also going to have kind of part two of this when we talk about our weaknesses.

169
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,240
So this time we talked about our strengths, then we'll talk about weaknesses.

170
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
That's right.

171
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,440
So we hope that you will check out our website EnglishPod.com.

172
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,880
If you have questions or comments, leave them there for us and we'll be in touch very soon.

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
All right, we'll see you guys there.

174
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Bye.

175
