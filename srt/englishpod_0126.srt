00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,920
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,240
And today we're going to have a fun, funny lesson.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,240
That's right.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,480
So I think this lesson's going to be a little bit different than most of our lessons, right?

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Right.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
Today we're going to be looking at jokes, which is a very important part of English

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
speaking culture.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,920
So we're actually, we're going to teach you a few pretty hilarious jokes, but we're also

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,400
going to teach you some language related to jokes, funny things, and that sort of stuff.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
All right.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,960
So in order for us to understand a little bit better the jokes that we're going to be

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,320
looking at, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
Two of these words you'll hear in the dialogue, but one you won't, but you still need to know

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
this word so you can understand the jokes.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
All right.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,120
So the word that we're talking about is not really a word.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
It's a sound.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Yeah.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
It's a sound.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Moo.

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Moo.

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,600
So moo is the sound that cows make.

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
That's right.

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
M-O-O.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Right.

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
They go moo.

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Very nice, Marco.

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
I could do a good cow.

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Yep.

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
All right.

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
So we all know now that that's what cows say.

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Exactly.

37
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,480
So it's going to be important for the joke.

38
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
You'll see why.

39
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Okay.

40
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,720
Now another word that you need to understand is a dam.

41
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
So a dam.

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
A dam.

43
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,720
A dam is like a big wall, right?

44
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,560
Well, it's a wall in water that stops the river from flowing.

45
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay.

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
So usually you build dams in rivers and then the water can pass or not.

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Yeah.

48
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,560
It's something that you use to generate electricity, right?

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
Very good.

50
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,840
But there's another word that sounds exactly the same way, but it's just spelled a little

51
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
differently.

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
That's right.

53
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,400
And we might hear someone say, oh, damn.

54
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,920
And that's an interjection, which basically means...

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Oh no.

56
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Right.

57
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
That's terrible.

58
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Yeah.

59
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Damn.

60
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
We're late for the movies.

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Damn.

62
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
We're late for the movie.

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Okay.

64
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,800
So it's an interesting interjection and we'll also see it in one of our jokes.

65
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,600
And now let's move on to our last word.

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Nostrils.

67
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Okay.

68
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Nostrils.

69
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Nostrils.

70
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
So a nostril or your nostrils.

71
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,120
The two holes in your nose.

72
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Right.

73
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
You breathe through your nostrils.

74
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
All right.

75
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,720
So now that we've taken a look at these three words, why don't we listen to our comedian

76
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:29,040
for the first time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

77
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Hello everyone and welcome to Open Mic Night.

78
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,520
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

79
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,520
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert

80
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,840
Hicks.

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Thank you everyone.

82
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, what a lovely crowd.

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,180
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand up comedy.

84
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,840
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now and I've got some real zingers

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,320
for you tonight.

86
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,600
Let's start out with some short jokes.

87
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
How about that?

88
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,920
Where do you find a one-legged dog?

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,400
Where you left it?

90
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Get it?

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
A cloud.

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Tough crowd.

94
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
All right.

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,520
Now, you're going to love this joke.

96
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,560
It's hilarious.

97
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,120
What do cows do for entertainment?

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,120
They rent movies.

99
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Movies.

100
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,640
Okay, okay, okay.

101
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,640
We've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good.

102
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,080
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Damn!

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Get out of here.

105
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay, okay, okay.

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Last one.

107
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,360
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Because they got big fingers.

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840
Thanks, everyone.

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,160
That was my time.

111
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay, so some pretty hilarious jokes, huh?

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,400
I don't think the crowd really enjoyed them all that much.

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,920
Okay, well, maybe I'm just a fan of really terrible jokes.

114
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,160
Well, they were pretty funny, but I guess the crowd just didn't appreciate his sense

115
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
of humor.

116
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
But you know what?

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
They did use quite a lot of really interesting language.

118
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,480
So why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

119
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,600
Language Takeaway.

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,200
On Language Takeaway, we're going to be looking at six words today, so let's get started.

121
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,580
The announcer welcomed everyone and said that it's open mic night.

122
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Open mic night.

123
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,360
So, an open mic night.

124
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
Okay, well, we know mic is short for microphone, right?

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Now, an open mic night is a chance where anyone can come up and talk into the microphone.

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,480
So you can come up and sing or you can tell jokes, you can do anything, basically.

127
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Yeah.

128
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Alright, open mic night.

129
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,840
So it's not for professionals, but for people who maybe want to be professionals.

130
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,220
Right, amateurs.

131
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,000
So it was open mic night and he said they had a lot of great comics there.

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,560
So comics.

133
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
A comic.

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
A comic.

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,360
So basically, a comic is a person that makes a living by making people laugh.

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,280
Yeah, someone who stands up on stage and tells jokes.

137
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Alright.

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
So, a clown is kind of like a comic?

139
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
No, they're different.

140
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
They're different, right?

141
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,120
A comic doesn't wear a red nose and a crazy...

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
A costume.

143
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Yeah.

144
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Alright, yeah, because I hate clowns.

145
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
We do know that about you.

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,040
Alright, so a comic.

147
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,640
And well, what comics do is they perform stand-up comedy.

148
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Stand-up comedy.

149
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Stand-up comedy.

150
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,320
Okay, so stand-up comedy is really exactly what its name suggests, right?

151
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,680
Right, you stand up in front of an audience and you tell jokes or you make them laugh.

152
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Yeah, tell funny stories.

153
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,880
It's a very popular form of entertainment in the United States and the UK.

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
That's right.

155
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,920
And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the lesson, but why don't

156
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,200
we move on to our next word, which is routine.

157
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,260
A routine.

158
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,840
So the guy says, I've been working on my routine.

159
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,280
So what does he mean by his routine?

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,960
Well, I guess a routine is like a series or a collection of jokes or maybe movements that

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,440
you use in a performance.

162
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,460
Alright, a routine.

163
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,040
So you can talk about a dance routine.

164
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,840
Or in this case, a comedy routine.

165
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,800
So the series of jokes he's going to tell.

166
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,480
That's right, that he practices again and again and again.

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Alright, and in his routine, he said he's got a lot of zingers.

168
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Zingers.

169
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,100
A zinger.

170
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
So what's a zinger?

171
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,680
Basically, a zinger is like a strong, maybe a little bit rude joke.

172
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,720
Yeah, but like a kind of a one-line joke, right?

173
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,880
Right, exactly.

174
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,760
And the people that were in the crowd and they were booing him, they were like, boo,

175
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,200
those we call hecklers.

176
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Exactly.

177
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,840
And that's our last word, a heckler.

178
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
A heckler.

179
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Hecklers.

180
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:25,240
So, let's listen to some hecklers in action.

181
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,720
Alright well, I think that's pretty clear.

182
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
Those are definitely hecklers.

183
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,840
Right, they're very annoying.

184
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,080
So now that we've finished looking at all the words that are related to comedy and performances,

185
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,120
let's take a look at the jokes now in Fluency Builder.

186
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Fluency Builder.

187
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, well we're not really focusing on new phrases for you here, but we thought it would

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,560
be helpful to talk a little bit about the jokes to help you understand them, right?

189
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,320
Because they are, well, I think pretty funny.

190
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah, they're pretty funny, but maybe sometimes they're kind of hard to understand.

191
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
So why don't we start with the first joke?

192
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,360
So you said, where do you find a one-legged dog?

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
So what's a one-legged dog?

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,400
Basically, it's a dog that has one leg.

195
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,280
Ah, okay, and the pronunciation here is important, right?

196
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
One-legged.

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
One-legged.

198
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
No.

199
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
One-legged.

200
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,640
So you can say a one-legged dog, a two-legged dog, or a three-legged dog.

201
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Six-legged dog?

202
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
A six-legged spider.

203
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,920
Maybe he lost two legs in a war.

204
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh dear.

205
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay, so the dog obviously didn't go anywhere, and so that's why you find it where you left

206
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
it.

207
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Exactly.

208
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,640
So that's why it's kind of funny.

209
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay.

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,880
All right, so then he said, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
I don't know.

212
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,600
A cloud, basically, because sheep are fluffy and they're white, so if you take away their

213
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
legs, they look like a little cloud.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Boo!

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,560
All right, let's look at the next one.

216
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,360
He asked, what do cows do for entertainment?

217
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,280
And then the answer was, they rent movies.

218
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,340
Exactly.

219
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:04,200
So it's kind of funny because he's relating this word movies with the sound that cows

220
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,480
make, which is moo.

221
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Right.

222
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,240
So there are a million jokes in English following the same pattern, right?

223
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Yeah, exactly.

224
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,320
So I'm sure you can find a lot more of them and you can share them with us.

225
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,640
Now my personal favorite joke is, the guy says, what does a fish say when it runs into

226
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
a wall?

227
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,880
So to run into a wall, basically, to crash against the wall.

228
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Yep.

229
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
So what does the fish say?

230
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Damn.

231
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
So why is this funny?

232
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Why does he say damn?

233
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,160
Well, because, I mean, if you're a person and you run into a wall, damn, like, you know,

234
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,720
it's like, oh no.

235
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Yeah.

236
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,280
But a fish is swimming under the water and like we saw, a dam is actually like a wall

237
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
in the water.

238
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
So he's saying like, a wall.

239
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,400
So I like that one.

241
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
All right.

242
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,040
The last one was pretty good.

243
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,880
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

244
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
Okay, so the big holes in their nose.

245
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Right.

246
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,300
And basically, it's because they have big fingers.

247
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,160
So they can put their fingers in the nose?

248
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Yeah, exactly.

249
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Oh dear.

250
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,080
If he didn't have big nostrils, he wouldn't be able to pick his nose.

251
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,400
Maybe he'd have to use a stick.

252
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,080
Yeah, but that wouldn't be convenient.

253
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
See?

254
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
All right.

255
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
So that's why those jokes are funny.

256
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,560
They're very short jokes.

257
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,480
Of course, some of them are not actually really funny, but it's just a little bit of a taste

258
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,360
of short American jokes.

259
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,980
Okay, well, I think we need to hear them one more time in context so you can all know how

260
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:35,160
funny or maybe not so funny they are.

261
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,440
Hello everyone and welcome to Open Mic Night.

262
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,620
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

263
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,600
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert

264
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Hicks.

265
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Thank you, everyone.

266
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,140
Well, what a lovely crowd.

267
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,280
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand-up comedy.

268
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,940
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now and I've got some real zingers

269
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,420
for you tonight.

270
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,660
Let's start out with some short jokes.

271
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,020
How about that?

272
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,020
Where do you find a one-legged dog?

273
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,480
Where you left it.

274
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Get it?

275
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,300
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

276
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
A cloud.

277
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Tough crowd.

278
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,620
All right, now you're going to love this joke.

279
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,660
It's hilarious.

280
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,220
What do cows do for entertainment?

281
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,220
They rent movies.

282
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,820
Movies.

283
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,740
Okay, okay, okay.

284
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,740
We've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good.

285
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,180
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

286
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,180
Damn!

287
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Get out of here.

288
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Okay, okay, okay.

289
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
Last one.

290
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,460
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

291
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Because they got big fingers.

292
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:28,020
Thanks everyone, that was my time.

293
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,140

Of course, they have to be clean.

297
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Don't come with any...

298
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
No, yeah, no swears.

299
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,020
No swearing in the jokes.

300
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
Yep.

301
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,420
All right, so we'll see you guys there and until next time.

302
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420

Bye.
