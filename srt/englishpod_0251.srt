00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
My name is Catherine and today we're talking a little bit about, well, kind of girly things.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
That's right.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,900
We've talked about guys' shoes, women's shoes.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,480
So now we're going to talk about another aspect of women's accessories.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,800
We're going to talk about makeup.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Okay, so we're wearing makeup today.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,080
Actually we're buying makeup at the store.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,960
I never even knew there were so many kinds of makeup.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,440
So we're going to learn all about these in today's dialogue.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm hungry.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,880
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,240
Yeah, me too.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,440
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,000
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,640
Will you take long?

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,080
No, five minutes.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,920
I promise.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Come on.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
We've been here for almost an hour.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,840
I thought you said you were only going to get a few things.

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,600
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,160
Are you crazy?

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,040
You have no idea what you're talking about.

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,560
Just for my eyes I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil,

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
and mascara.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,320
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,240
Are you nuts?

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,040
How much is all this going to cost?

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,560
This is basically a crayon.

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,840
What about you?

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,280
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne, and gel.

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,600
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and...

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Fine.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,840
Alright, we're back.

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,240
So obviously we're getting a lot of things for this girl, a lot of makeup.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,480
So I think there are a couple of things that we may not know about.

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,680
So let's take a look at them now on Language Takeaway.

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,000
Language Takeaway.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,920
So the first thing we're talking about today is a basic.

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
Most women carry this around in their purses.

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
It's called lipstick.

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
That's right.

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,760
And as you said, this is a pretty basic thing.

49
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,120
It's the kind of like paint that you put on your lips.

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,680
And it's called a lipstick because it looks like a little stick.

51
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,120
Right, and you turn it with your fingers and it comes up and then you turn it again and

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,760
it goes down, basically keeping it from touching all of the things in your purse.

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
That's right.

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
So lipstick.

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,280
And well, apart from this, we also have nail polish.

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,800
And this is also very popular with the ladies when you paint your nails a certain color.

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
That's right.

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
So polish is basically anything that makes something shiny.

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,340
It's something that you add to surfaces.

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,640
So you could add polish to wood on a table.

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,760
But in this case, we're putting it on our nails.

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,860
That is fingernails or toenails.

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,120
So it's nail polish.

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
Alright, very good.

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,760
And now we're getting into the specific things.

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,080
A lot of makeup that women use on their eyes.

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,320
So for example, the first thing she said, she needs to get an eyeliner.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,040
Okay, so eyeliner is basically a pencil.

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,520
This is what the guy is making fun of her about.

70
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,120
He says it's just a pencil or a crayon for your eye.

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,160
And so basically, you use it to draw a line on the top or the bottom of your eye, your

72
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
eyelid.

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,760
Okay, so yeah, it kind of looks like a marker and it comes, I think, black and different

74
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
colors and then you paint little lines around your eyes to make them more pronounced.

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,240
So it's called an eyeliner.

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,960
Okay, and now we have an eyelash curler.

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,840
And also, I think this is very important for the ladies.

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah, well not everyone uses this.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
It's a little bit of a scary instrument.

80
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,960
It looks like it might pop your eye out.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,580
It's something you use on your eyelashes.

82
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,040
So those are the hairs that come off of your eye.

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:51,280
And basically, you use this to make them curly or to make them seem a bit longer and prettier.

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,600
So an eyelash curler is something that, it's almost like a press or something for your

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
eyelashes.

86
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
Okay, very good.

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,040
And well, now that we've got that covered, we move on to eye shadow.

88
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,280
And I think this goes on your eyelid, right?

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
That's right.

90
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Some people make it go further.

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,440
They put it on their face above their eyelid, but that's a little bit crazy.

92
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,880
I think eye shadow generally goes, like you said, on your eyelid.

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,400
And it can be in many different colors.

94
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,080
So blue, pink, red, whatever.

95
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,560
People sometimes go crazy with eye shadow.

96
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Okay.

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,640
And now what about an eyebrow pencil?

98
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,480
This is basically a pencil for filling in or for coloring your eyebrows.

99
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,680
Sometimes people like to make their eyebrows look darker or thicker.

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,760
And so they use this pencil.

101
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,820
It's usually brown or black.

102
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,600
And they use it on their eyebrows.

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,960
So we've picked up a lot of vocab here related to your eye.

104
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,320
For example, an eyelash, your eyelid.

105
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,120
Now we're talking about the eyebrows, which are the hairs on top, more or less around

106
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,760
your forehead.

107
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,360
And now we also have another type of makeup called mascara.

108
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
This is another basic.

109
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,120
So like we said earlier, lipstick is something you almost always find in a woman's purse.

110
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Well, mascara is another one of those things.

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,280
Almost everybody wears mascara.

112
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,960
This is kind of like a brush for your eyelashes and it paints them a different color.

113
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,080
So most women wear black or brown and it makes your eyelashes look really long.

114
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, okay.

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Very good.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,440
So this is kind of like paint for your eyelashes.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,200
And now moving away from your eyelashes, we're going to have, we're buying also some foundation

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,760
and liquid foundation.

119
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Okay.

120
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,740
So foundation is just a kind of base for your face.

121
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,440
So foundation, like a building, is the very bottom.

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,520
Well, in this case, it's something that you put on your cheeks, on your face in general,

123
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,280
on your forehead to kind of smooth your skin out and make it look all the same color or

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,120
the same texture.

125
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,880
And so foundation can be like we see here, either a powder, which is kind of like a dry

126
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,600
substance, or you can use liquid foundation, which is like it says, liquid.

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,120
It's almost like a thick cream.

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,280
All right.

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,040
So foundation is, as you said, I guess you just want to make your skin look the same

130
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,400
color, the same texture, because obviously not everyone's skin is perfect.

131
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,120
We all have some spots maybe, or some different color on our face.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,920
You say we like you wear foundation too.

133
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Do you wear makeup, Marco?

134
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,320
Well, I mean, we as people because, you know.

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
All right.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,080
No, no, no, no, none of this makeup for me, although I have used an eyelash curler once.

137
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
That's scary.

138
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,800
Well, my friends dared me to, so okay.

139
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
And you loved it.

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Of course.

141
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Now I use it all the time.

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
No, no.

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,480
But what I do use is now things related to guys.

144
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,040
So for example, the girlfriend was saying, well, you buy razors and aftershave.

145
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,360
So what are these things?

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Well, razors aren't just a guy thing.

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Everyone can have a razor.

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,640
It's basically a blade, like a very sharp piece of metal that you use to cut hair.

149
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,080
So the hair on your legs, the hair on your face, these are things that you cut with a

150
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
razor.

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,920
And men use razors to shave their faces, shave their chins or above their lip.

152
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
All right.

153
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,480
And well, actually, after we shave our beard, we put on a little bit of aftershave, which

154
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,400
is basically kind of like alcohol that smells really nice.

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
That's right, because shaving can actually hurt your skin or the hairs under your skin

156
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,440
can become really itchy or irritated.

157
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,040
And so aftershave helps make everything feel better.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay.

159
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,360
Well, and sometimes we also use a little bit of cologne to smell nice.

160
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,400
So women usually wear perfume, which is, you know, the perfumes like CK and Hugo Boss and

161
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,360
all that stuff, as well as for guys, it's usually called cologne.

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Okay, that's right.

163
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,280
It's an important difference there because we don't say perfume for guys and we don't

164
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,940
say cologne for girls.

165
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,280
So women wear perfume, like you said, but men wear cologne.

166
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
And this word is very funny looking.

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,880
It ends with, it's spelled C-O-L-O-G-N-E.

168
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,400
So you don't really say the G, it's not cologna.

169
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Right.

170
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
It's cologne.

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
And it's something that you put on your neck or your face to smell really good if you're

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
a man.

173
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Exactly.

174
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,360
And finally, if you have long hair or maybe you have very spiky hair like I do, you need

175
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,840
to wear a little bit of gel to kind of give your head a little bit of shape.

176
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
That's right.

177
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,880
So gel is actually the name of a kind of substance.

178
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,040
It's not liquid, but it's not hard either.

179
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,440
And it's basically thick like paste that you put in your hair to keep it in one place.

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,960
Yeah, it makes your hair become a little bit hard or it keeps your hairstyle in for a long

181
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
time.

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
That's right.

183
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,640
All right, so a lot of vocab here, a lot of things that we've picked up.

184
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:50,720
Why don't we go back, review all this great vocab on our dialogue for today.

185
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm hungry.

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

187
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,560
Yeah, me too.

188
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

189
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,320
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

190
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,960
Will you take long?

191
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,400
No, five minutes.

192
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I promise.

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,880
Come on, we've been here for almost an hour.

194
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,400
I thought you said you're only going to get a few things.

195
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,200
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

196
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,720
Are you crazy?

197
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,600
You have no idea what you're talking about.

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,200
First for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow

199
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
pencil, and mascara.

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

201
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

202
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
Are you nuts?

203
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
How much is all this going to cost?

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

205
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,120
This is basically a crayon.

206
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
What about you?

207
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,840
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne, and gel.

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,280
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and-

209
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,960
Fine, get the stupid $30 crayon.

210
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,160
All right, we're back.

211
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,400
So now we're going to take a look at three short phrases that we've picked out for you

212
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,560
on Fluency Builder.

213
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Fluency Builder.

214
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,840
So this first phrase is something that we almost always say with our friends or family

215
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,560
when we're hungry, we're shopping.

216
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,080
Sometimes you're outside and you just really want to eat.

217
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,120
You say, hey, let's grab a bite to eat.

218
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
That's right.

219
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,960
It's a very natural colloquial way of saying, let's go get something to eat or let's go

220
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,040
eat something.

221
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,920
So it could be small, it could be a snack like an ice cream, but it can also be dinner.

222
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
So hey, do you want to go grab a bite to eat sometime?

223
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,960
That means, hey, you want to go have lunch or dinner sometime?

224
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Very good.

225
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,960
So the phrase is grab a bite or go grab a bite to eat.

226
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,840
So a bite can be a noun, like a thing, like a piece of food that you eat, but it can also

227
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,360
be a verb, to bite, like the dog bites the man.

228
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,600
And so you have to be careful with this one.

229
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,920
In this case, it's a noun.

230
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,520
Okay, very good.

231
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,080
And well, she wanted to first go to the store and she said, I want to pick up a few things.

232
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,280
Well, usually when you pick something up, you take it from a table or from the ground.

233
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,240
But in this case, it means to buy something because you can't just pick something up in

234
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
a store and then walk away.

235
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,840
You have to pay for it.

236
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,560
So for example, you can say, when you come home, can you pick up a carton of milk?

237
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,960
So that means, can you buy some milk on your way home?

238
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,880
It doesn't mean, can you take some from someone else or steal some.

239
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Exactly.

240
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,600
All right, so to pick something up, to buy, to go and get, but obviously you have to pay.

241
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,680
All right, and he used this very interesting phrase when she was getting all these things

242
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
for her.

243
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,480
He said, whoa, whoa, whoa, are you nuts?

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
Okay, so nuts is the important word here.

245
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,280
It means crazy or out of your mind.

246
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
That's right.

247
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,860
So it's another way of saying crazy.

248
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,440
So if you call someone nuts or you say, he's nuts, that means.

249
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, like don't talk to him.

250
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
He's nuts.

251
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,680
Or he always says really dangerous things.

252
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
He's nuts.

253
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,800
So he's a little bit crazy.

254
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,560
So it's an adjective as to describe someone that's a little bit crazy or a little bit

255
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,000
adventurous maybe.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,520
But in this case, he's not actually saying she's a crazy person.

257
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,880
He's saying, listen, this is so much stuff.

258
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Are you crazy?

259
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
Or he's basically saying, do you really want to do this?

260
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
This seems like a bad decision.

261
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Exactly.

262
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,120
So that's why he used the phrase, are you nuts?

263
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,400
Okay, so a lot of great stuff there.

264
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:30,240
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit.

265
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I'm hungry.

266
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

267
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
Yeah, me too.

268
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,280
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

269
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,840
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

270
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Will you take long?

271
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,920
No, five minutes.

272
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,760
I promise.

273
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Come on, we've been here for almost an hour.

274
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,660
I thought you said you're only going to get a few things.

275
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,440
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

276
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,980
Are you crazy?

277
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,840
You have no idea what you're talking about.

278
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,160
As for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner and eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil

279
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
and mascara.

280
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

281
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

282
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,080
Are you nuts?

283
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,880
How much is all this going to cost?

284
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

285
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,400
This is basically a crayon.

286
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,680
What about you?

287
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,140
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne and gel.

288
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,480
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and-

289
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:38,920
Fine, get the stupid $30 crayon.

290
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,760
All right, so talking about makeup, a lot of things here.

291
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,400
Maybe I didn't mention a couple of things.

292
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,040
I don't know.

293
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,480
We took a look at the most important things, I think, right?

294
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,360
But you also mentioned something, for example, cover-up.

295
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
There's something, such makeup called cover-up.

296
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah, so cover-up.

297
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,520
It could be a couple of different things in English, for example, something that you wear

298
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
to cover your body when you're at the beach.

299
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,040
You don't want to walk around and everyone can see you in your bathing suit.

300
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,280
But when we're talking about makeup, a cover-up is a thing that we use to hide blemishes or

301
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,920
zits or pimples.

302
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,000
You know when you get a really small red dot on your face and you're embarrassed and it's

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
ugly, and you don't want anyone to see it?

304
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Well, cover-up is a kind of makeup you use that looks like your skin color and you put

305
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,000
it on top and you can't see the red anymore.

306
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, so you cover up your pimple.

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
Yeah, or you use cover-up.

308
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
It's a noun too.

309
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay, and I've also seen that, well, many girls don't really wear too much lipstick

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
anymore nowadays.

311
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,160
They use this thing called lip gloss.

312
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,360
Okay, lip gloss.

313
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,400
Remember we were talking about polish earlier?

314
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,240
Well, gloss is a similar word.

315
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,720
It means something that makes another thing shiny.

316
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,960
And so lipstick can be very dry, can be very flat, but lip gloss is something that makes

317
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,480
things look wet, makes things look shiny.

318
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,960
Okay, and actually one last thing before, when we talked about gel, I guess guys use

319
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,280
gel but women use this thing called mousse.

320
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,360
Or they could use gel too.

321
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,760
I don't think it's gender specific, but a lot of people use mousse.

322
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,080
I know some men who use mousse as well.

323
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,720
Mousse is kind of like a foam.

324
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,160
You know it comes in a can and it goes ffff.

325
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah, and it inflates this white substance.

326
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,280
Yeah, it looks like, I don't know.

327
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Like whipped cream.

328
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Like whipped cream, yeah.

329
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,120
And you put it in your hair and it's very fluffy.

330
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,460
And it's actually less strong.

331
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,600
It's not like gel because if you put it in your hair, your hair won't look hard.

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,720
But it will help shape your hair if you want to keep your hair in one place.

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,920
A lot of things here.

334
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,040
I think in beauty and cosmetics, we have a lot of a lot of things.

335
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,720
And probably we didn't even touch on half of the things that are out there.

336
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,880
So if you have any questions or if you want to ask us anything at all about this lesson

Alright, bye everyone!
