00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,920
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,320
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,040
And today we're going to be talking about a very special topic.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,040
That's right.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,600
This topic was actually suggested by one of our listeners.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,600
Exactly.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,920
So keep those comments coming because we want to create lessons that you need, that

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
you want.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
Exactly.

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,720
So what are we talking about today?

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,640
Today's lesson is about applying for a visa.

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,920
A very, very important topic.

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Yes.

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,080
And specifically, it's about a visa interview.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Exactly.

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,000
As you all probably know, when you apply for a visa, especially for the US, you have an

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
interview.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Where you have to answer some questions.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,480
And that's what we're going to be talking about today.

24
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,520
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Vocabulary preview.

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Okay.

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,240
So let's talk about visa.

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Right.

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,520
A visa, it's not a credit card.

30
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,240
No, not visa or MasterCard.

31
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
No.

32
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,720
A visa is an official document that you get in your passport that allows you to travel

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,360
legally to a country.

34
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Exactly.

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,640
So with this document, you can go into a country.

36
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Okay.

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
So we have different types of visas.

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
Today we're going to be talking about a B2 visa.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,480
A B2 visa is a tourist visa.

41
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
A tourist visa.

42
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Yeah.

43
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
This is only for the United States.

44
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,120
Other countries may have different classifications for their visas, but B2 is for the United

45
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
States.

46
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Right.

47
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,680
So we have a tourist visa when we want to be a tourist and just travel in the US.

48
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,320
What about a resident visa?

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,880
Well, you can have a temporary resident visa.

50
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,480
Like for example, an F1.

51
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Yep.

52
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,040
An F1 is for foreign exchange students who go and live in the States maybe for a year

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
or do a MBA for two years or three years.

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,120
So that's an F1 visa.

55
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,680
You can also get a J1 visa, which is a temporary exchange visitor.

56
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Okay.

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,560
So that would be to maybe do some temporary work for two or three months and then go back

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
to your country.

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
So basically a resident visa allows you to live in that country.

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Yeah.

61
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,720
You can live in that country legally for a determined time.

62
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Okay.

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
So let's listen to our dialogue.

64
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,920
Where are we going to be exactly?

65
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,340
In this dialogue, we're going to hear two people, a visa officer and a person who's

66
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,880
applying for the visa.

67
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Now, the person who's applying for the visa has an accent, right?

68
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Yes.

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,960
So that's really good practice for helping you to understand people with different accents.

70
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Exactly.

71
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:45,360
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the great vocabulary.

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,360
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm going to visit my brother.

75
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,480
He's just had a baby.

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,520
He lives in Minneapolis.

77
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,480
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,460
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

79
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,840
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

80
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,960
And who's sponsoring your trip?

81
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
My brother here.

82
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,880
This is an invitation letter from him.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,400
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,720
All right.

85
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,840
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
Well, I own a house.

87
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,080
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

88
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,760
I have a car at home.

89
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,320
I know my job.

90
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm employed by Tornell as an engineer.

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,400
Actually, I only have three week vacation.

92
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,440
So I have to go back to work at the end of March.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,320
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

94
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,360
Well, I do have assets in my country.

95
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Like I said, I own a house and see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,600
my bank balance.

97
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm sorry, sir.

98
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,560
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

99
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,880
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

100
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Congratulations.

101
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,160
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

102
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
You win.

103
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Congratulations.

104
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
All right.

105
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,240
What a lucky guy.

106
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,840
He applied for a tourist visa and now he's getting a resident visa.

107
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,560
Yeah, that's that's great.

108
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,680
But does this really happen?

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
No.

110
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
No, no.

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,280
It doesn't happen at a consulate.

112
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Okay.

113
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,720
Well, we can we can dream that this might happen for us.

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Yeah, exactly.

115
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
All right.

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,760
Let's take a look at the words in Language Takeaway today.

117
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Language Takeaway.

118
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
All right.

119
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,280
On Language Takeaway, we have sponsoring.

120
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Sponsoring.

121
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Sponsoring.

122
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Sponsoring.

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,600
So, Erika, what does it mean to sponsor somebody?

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
When you sponsor somebody for a visa, you take care of them and make sure they have

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
enough money.

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Okay.

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,460
So, you are the one who's responsible for all of their expenses and making sure they

128
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,800
just have enough money.

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Okay.

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,040
So, for example, when I was 16, I made a trip to another country.

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Yep.

132
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
And my parents were my sponsors.

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,880
So, they took responsibility for your money.

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Exactly.

135
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Okay.

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Let's look at our next word.

137
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Invitation Letter.

138
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,720
Invitation Letter.

139
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,800
Invitation Letter.

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Invitation Letter.

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Now, this is a really important part for a visa application.

142
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes.

143
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Very important.

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
What is an Invitation Letter?

145
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,240
Well, an Invitation Letter is a formal letter that a friend or a relative or maybe a business

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,680
writes to ask you to come to their country.

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Exactly.

148
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,320
So, you're being invited for a specific purpose to the United States.

149
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Yeah.

150
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,600
And you have to give this letter to the visa officer.

151
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Okay.

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,160
Invitation Letter.

153
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,640
Our next word.

154
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Ties.

155
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Ties.

156
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Ties.

157
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
What are ties?

158
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,000
It looks exactly like tie, like the one you wear in your suit.

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Not quite the same though.

160
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right.

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
So, what are ties?

162
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,920
The ties you have to your country are the things that keep you attached to your country.

163
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Okay.

164
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,760
That make sure that you will return to your country.

165
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Okay.

166
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,720
So, what are some examples of ties?

167
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,520
Like maybe a house or a wife or a child or maybe some money in your bank account.

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Okay.

169
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Or a job even.

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Okay.

171
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Okay.

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,720
So, a good way to think of this is imagine like a rope that's attached to you and tying

173
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
you to your country, to your house, to your job, to your kids.

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay.

175
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
So, you can't run away.

176
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Exactly.

177
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Okay.

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Okay.

179
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,040
That was clear but let's listen to some more examples of how we would use ties.

180
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,200
Example one.

181
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,680
I sold my house and closed my bank account.

182
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,840
I don't have any more ties to my home country.

183
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,360
Example two.

184
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Alvin enjoyed being single.

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,560
He wasn't ready for the ties of family life.

186
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,960
Example three.

187
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,480
Diplomatic relations have improved and the ties between the two countries are stronger.

188
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,120
Alright.

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
It's clear now.

190
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,440
Let's look at our next word.

191
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,160
Financially independent.

192
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,880
So that means that you don't need anyone.

193
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
That you have enough money.

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,280
You have enough money for yourself.

195
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Right.

196
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,720
So, you don't have to ask your parents to pay for your ticket or pay for your food or

197
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
whatever.

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Okay.

199
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,200
And our last word for today.

200
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Assets.

201
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Assets.

202
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Assets.

203
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Assets.

204
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay.

205
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,960
So, your assets are kind of like your ties.

206
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Right.

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,160
So, things of value that you own.

208
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,400
Things that are expensive that you own in your home country.

209
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,840
So, it would be a house.

210
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Yep.

211
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
A car.

212
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Yep.

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Maybe stocks.

214
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Stocks.

215
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Or investments.

216
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Okay.

217
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
So, all of those things are your assets.

218
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Okay.

219
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,960
So, we've seen a lot of great words and I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue

220
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
again.

221
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,440
We're going to slow it down for you.

222
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah.

223
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:12,760
So, you'll understand it a little bit better.

224
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,960
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

225
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,720
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

226
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm going to visit my brother.

227
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,840
He's just had a baby.

228
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,320
He lives in Minneapolis.

229
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,840
Because how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

230
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,520
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

231
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,880
See, here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,160
And who is sponsoring your trip?

233
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
My brother.

234
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Here.

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,200
This is an invitation letter from him.

236
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,400
I'll stay with him and his family in their home.

237
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
All right.

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,520
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

239
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,160
Well, I own a house.

240
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
I have a car at home.

242
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,560
I know, my job.

243
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm employed by Torneo as an engineer.

244
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,720
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation.

245
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,280
So I have to go back to work at the end of March.

246
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,840
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

247
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, I do have assets in my country.

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
Like I said, I own a house.

249
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,200
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

250
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm sorry, sir.

251
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,200
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

252
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,560
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

253
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,040
Congratulations!

254
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,640
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

255
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
You win!

256
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Congratulations!

257
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Yay!

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Okay, today we're not going to do a regular toolkit like fluency builder or putting it

259
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
together.

260
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,400
No, we're going to do something a little bit different today.

261
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,640
We're going to talk about the questions you will probably be asked at an interview for

262
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,040
a US visa.

263
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Yes.

264
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,920
And the useful language that you can use to answer these questions in a good way.

265
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,560
Okay, so let's take a look at our first question.

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,520
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

267
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

268
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,840
So this is probably going to be the first question the interviewer is going to ask you.

269
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, so Marco, I know you have a lot of experience with US visas.

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,280
How should we answer this question?

271
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,120
Well, it depends on what you're doing, right?

272
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,720
So, if you're a tourist, you would say, I'm going on vacation to New York or anywhere.

273
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
Also, if you're visiting a family member, like in our dialogue, you would say, oh, I'm

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
going to visit my sister or my brother or my cousin.

275
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,160
If you're applying for a business visa, then you would say, oh, I'm going to visit a company

276
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
or etc.

277
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,880
So you just have to say why you are going to the States.

278
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,200
Now, is it important to be really specific?

279
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,840
Yeah, the more specific you are, it's probably better.

280
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,720
So if you can name the state and the city where you're going, it's much better.

281
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Okay.

282
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,000
So let's listen to our next question.

283
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,880
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

284
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,080
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

285
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Okay, so this is a really important question also because in your application, you have

286
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,440
to put how long you plan to stay in the US.

287
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Right.

288
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,960
It's a pretty straightforward answer.

289
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,520
You know, two months, one month, three weeks.

290
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Right.

291
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,480
But you just have to make sure that your answer matches what's written in your application

292
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
form.

293
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Yeah, exactly.

294
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,040
Okay, now let's take a look at our last question.

295
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,660
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

296
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,880
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

297
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,640
Well, I think this is maybe the most important question that they'll ask you, right?

298
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah, this is the most important question.

299
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,320
This is what the interviewer is most interested in.

300
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Okay.

301
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,920
So why is he interested in this?

302
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,960
Because he has to be sure that you will not become an illegal immigrant to the United

303
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
States.

304
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,000
So that you will return to your home country.

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Exactly.

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,240
He or she has to be convinced that you're going to return to your home country.

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,840
So how can you convince him?

308
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,960
Basically, by demonstrating your ties.

309
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,200
So showing the things that will pull you back to your home country.

310
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,720
So if you take documents to support this, bank statements, maybe a copy of your mortgage.

311
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah, like maybe your wedding certificate.

312
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,760
I don't know, even a letter from your office, from your job.

313
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,720
So that shows that you have to return to your work.

314
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,680
The more things you bring, the better, even though the interviewer might not ask for the

315
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
documents.

316
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,080
Okay, it's just better to be safe, right?

317
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Exactly.

318
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,960
So come with a huge file full of things.

319
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Exactly.

320
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,560
I've had friends who've arrived to the embassy with a huge file of documents and weren't

321
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,320
asked to show any of the documents.

322
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
But other interviewers will maybe ask for it.

323
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,680
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue again.

324
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:28,840
And you'll hear how our traveler answers these questions.

325
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,160
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

326
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,840
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

327
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to visit my brother.

328
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,960
He's just had a baby.

329
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,000
He lives in Minneapolis.

330
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,960
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

332
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,320
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

333
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
And who's sponsoring your trip?

334
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
My brother here.

335
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,400
This is an invitation letter from him.

336
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,840
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

337
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
All right.

338
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,440
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

339
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
Well, I own a house.

340
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,600
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

341
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,280
I have a car at home.

342
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,840
I know my job.

343
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,240
I'm employed by Tornell as an engineer.

344
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,920
Actually, I only have three week vacation.

345
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,960
So I have to go back to work at the end of March.

346
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,880
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

347
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Well, I do have assets in my country.

348
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,840
Like I said, I own a house and see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and

349
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,160
my bank balance.

350
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm sorry, sir.

351
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,120
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,320
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

353
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Congratulations.

354
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,720
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

355
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
You win.

356
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Congratulations.

357
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:57,280
Well, I hope this was a useful lesson for all of our listeners because I'm sure that

358
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,480
in one point or another, in the future, you're going to apply for a visa.

359
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,000
So now you know all the language that you need to more or less answer all these questions

360
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that you're going to be asked.

361
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes.

362
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,120
And I'm sure that people have already applied for visas for the US, right?

363
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Probably, yeah.

364
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,800
And I want to hear from our users any stories that they have about applying for a visa.

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah, that would be great.

366
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,840
I know that I have some stories to share on the comments board.

367
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,920
And we want to hear your questions and comments and any suggestions.

368
