00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,820
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:10,220
My name is Kathryn and today we're going to be helping you find someone to help out around

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,220
the house.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,220
That's right.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,040
So we're looking for someone to help us do some things around the house.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
So we're going to talk about this more in depth.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,320
But first, let's take a look at one word on vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,420
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,840
So the beginning of today's dialogue has to do with a newspaper ad.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,060
We are writing an ad for the newspaper.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,480
Now what exactly is a newspaper ad, Marco?

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
That's right.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,900
So in the newspapers, usually there is a section called the classifieds where people post ads

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:49,120
or advertisements or adverts where maybe they're selling their car or they're looking to hire

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,300
people.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,280
So this is what a newspaper ad is.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
You're selling something, you're buying something or maybe you want to hire people, etc.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,320
It is basically an advertisement in the newspaper to find help.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
All right.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,140
So let's listen to our dialogue and when we come back, we'll be talking more about the

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,640
words and phrases you've heard.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,560
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Sure.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,440
What are you looking to buy or sell?

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,840
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,800
Oh, you want to get a maid?

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,360
Okay.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,120
So what do you want her to do?

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,520
Well, let's see.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,400
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
and maybe do some cooking.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Got it.

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
And how much do you offer per month?

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
I would pay her hourly.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,400
I don't know what the going rate is though.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,720
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
person that answers the ad.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Great.

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
I'll try to help.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,480
All right, we're back.

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,000
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,520
So first of all today, Marco, the advertisement is about wanting to hire someone.

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,040
Now, this is an important verb, especially when we're trying to find help.

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
The verb to hire.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
That's right.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,800
So to hire means to give someone work, to offer a contract to someone.

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Okay.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,240
So my boss hired me three years ago.

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,440
That means he gave me a job three years ago.

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
That's right.

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
But this is not just for office jobs.

56
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,240
This is for all kinds of jobs.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,920
So what about cutting your grass or doing your lawn?

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
That's right.

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,840
So you can hire a gardener, for example, and it's basically the same thing.

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,120
It means that you're going to pay someone to work for you.

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Okay.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,080
So let's say you wanted to hire a maid, M-A-I-D, a maid.

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
But this is a little bit old fashioned, this word.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,720
What does a maid do or what did a maid do?

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,360
Well, a maid is basically a woman, a female servant, so to say, a person that basically

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
serves you.

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
All right.

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,940
So she cleans the house.

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,920
She maybe puts the covers on the beds, washes the dishes, cooks, does all of these domestic

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
things.

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
So she works around the house.

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,640
But because there's a bad association, we don't like to think, oh, we have servants.

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,240
We don't say maid anymore.

74
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,880
We have two other ways of saying this word.

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
That's right.

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,720
So we could say that we want to hire a cleaning lady, right?

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,080
Or we want to hire domestic help.

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Okay.

79
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,160
Now there's an important difference between these two words.

80
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,000
First of all, cleaning lady is a woman, a lady, and she is someone who only cleans.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,240
She doesn't take care of your children.

82
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
She doesn't walk your dogs.

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,440
She basically just cleans the house, washes the dishes, cleans the clothes, washes the

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
floors.

85
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,240
So she's a cleaning lady.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Now domestic help, this is a little bit more general.

87
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Right.

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,920
So domestic help would be a little bit more in depth of what the person's going to do.

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,200
So we'll help with the domestic work, with domestic meaning the house.

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,360
So this person will maybe cook for you, clean the house, take care of the kids, do everything

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
that is associated with the house.

92
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,960
So it's important to see that domestic means something that has to do with the house.

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,560
This is help man or woman in the house.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Right.

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
All right.

96
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
So that's all we have for language takeaway, but we do have another section, Fluency Builder,

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,360
in which we're going to look at some great words and phrases.

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,840
Fluency Builder.

99
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
All right.

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,920
So first on Fluency Builder, let's take a look at how we're going to pay the person

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,440
because obviously we were saying that we want to hire this person.

102
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,860
We're going to pay them.

103
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,220
So how are we going to pay them?

104
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,640
The person said, I would pay the woman her hourly.

105
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,800
I would pay her hourly.

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,860
So this is the rate.

108
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,120
This is how much she will be paid.

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,920
And we don't say she will be paid $10,000 per year.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,000
We say she'll be paid $10 per hour.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,120
So we pay per hour.

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,040
This is paying her hourly.

113
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Right.

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,320
So if you have an hourly wage, that means that you get paid per hour.

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,280
In contrast with a salary, that means that you would get a fixed amount every month.

116
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
All right.

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,420
So if the monthly salary is $1,000, for example, you could break that down and say, but every

118
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,840
day you earn 100.

119
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,040
You work 10 days.

120
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,900
But if it's hourly, you say you'll get paid $10 per hour.

121
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,080
So if you work four hours today, you will earn $40.

122
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
That's right.

123
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Okay.

124
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,600
So now we want to pay the cleaning lady hourly, but we don't know what the going rate is.

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Going rate.

126
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Going.

127
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,720
So this is an interesting phrase and it's important to notice that it's not going rate

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,120
is an amount of money, but it's not always the same.

129
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Right.

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
It depends on the industry.

131
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,640
So the going rate for a teacher is different from the going rate for a cleaning lady,

132
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,920
which is different from the going rate for a language tutor.

133
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Right.

134
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,700
Or like an English tutor.

135
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,000
So first of all, the going rate is how much these people, these cleaning ladies normally

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
earn.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's an average.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Right.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,040
So you would usually calculate it, say the approximate going rate is between maybe $8

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,880
to $10 per hour.

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
So it's not like an exact amount.

142
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,960
You would say the going rate is more or less a certain amount.

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,280
It's not exact.

144
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
So you might ask your friends, what do you pay your cleaning lady?

145
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,640
And one friend says, oh, I pay $12 per hour.

146
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,440
And my other friend says, oh, I pay about $8 per hour.

147
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,440
So to me, it sounds like the going rate is about $10 per hour.

148
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Right.

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Exactly.

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,320
So we're not really sure what the going rate is.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
So our friend says, well, you know what?

152
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm sure it's more than minimum wage.

153
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,640
Now minimum wage is actually something that the government decides on or either the federal

154
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,840
government in America or the state.

155
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,320
And each state will have a number that they say that is the least you can pay a person

156
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
per hour.

157
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Right.

158
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Right.

159
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
So it is the law.

160
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,440
If you pay less, it's illegal.

161
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,760
And this is because we expect everyone to be treated fairly.

162
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Right.

163
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Right.

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
So it's not an advantage of people.

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
No.

166
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,840
And so, for example, in America, in my state, Illinois, I think the minimum wage is $7.25

167
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
per hour.

168
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Oh, really?

169
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Wow.

170
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
It's pretty high.

171
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,800
And this is because people need to pay for health care and cars and houses and children.

172
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,640
So we say the least you can pay someone is $7.25.

173
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Now this is different.

174
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,600
As you said, it could be different from state to state.

175
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Right.

176
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,840
Because I know in some states, if I'm not mistaken, it's like $5.50 or something.

177
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
Yeah, some states it's $5.

178
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
It depends on the cost of living.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,720
If it's cheap to rent an apartment or to find transportation, then obviously the minimum

180
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,280
wage is going to be lower.

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,000
Obviously there's no maximum wage.

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,960
There's no number that is the most you can pay someone.

183
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,920
But all states have a minimum wage.

184
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,880
It's the least that you can pay someone per hour.

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Okay.

186
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,400
So for our last phrase, we don't know what the minimum wage is, we're not really sure

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
what the going rate is.

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,240
So we should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

189
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
All right.

190
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,840
Now to negotiate is a great verb.

191
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,960
It is something that all of us do all the time.

192
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,480
So to negotiate means to try and compromise or to reach an agreement.

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,160
So maybe I say the most I will pay is $11.

194
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,960
So I say, okay, I'll pay you $9.

195
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,600
And I say, no, I'll take 12.

196
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,080
Yeah, sorry, 12 is too much.

197
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
I'll pay you 10.

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,880
Okay, 11.

199
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
11?

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay, agreed.

201
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Okay.

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,480
So it's a way of reaching an agreement, like you say, where both sides have their goals

203
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,240
and they try to find a price that is the best for both parties.

204
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
That's right.

205
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,600
So it's basically a verb to negotiate and this is what you do, as you said, in many

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,560
circumstances, especially when you're getting a job.

207
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Yes.

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
All right.

209
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:38,920
So let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

210
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,800
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?

211
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Sure.

212
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,680
What are you looking to buy or sell?

213
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

214
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, you want to get a maid?

215
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.

216
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Okay.

217
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,360
So what do you want her to do?

218
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,840
Well, let's see.

219
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,880
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom,

220
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,560
and maybe do some cooking.

221
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Got it.

222
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
And how much do you offer per month?

223
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
I would pay her hourly.

224
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,720
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

225
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,040
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the

226
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,600
person that answers the ad.

227
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Great.

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,040
I'll be happy to help.

229
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
All right.

230
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,600
So talking about minimum wage, is there any exception to why a person would earn less

231
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,680
than minimum wage?

232
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,240
I don't believe so.

233
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Well, if they're not legally employed, right?

234
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,480
So if you're talking about people who we say are under the table, working under the table,

235
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,760
that means that they're not working legally.

236
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,400
They're not paying taxes.

237
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,280
Then maybe those people will be paid less.

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,120
What about waiters and waitresses?

239
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,760
I've heard that they earn less than minimum wage, but because they earn tips.

240
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
This is true.

241
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:58,440
So most restaurants say, okay, we will pay you as a waiter $3 an hour, but because you

242
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,240
will earn tips, you will earn more than the minimum wage.

243
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Right.

244
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,600
So this is a good exception.

245
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Unfortunately, there's no promise.

246
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,960
If you have no customers, you earn no tips, so you're still earning less than minimum

247
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
wage.

248
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
That's right.

249
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,760
But if you have many, many customers and you earn lots of tips and you make $15 an hour

250
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,360
or something much higher than the minimum wage.

251
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
That's right.

252
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,740
And actually being a waiter or a waitress is a very common job that a lot of people

253
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,080
have when they're still in school or over the summer.

254
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,440
And I've heard that it could be quite good because Americans are pretty good tippers.

255
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
That's right.

256
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,960
Americans generally tip between 15 and 20%.

257
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,080
And you know that you have to tip because your waiter does not earn a minimum wage.

258
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Right.

259
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,480
And so I think there is this expectation.

260
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,120
So if your bill comes out to like a hundred bucks, then you are most definitely going

261
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,560
to leave at least a $20 tip.

262
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
Usually, yeah, 15 to $20, $20 if it's that much money.

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Wow.

264
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Wow.

265
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,280
That's very, very interesting, especially considering that in many countries, tipping

266
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,920
is not really considered, it's not expected or it's not really something that people do.

267
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Exactly.

268
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
And in America, it is something that you have to do.

269
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,840
So I think a lot of times when people come to America, they don't expect to pay this.

270
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,480
There's tax, there's tip.

271
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,040
So when you see a menu, remember that the cost is a lot higher than you see.

272
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Exactly.

273
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
All right.

274
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
Very, very interesting topic.
