00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,080
My name is Catherine and today we have the beginning of a very long series on giving

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
a presentation.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,720
So this series is at the intermediate level, right Marco?

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
That's right.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,100
It's part of our business series.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,840
We previously took a look at how to go upon an interview.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,340
Now we're going to talk about presentation.

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,880
So everything about a presentation, how to give a presentation, language you can use

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
in a presentation and a lot of other things like this.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
That's right.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,600
We're going to talk about the very beginning of a presentation.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,360
Let's take a listen to this dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Hi everyone.

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,400
Can everyone hear me?

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,320
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,260
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,720
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for Alpha Computers.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,720
We have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,560
and desktop computers.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for Alpha Computers,

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,400
who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,480
and to answer any questions you may have.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,280
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Thank you, Jonathan.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,520
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,340
It has been three years since I visited Beijing and it's clear to me that operations here

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,120
are obviously going from strength to strength.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,080
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China and that is certainly

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,540
down to the hard work of all of you here.

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,480
So congratulations to all of you.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,780
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,920
you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,480
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,080
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,320
whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,200
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,480
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,960
Then I'd like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,600
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,080
me.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
All right, we're back.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,880
So as you can see, it's the very beginning of a presentation.

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,040
We're kind of starting to give people an idea what we're going to talk about.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,720
So let's take a look at some of the language Mr. Ford used on Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,600
Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,560
So the reason Mr. Ford is giving a presentation is because he wants to talk about the company's

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,280
new line of computers, right?

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,600
And so he says that they're going to launch a new line of desktop and laptop computers.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
That's right.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
So they want to launch a new line of laptops.

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,000
So this verb to launch means to bring out to the market.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,640
So instead of the word to start, which you could use in many different ways, like to

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,440
start eating or to start swimming.

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,880
In this case, to launch means you're going to introduce a new product to the market.

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Like you said, Marco.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
So we're going to start selling to the market a new product.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
We're going to launch a new line of laptop and desktop computers.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,160
For example, this spring, Steve Jobs launched the iPad, which is a new product.

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
That's right.

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,120
So he launched the iPad and the iPhone 4.

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,720
They're always launching new things at Apple.

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
That's right.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
All right.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,840
So since they're launching this new line of laptop and desktop computers, Mr. Ford first

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,720
wanted to give a brief overview of the marketing campaign.

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Okay.

71
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,640
So first of all, we're going to talk about how this product is being marketed.

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,920
So you want to give a general picture or a very simple picture of what's going to happen.

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,960
So at the beginning, this will happen.

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,320
Then this will happen at the end.

75
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
This will happen.

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
And that's what we call an overview.

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
That's right.

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,640
So it's a brief or general idea of what we're talking about.

79
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,360
An overview, nothing too specific.

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,320
We just want to give you a general idea.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,440
That's right.

82
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,120
After that, Mr. Ford starts talking and he's talking about the presentation, which has

83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,320
many parts, and he wants to talk about what each part will contain.

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,080
So he says, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line.

85
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,480
So this verb, to touch on.

86
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,760
What does this mean?

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Okay.

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,280
So when he says he wants to touch on the background of this new computer, he's basically saying,

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,680
I want to talk about.

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
All right.

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,560
So this is potentially very confusing because we know the word to touch means to put your

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
hand on something.

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,440
But to touch on, this is a phrasal verb, this means to talk about or to address.

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
That's right.

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,840
So for example, a teacher at a university will touch on many topics during his lecture.

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
That's right.

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Or I'd like to touch on where we're going to dinner tonight because I'm very hungry.

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Okay.

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,560
So basically it's a nice way of saying, I want to talk about this topic.

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,560
And then apart from touching on the background of the new computer, he said he also wants

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,880
to talk about projected sales for this new computer.

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Okay.

103
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,800
So projected sales, this phrase includes two words.

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Sales means how much of something you sell, obviously, but projected means what you expect

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,760
to sell.

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,960
So the projected sales have not happened yet.

107
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560
They will happen in the future.

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,680
And so they're basically my guess about sales.

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
That's right.

110
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,640
So basically we are giving an estimate of what we think we will sell.

111
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,120
Those are projected sales.

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
We think we will sell a thousand computers.

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,120
Those are our projected sales.

114
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Right.

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
And after that, we have one more key word.

116
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,640
This word comes at the very end of the speech.

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,600
Mr. Ford says, we will then go on to discuss our key rivals.

118
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Now who is a rival, Marco?

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Okay.

120
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,600
So a rival is basically your competitor or maybe kind of your enemy.

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
All right.

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
So in computers, who is Apple's rival?

123
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,720
Maybe HP or IBM or Dell.

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Very good.

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,800
So a rival is someone you compete with.

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
That's right.

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,880
So he's going to talk about his key rivals.

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,080
So basically the word key is your most important rivals.

129
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
All right.

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,980
So for example, who is one of Batman's key rivals?

131
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,160
Because we have rivals not just in business, but also in life.

132
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
That's right.

133
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,160
So I think maybe Batman's key rival might be the Joker.

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Or the Penguin.

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Or the Penguin.

136
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
All right.

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,960
So let's take another listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment with some very

138
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,240
important phrases.

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Hi, everyone.

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,320
Can everyone hear me?

141
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,200
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

142
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,160
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

143
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,640
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for Alpha Computers.

144
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,620
We have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop

145
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,480
and desktop computers.

146
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for Alpha Computers,

147
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,320
who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign

148
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,400
and to answer any questions you may have.

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,160
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford.

150
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,040
Thank you, Jonathan.

151
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,440
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

152
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,240
It has been three years since I visited Beijing and it's clear to me that operations here

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,040
are obviously going from strength to strength.

154
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,000
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China and that is certainly

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,440
down to the hard work of all of you here.

156
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,400
So congratulations to all of you.

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,680
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,840
you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

159
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,400
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

160
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,000
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,280
whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

162
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,120

163
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

164
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,880
Then I'd like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

165
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,920
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for

166
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,480
me.

167
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,080
All right, so we've prepared three phrases for you.

168
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,480
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,920
Fluency Builder.

170
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,760
So this first phrase is really important because it's about the part of the speech that happens

171
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,880
before the speech begins.

172
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,400
You know, usually you have a person who's going to talk about something, but you also

173
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,840
have someone who introduces that person.

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,640
You know, this is John.

175
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,240
He's going to talk about computers.

176
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
He's very smart.

177
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
Listen to everything he says.

178
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,760
So we usually hear the phrase, let's give a warm welcome to.

179
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes, this is a very nice way of presenting someone.

180
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,040
So obviously this person is talking to a group of people and he's introducing Mr. Ford.

181
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,820
So he says, let's give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford.

182
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,120
So that's saying let's clap.

183
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
Let's say hello to him.

184
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
That's right.

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,760
So like you said, this is an invitation to clap.

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,400
You have to clap when you hear this.

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,440
Warm welcome means let's be nice to him.

188
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,360
Let's all smile and encourage him.

189
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,920
You know, you think about it.

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,240
Someone who's going to give a speech is probably nervous.

191
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,880
And so this helps them feel comfortable.

192
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
That's right.

193
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,480
So it's a very nice way if you're maybe presenting someone who's going to talk, you can say,

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,720
let's give a warm welcome to whoever you're presenting.

195
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay.

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Now when Mr. Ford was talking, he mentioned this very interesting phrase about operations.

197
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,040
He said, it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to

198
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
strength.

199
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Okay.

200
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
So that means things are going well.

201
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,860
You do one thing, you do it well.

202
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,040
You move on to another thing, you do that well as well.

203
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Okay.

204
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,720
So that's what it means from strength to strength.

205
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,160
So we're saying that things are going from good to better.

206
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
That's right.

207
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
And getting better.

208
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Okay.

209
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
And what about our last phrase?

210
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Our last phrase is kind of similar to the last one.

211
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,880
The alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds.

212
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,080
All right.

213
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,480
So you can have a company that grows.

214
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
It grows a little.

215
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,240
You can have a company that grows quite a bit.

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Then you have a company that grows in leaps and bounds.

217
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,480
That means a lot.

218
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Okay.

219
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,340
So to leap is to jump, right?

220
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,340
That's right.

221
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
And so this is what we're saying.

222
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,840
We're just jumping higher and higher.

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,880
We're getting bigger and bigger or better and better.

224
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
That's right.

225
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
So this is an exaggeration.

226
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,000
It's like saying that it's not going quickly.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,240
It's going the speed of light.

228
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
You know, it's just so fast.

229
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
All of a sudden, just really growing.

230
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Okay.

231
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
A lot of interesting phrases there.

232
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,040
A lot of key vocab.

233
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,600
I think we can listen to this dialogue again.

234
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
And we'll be back in a bit.

235
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Hi, everyone.

236
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Can everyone hear me?

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:07,160
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

238
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,100
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

239
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,560
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for alpha computers.

240
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
We have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,400
and desktop computers.

242
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for alpha computers,

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,240
who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign

244
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,320
and to answer any questions you may have.

245
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,240
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford.

246
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,960
Thank you, Jonathan.

247
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,360
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

248
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,180
It has been three years since I visited Beijing and it's clear to me that operations here

249
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,000
are obviously going from strength to strength.

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,960
The alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China and that is certainly

251
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,420
down to the hard work of all of you here.

252
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,360
So congratulations to all of you.

253
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,640
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving

254
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,800
you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

255
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,360
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

256
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,960
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the

257
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,200
whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

258
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,080
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

259
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,360
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

260
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,840
Then I'd like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

261
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for

262
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
me.

263
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,120
Alright, so as we mentioned, this is the first part of a ten-part series all about public

264
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,440
speaking, giving a presentation.

265
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,080
We're going to talk about many aspects of a presentation like charts and graphs and

266
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,360
using PowerPoint, all these really modern ways of giving a presentation.

267
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,720
That's right and we're going to try and talk to you about some of the places in presentations

268
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
that English learners tend to struggle with.

269
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,980
You know, it's sometimes very hard to know what to say, especially like in today's lesson,

270
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,620
how do you introduce someone in a presentation?

271
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,400
It's not very common to learn how to say that.

272
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,600
So we hope that through these podcasts, you'll be able to learn some really important phrases

273
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,160
and become more comfortable while you're giving presentations in English.

274
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
That's right.

275
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,840
And of course, if you have any questions about these lessons or any of our lessons, you can

276
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,880
always find us at EnglishPod.com or you can send us also your suggestions about any lesson

277
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
topics you may have.

278
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
That's right.

279
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
So we hope to hear from you.

280
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,520
Please let us know what you're thinking and until next time everyone.

281
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Bye.

282
00:13:39,520 --> 00:14:00,340
Thank you.
