00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,160
My name is Catherine and today we have a new lesson in our series about interviewing for

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
a new job.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
This is of course at the elementary level.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
That's right.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,720
So this is part four of our interview series.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,600
Remember we are taking a look each week at giving you tips and also the proper language

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,960
for when you have an interview in English.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,560
And on this occasion we're going to talk about our work experience.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,040
Okay, you remember we talked a little bit about educational experience and educational

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
background.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
Well today is all about your last couple of jobs.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,560
Alright, so I think we should just listen to the dialogue for the first time and we'll

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:50,400
be back in a bit with language takeaway.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,600
Right Rebecca, now I see that after graduating from university your first job was...

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,920
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,120
Actually I started with them as an intern.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,320
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,840
first step.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,940
Certainly.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,880
And after your internship?

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,080
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,660
I ended up staying two years there actually.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,560
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,360
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,600
Yes I see, but you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Yes that's right.

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,560
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,440
newspaper based in London.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,920
The London Weekly, right?

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Yes.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,320
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,760
for the future.

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,200
Alright we're back so now we've picked out a couple of key words and we're going to take

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,200
a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,680
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,760
So Marco, a lot of people don't start out as a professional with a job.

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,960
They have something else first.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
What is this?

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
That's right.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,920
A very popular way to begin your work experience, you become an intern or you work as an intern.

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,120
Okay so the name of the job we could say is intern.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm an intern or he's an intern at my company.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Exactly.

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,000
So usually interns work at a company.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,920
Usually they're not paid or if they are it's a very, very little pay and the purpose of

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,960
an internship or to work as an intern is to gain experience.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
That's right.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,800
So it's basically like a study opportunity for a job that you know you want.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,040
I could be an intern at a media company and I could learn all about media but it's not

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,920
really a full job.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Exactly.

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,800
So it's really it serves as an opportunity to maybe continue working at that company

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,540
in a full time job.

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:58,940
So you become an intern and the noun or what you are doing is called an internship.

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,920
So I'm an intern but what I have is an internship.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,080
It's like saying I have a job.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,680
I have an internship but I am an intern.

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Exactly.

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
Alright so we've covered those two words.

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,920
Now let's move on to when she's describing her work experience in the York Herald and

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,200
she described it as a very good first step.

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,720
Okay so a first step you think about your foot, your step, your moving.

65
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,120
It means the very first thing you do when you're heading in some direction.

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,600
Right and professionally I guess your first steps are maybe becoming an intern.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Right or you could say my first step was working in the mail room at this big movie studio

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,520
but later I became a famous movie producer.

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,640
Exactly so that's kind of like the way that you begin your professional life.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,880
And well then they started talking about the newspapers and actually Rebecca was offered

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,400
a position as a junior local news reporter.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay so junior means usually lower ranking or not experienced.

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,160
Someone who is just starting out and of course after junior we have senior.

74
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,880
So a senior news reporter is someone who's worked for many many years as a reporter.

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,360
Usually I guess a junior news reporter would make less money than a senior news reporter.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Exactly you could also say junior executive or senior executive.

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
Junior manager.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,600
These are ways of describing length of experience.

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,560
And in this case she's junior but what kind of job does she have?

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,200
Well she is a news reporter for local issues.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,640
Okay so she's a local news reporter.

82
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,920
Now what exactly does that mean if you're a local news reporter or for local issues?

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Well if I live in Chicago and I'm a local news reporter I only write or report the news

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,520
about Chicago.

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,560
It's a way of describing the things in my area.

86
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,680
So it's the opposite of our next phrase national news reporter.

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,080
Okay so if you are a national news reporter or a national manager of maybe a company then

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,880
that means that you oversee things in the whole country.

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,160
That's right so local is my city or my county but in the case of national we're talking

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,800
about the whole country.

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
Nation national.

92
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
So national is an adjective.

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,880
But we could even go further than this.

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,000
What if I am a reporter and I talk about foreign countries?

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,280
I talk about France and South Africa and even Iceland.

96
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Then I guess you would be an international news reporter.

97
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Exactly.

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,680
And I guess also at the executive level you can have an international marketing manager

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
right?

100
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
That's right.

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,520
International marketing manager, national marketing manager.

102
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,480
These are very important ways to divide work to say he is the international manager, he

103
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
is the national manager.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,040
This tells you the kind of the size of this person's job.

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Exactly.

106
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,680
Okay so now more or less you know how these jobs can be divided junior, senior, national,

107
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,240
local, etc.

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,040
So I think we should go back to the dialogue.

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,400
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,560
Alright Rebecca, now I see that after graduating from university your first job was...

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,920
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

112
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Actually I started with them as an intern.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,320
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good

114
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
first step.

115
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
Certainly.

116
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,880
And after your internship?

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,080
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

118
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,640
I ended up staying two years there actually.

119
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,520
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

120
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

121
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,740
Yes I see.

122
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,600
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

123
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Yes that's right.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,560
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national

125
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,440
newspaper based in London.

126
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,960
The London Weekly, right?

127
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Yes.

128
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,320
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects

129
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,240
for the future.

130
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:27,760
Alright so now let's start with a couple of phrases and phrasal verbs on Fluency Builder.

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Fluency Builder.

132
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,140
Okay in today's dialogue we heard a lot of really wonderful phrases Marco.

133
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,680
Some of them are ways of making your experiences sound better, more professional even.

134
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,000
For example this first one, sorry Rebecca is talking about her first job in York and

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,240
she says I was in charge of the sports news section.

136
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,040
So that phrase, I was in charge of or to be in charge of, what does this describe?

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,120
This describes responsibility.

138
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,080
Basically she's saying I was responsible for or I had to manage the sports news section.

139
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,240
She's taking credit for this job that was important.

140
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,560
Okay so this is a key phrase because this is the typical phrase that you use to describe

141
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,040
your responsibilities or to describe what you did in your previous job position or your

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
previous job.

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,960
So I could ask you when you were in marketing, what were you in charge of?

144
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,280
Right and then you say well I was in charge of and then you explain your responsibilities

145
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
or what you did.

146
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,920
I was in charge of our national accounts or I was in charge of the local news.

147
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,400
Exactly so this is a very simple phrase, just remember it.

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,400
I was in charge of and then you can start explaining what were your responsibilities,

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,040
what you did in your previous job.

150
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,240
Alright moving on now towards the end of that paragraph, Rebecca says that well being in

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,960
charge of the sports news section was really fun and it really helped her build my skills.

152
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,040
It really helped me build my skills.

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,060
So to build your skills or in this case I build my skills means that I have some skills

154
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,320
but maybe they're not really developed.

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,120
Maybe I just finished college, I want more experience.

156
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,800
Well in that time during my first job I build my skills.

157
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,840
I become better at writing or having interviews, things like that.

158
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,040
Exactly so when you build your skills you kind of improve your abilities or you gain

159
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,400
more experience.

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Another interesting phrase coming up here when Rebecca talked about moving to London

161
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,520
with her husband she said I managed to find a position with a national newspaper.

162
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,280
Okay so I managed to or you could say to manage to do something.

163
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,680
This is a really interesting phrase because it's another way of saying to be able to

164
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,400
or to succeed at something.

165
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,620
Okay so don't confuse it with manager or to manage people.

166
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,760
That is also correct, obviously it exists but to manage to do something is to as you

167
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
said to be able to do something.

168
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,100
Right so for example I was running really late yesterday and I had a ticket for a train

169
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
at five o'clock.

170
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,280
I thought I would miss the train but I managed to get to the train on time.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,840
That means I was able to get on the train on time.

172
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,160
Obviously so you managed to find a job, I managed to get to the train on time, I was

173
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,040
able to.

174
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,980
Alright and towards the end Rebecca talked about her job at the London Weekly and she

175
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,680
described it as a step down from my previous job.

176
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay is this a good thing or a bad thing Marco?

177
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
To be a step down in something is a bad thing.

178
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
It's to reduce in level or to decrease.

179
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,520
Okay so basically she's saying listen I had this really great job in York and I took a

180
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:04,280
new job in London and the new job it wasn't as good in many ways because maybe she had

181
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,840
less responsibility or maybe it paid less.

182
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,800
So this is a way of saying it wasn't as good as my last job.

183
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,880
Okay so her new job was a step down from her previous job.

184
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,280
You could say I think his new girlfriend's a bit of a step down if you know what I mean.

185
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
So usually you're comparing right?

186
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,560
You're making a comparison between something from the past to now.

187
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Exactly.

188
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay so a step down.

189
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back to

190
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:43,240
talk to you in a bit.

191
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,440
Right Rebecca now I see that after graduating from university your first job was...

192
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,760
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

193
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,960
Actually I started with them as an intern.

194
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,160
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
first step.

196
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,760
Certainly.

197
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,720
And after your internship?

198
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,920
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

199
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,480
I ended up staying two years there actually.

200
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,360
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,200
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,480
Yes I see but you decided to leave them in 2006 right?

203
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Yes that's right.

204
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,400
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national

205
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,280
newspaper based in London.

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
The London Weekly right?

207
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Yes.

208
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,160
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,000
for the future.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Alright so talking about internships and interns it seems that usually it's not very exciting

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,840
to become an intern because it ends up that the office people just make you make coffee

212
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,640
or copies and stuff like that.

213
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
You're not really gaining much work experience.

214
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,000
That is the reputation in the United States for internships.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,920
So basically when you agree to do an internship, sometimes you have to apply to do an internship.

216
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,040
It's a very long process.

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,120
You end up like you say making coffee for people or photocopying reports and this is

218
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,680
really boring work.

219
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Right.

220
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,080
I think that is the reputation that many places have like you say in the United States but

221
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,600
also I don't know I guess it does seem in a way the only opportunity in order to be

222
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
able to get into an industry or a company.

223
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,400
Maybe it's a really good company like I don't know like Procter and Gamble.

224
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,080
And how else are you going to be able to get in there with no job experience?

225
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,760
Well that's right and a lot of people know that an internship doesn't really give you

226
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,360
work experience but they still think that it gives you some edge or some advantage when

227
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,400
you're looking for jobs later because if I write down on my resume, we were talking earlier

228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,120
about resumes, if I write down on my resume that I was an intern at Procter and Gamble,

229
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,640
wow that's really impressive.

230
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,600
Right, it looks good.

231
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,680
Alright so this is an interesting topic.

232
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,000
Let us know if you were ever an intern.

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,400
Maybe you started out as an internship or maybe you're doing one now.

234
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Was it better than we say?

235
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,760
Did you do anything else other than making coffee?

236
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,280
We really hope so and we look forward to hearing about your experiences.

237
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,720
Alright we'll see everyone at EnglishPod.com and until next time.

238
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
