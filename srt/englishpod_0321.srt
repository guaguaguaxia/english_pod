00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,300
My name is Kathryn and we've been traveling around the world eating different foods from

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,880
different countries and today we're in Thailand.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
That's right.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,700
Thai food is one of the most popular types of food around the world especially because

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,360
of that specific Asian taste it has.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,200
And so we're going to jump right into this dialogue today and see what we have prepared

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,960
for you today.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
What did you cook?

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,880
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,680
So I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Great idea.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
As long as I don't get food poisoning.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,720
So what is on the menu tonight?

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,920
Okay, for starters we have Tom Yum soup.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,480
It's a bit spicy but really good.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,760
This is delicious.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,040
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,720
Now this next dish is one of the most famous.

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,600
Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,280
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,600
and tomato.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,880
This is delicious.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,220
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

26
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,000
I could have this every day.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,100
Okay, now for the last and best dish in my opinion.

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,040
This is called Pad Thai.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,400
Stir fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper plus bean

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,000
sprouts, shrimp and tofu garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,280
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,800
Wow, this is great.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,960
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Want some more?

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
I'm stuffed.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,160
All right, so we've got a number of different dishes we'd like to talk about as well as

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
phrases.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,680
So let's look at some of those dishes and important key words in language takeaway.

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Language takeaway.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,720
All right, so the first word we have on language takeaway today is food poisoning.

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,240
So we don't want to get food poisoning when having this, any meal.

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
Any meal, no, that's right.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
Food poisoning is a bad thing.

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,760
Now this is something that happens when you eat bad food or dirty food.

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,240
So you get very, very sick and you feel like you have to vomit, you have to throw up.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
That's right.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,480
So your stomach hurts, you feel like you have to throw up, you may be going to the bathroom

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,960
very often.

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,720
That means usually you have food poisoning.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
All right, and so people often associate food poisoning with food that you eat on the street,

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
maybe dirtier food.

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,560
But this is something you should be very careful of when you're traveling, not to Thailand

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
alone, but maybe to any other country.

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
You can get it in America, you can get it in Mexico.

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
So just something to be careful of.

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
That's right.

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,640
So apart from that, we're going to jump into our first dish for today.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,320
We're having a soup called Tom Yum Soup.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Tom Yum Soup.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
Now this is one of my favorite soups.

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,680
It's quite spicy, isn't it, Marco?

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,440
Very spicy, but very, very good as well.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,640
It has a kind of citric taste, like a lemon.

64
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,600
It does, and it's very yellow or orange colored.

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,380
And it's a very, very common dish on Thai restaurant menus.

66
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,640
And there are some key ingredients in this soup that I think are important to discuss.

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,480
They're often found in Thai food and other kinds of Asian food.

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
The first one is ginger.

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,180
Ginger, that's right.

70
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,320
This is a root.

71
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,980
It kind of looks like a potato almost.

72
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,980
It does.

73
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,080
It's usually white and it has little arms, you know.

74
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,440
It's not a round object.

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
It's got pointy little arms.

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
That's right.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,240
And the characteristic taste of ginger is kind of strong and bitter.

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
It is quite strong.

79
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,720
You'll find it in Japanese food.

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Sometimes you get pickled ginger to eat.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,440
It's like a pink food you get with sushi.

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,160
Other times in Chinese cooking, it's something that's chopped up with garlic and cooked in

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
oil.

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,000
So ginger is a very important one.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
So in this soup, we have ginger and we also have lemongrass.

87
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,220
So this is very interesting because it's not very easily found around the world.

88
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,220
That's right.

89
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,520
This is very common in Southeast Asian cooking.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,520
And you might have a hard time finding it in places like America where it's not really

91
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,860
a part of the cuisine.

92
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,960
But lemongrass is very distinct.

93
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,860
It has a very strong flavor and it's actually quite long.

94
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,960
It's green and long.

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
It looks a bit like celery, but it's harder.

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
That's right.

97
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
That's right.

98
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
And the taste that it gives it is a little bit citric, kind of like a lemon almost.

99
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
That's right.

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,740
But you're going to find this in soups like tom yum or other things.

101
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,720
So lemongrass is another one.

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,880
And then moving on to our next dish, which is one of the most, I think, the most popular

103
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,880
dishes of all Thailand is the famous pad thai.

104
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Pad thai.

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,240
Now, this is absolutely my favorite Thai dish.

106
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
And I know that's very cliche.

107
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
It's something that everyone says, but it's true.

108
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,560
You know, this is a great dish you can buy on the street.

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,180
You can buy it in a restaurant.

110
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,080
It's basically a noodle dish, right?

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
That's right.

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,600
It's stir fried noodles with eggs and peanuts are the most, like the key ingredients in

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
there.

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
That's right.

115
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,140
But you might also get a little bit of hot red pepper, some sugar, some lime.

116
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,640
And the noodles are flat.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,760
They're not round.

118
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
That's right.

119
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,640
And actually one of the key ingredients also that gives it this very distinct taste is

120
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,960
tamarind juice.

121
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
All right.

122
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Tamarind juice.

123
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,060
This is again another one of those flavors from Southeast Asia that you might not find

124
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,640
in many other places, certainly not in America.

125
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,840
Now tamarind, they're funny looking things.

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
They look like peas, but they're dark brown.

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
That's right.

128
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,840
So tamarind juice gives it this kind of sweet flavor.

129
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,160
So this is the interesting thing about pad thai is that you have these sweet flavors

130
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,920
from the tamarind juice, from even the fish sauce combined with chili.

131
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,080
So it's kind of like a spicy, very sweet taste.

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
And then you have citrus.

133
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,000
You have some lime maybe and some sugar.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,360
So it's a lot of different tastes and flavors, but it's a really magical combination.

135
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
That's right.

136
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,040
So that's all we have for language takeaway.

137
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,000
Why don't we take another listen to our dialogue?

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What did you cook?

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

140
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,740
So I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Great idea.

142
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,880
As long as I don't get food poisoning.

143
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,800
So what is on the menu tonight?

144
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Okay.

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000
For starters, we have Tom Yum soup.

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,540
It's a bit spicy, but really good.

147
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,800
This is delicious.

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,720
Now this next dish is one of the most famous.

150
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,560
Foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is Tom Sam.

151
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,220
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded unripened papaya

152
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,560
and tomato.

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
This is delicious.

154
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,160
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

155
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,960
I could have this every day.

156
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Okay.

157
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,060
Now for the last and best dish, in my opinion.

158
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,000
This is called Pad Thai.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Stir fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,640
sprouts, shrimp, and tofu.

161
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,960
Garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,240
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

163
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Wow.

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
This is great.

165
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,920
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

166
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Want some more?

167
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm stuffed.

168
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
All right.

169
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
We're back.

170
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:34,280
So now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

171
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Fluency Builder.

172
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
So first up we have the phrase on the menu.

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
What's on the menu tonight?

174
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
That's right.

175
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,080
That person asked, so what's on the menu?

176
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,920
And by saying this, we're saying, well, what are we having for dinner?

177
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,040
What are we going to eat?

178
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
That's right.

179
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,800
So you might want to think, okay, menu, I'm going to look at the menu, but you could even

180
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
say this at home where there is no menu.

181
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,200
This is a spoken language way of saying, what are we eating tonight?

182
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Right.

183
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
That's right.

184
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
What's for dinner?

185
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
What are we eating?

186
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
What's on the menu?

187
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,520
Even though, as you said, there's no menu.

188
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
That's right.

189
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,760
And after that, we have another phrase that's really important.

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,720
We say, for starters, we're going to have this or that.

191
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,240
So for starters.

192
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
That's right.

193
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,060
We said for starters, we are having a soup, a Tom Yum soup.

194
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,880
So a starter dish is something that you have to begin the meal, a small dish maybe.

195
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
That's right.

196
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Start, starter.

197
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,480
So a starter is a noun, it's a thing, and it's something you eat at the beginning.

198
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
Usually it's not very heavy.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,880
A steak would never be a starter, right?

200
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Right.

201
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
All right.

202
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,240
So here we have Tom Yum soup, which is our starter.

203
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
And after that, we have the national dish.

204
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
Now this is a great phrase.

205
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Right.

206
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,480
We had the Pad Thai, which is considered to be the national dish.

207
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:51,360
And so usually every country has their national dish, something that's unique or that a country

208
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,840
is famous for.

209
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,440
Like, for example, China would be famous for?

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Kung Pao chicken.

211
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Kung Pao chicken, yeah.

212
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,360
In America, you might even say that apple pie is the most important national dish.

213
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,520
But do you guys have one in Ecuador?

214
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,680
What's your national dish?

215
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,920
I would say, I have no idea which would be.

216
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
It's not very well known.

217
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
Maybe ceviche is kind of shared between Peru and Ecuador.

218
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,280
Like maybe in Argentina, you would say steak is a national dish.

219
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Yeah, absolutely.

220
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,600
Or in Mexico, you know, like tacos or enchiladas, stuff like that.

221
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Or in Italy, spaghetti bolognese.

222
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
That's right.

223
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
All right.

224
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,760
So we have a number of different countries and each country maybe has one or two national

225
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
dishes.

226
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,640
These are very special dishes that are important for that country.

227
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
That's right.

228
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,360
So we have our national dishes.

229
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,680
And after we finish dinner, we ate so much that we say, I'm stuffed.

230
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm stuffed.

231
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,600
Now this is a common phrase that you will hear at the end of a meal when you've eaten

232
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,120
and eaten and eaten.

233
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,440
And it just means I'm full.

234
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm full.

235
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
I can't eat anymore.

236
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Yeah, I'm stuffed.

237
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,680
So stuffed means that I'm full of things.

238
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,640
Now it's a very informal way of saying I'm full, right?

239
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,400
Because if somebody says, would you like some more soup?

240
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
You say, no, thank you.

241
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm full.

242
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Right.

243
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,560
But if you're with friends, you can say, oh, I just had so much pizza.

244
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm stuffed.

245
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
That's right.

246
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,720
So it's a little bit more informal, but a lot more native-like.

247
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
That's right.

248
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
All right.

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,280
So let's take a listen to our dialogue one last time.

250
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
What did you cook?

251
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,180
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

252
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,000
So I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Great idea.

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,160
As long as I don't get food poisoning.

255
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,080
So what is on the menu tonight?

256
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,260
OK, for starters, we have Tom Yum soup.

257
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,800
It's a bit spicy, but really good.

258
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,080
This is delicious.

259
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,200
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

260
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,960
Now, this next dish is one of the most famous.

261
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is Tom Sam.

262
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,640
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded unripened

263
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,840
papaya and tomato.

264
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,120
This is delicious.

265
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,440
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,280
I could have this every day.

267
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,360
OK, now for the last and best dish, in my opinion.

268
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,280
This is called Pad Thai.

269
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:26,720
It's stir fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean

270
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,280
sprouts, shrimp and tofu, garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

271
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,560
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

272
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,040
Wow, this is great.

273
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,240
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

274
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Want some more?

275
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm stuffed.

276
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:49,320
All right, so speaking of Thai food, it's very famous around the world, but it's very

277
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
spicy.

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,280
It can be very spicy, and what always surprises me about Thai food is that the salads might

279
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,360
be the spiciest things on the menu.

280
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,400
People like to eat many different salads.

281
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,480
You have a Chiang Mai chicken salad or you have a papaya salad, but these are really,

282
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
really spicy.

283
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Yeah, that's right.

284
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,240
We have a line in our dialogue that we're eating papaya salad, and it's very interesting

285
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,080
because it has this fruit, papaya, and it has some other vegetables as well, but the

286
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
salad is very, very spicy itself.

287
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,720
That's right, and you would never think of a fruit salad as being something that's spicy

288
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
in America.

289
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,360
You'd think of it as being pretty tame, pretty boring.

290
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,640
But that's what gives it a certain attraction to it, right?

291
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,760
Absolutely, and I don't know if you're a big fan of Thai food.

292
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,640
I certainly am, and I really like that about Thai food, that you can have these really

293
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,320
spicy dishes, but there's just so much flavor.

294
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,320
There's so many things happening, lemongrass, sugar, lime, fish sauce.

295
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,040
Yeah, it's very, very good.

296
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,480
And speaking of national dishes, this is actually a very interesting question because as we

297
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,520
mentioned, a couple of countries have national dishes like Italy and different places, but

298
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,880
what about in your country?

299
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,940
Do you have a national dish or what would you consider to be your national dish?

300
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
That's right.

301
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,080
So we'd love to hear from you guys.

302
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
What's your national dish?

303
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,680
Tell us all about it, what it tastes like, and even if there's some history, tell us

304
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,840
about that too.

305
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

306
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
All right, we'll see you guys there.

307
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Bye.

308
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:35,500
Bye, everybody, muah.
