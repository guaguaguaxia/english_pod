00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,960
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,040
My name is Kathryn and today Marco we're talking about money.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
That's right.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,920
We're going to take a look at another lesson about money but this time we're going to learn

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,520
a little bit more about coins in the United States.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
That's right.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,680
Different coins, so different sizes and shapes, they have different names because they represent

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,320
different amounts of money.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,480
So today we're going to learn the names of those coins and we're also going to learn

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,080
a little bit about British money.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,880
So let's check out the dialogue.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,720
Help me organize these coins.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
That's a lot of money.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,440
What'd you do, break the piggy bank?

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,200
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills but first I have to separate

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,720
them into little piles.

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Okay.

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,120
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Great.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,440
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,400
I found some coins that are not from here.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,560
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,360
I have like 90 pence but in all it won't add up to one pound.

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,720
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Hopefully.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,880
All right, we're back so let's take a look at some of this language on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,040
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,320
So first up, Marco, we have this funny phrase, break the piggy bank.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
What is a piggy bank?

32
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,080
That's right, a piggy bank.

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,840
Now you may have seen this, it has the shape of a little pig.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,280
It's usually made out of plastic or ceramic and it has a little hole at the top where

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,600
you can put in coins and just basically save your money there.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,320
All right, so this is a pig-shaped bank but it's a bank you keep in your room.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,200
Mostly children have these, right?

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,880
Yeah, so if you want to save your change or you want to save some of your coins that you

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,600
have or teach your children about saving money, then usually they have a little piggy bank

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,820
where they can store their money.

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,000
So when you break the piggy bank, usually these were made of ceramic.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,720
So to spend the money, you have to decide when it's very, very special or important.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,000
So you have to break the entire bank and that's when you take all the coins you've been saving.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Right, exactly, because they didn't really have a little hole where you could take it

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
out from.

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,640
So when you wanted to take your money out, you literally had to break it.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Break it, all right.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,260
So that's the piggy bank.

49
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,220
But what do we store inside a piggy bank?

50
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,720
We don't store bills, do we?

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,320
That's right, no, we store coins.

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,720
So this is an interesting word, bill, you know, like the name Bill, Bill Clinton, for

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,100
example.

54
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,280
Bills are the paper money that we use.

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,680
All right, but not capitalized like a name because this is a normal, a common noun.

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Bills represent all paper money.

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
So I could get, I could ask for change.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,960
Could I have the change in bills, please?

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
That's right.

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,600
And if I'm at a store, they'll give me bills, maybe a $5 bill, $10 bill.

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,520
This also counts for other currencies.

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,560
So if I'm in China, I might get my renminbi, my yuan in bills.

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
So it's just a general name for paper money.

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
That's right.

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,880
So, but what we store in the piggy bank are coins.

66
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Now talking specifically about the types of coins or the different amounts that these

67
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,480
represent, let's take a look at those more in detail.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,000
All right, so first up we've got quarters.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Now this should be pretty easy if you know your time because a quarter is one-fourth

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
of something.

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,400
So if we're talking about money, it's a quarter of a dollar or 25 cents.

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
That's right.

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,880
So 25 cents or a quarter of a dollar or one-fourth of a dollar, we just call it a quarter.

74
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,200
So you know, most machines or pay phones, you need to insert quarters.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
That's right.

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,320
So we recognize the quarter because it's the biggest coin and it has a big eagle on one

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,200
side and on the other side it has George Washington's head.

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,840
George Washington, that's right.

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,640
Now the next in line or the next coin that we're going to take a look at are dimes.

80
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Dimes.

81
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,520
Now these are also recognizable because they're the smallest coins, but that does not mean

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,680
they're the smallest amount.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Dimes are actually the second largest.

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
They're 10 cents.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,960
They're 10 cents or one-tenth of a dollar.

86
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,280
And so you can say they're 10 cents or you can say dime.

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,800
So do you have, I don't know, if you have 10 dimes, that means you've got a dollar.

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
That's right.

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,160
10 dimes equal one dollar.

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,960
And the face on the dime is Thomas Jefferson.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Alexander Hamilton.

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I don't know.

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,200
No, he was the first, well, he created basically the Department of the Treasury.

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
But Thomas Jefferson is on another coin and that's what we're going to look at next.

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
That's right.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
The nickel.

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,080
The nickel is like the metal, you know, nickel.

98
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,440
And yeah, so this one is a little bit bigger than the dime, but not as big as the quarter.

99
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,280
I think it's a little bit thicker maybe.

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,480
It is thicker, but it's not as much money.

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,440
A nickel is five cents.

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Five cents.

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
So one-twentieth of a dollar.

104
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
That's right.

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
One-twentieth of a dollar.

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
So this is what we call a nickel.

107
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,240
So you would call this coin, you would say, hey, do you have any nickels?

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
Dimes and nickels usually go together.

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't know why.

110
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Nickels and dimes.

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Nickels and dimes.

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
Nickels and dimes means he doesn't have very much money.

113
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
That's right.

114
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,400
So, yeah, and then on this coin you have the face of Thomas Jefferson.

115
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
That's right.

116
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Okay.

117
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
And finally we have the only coin that's not silver colored.

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,640
It's actually more of a copper color.

119
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,200
That would be the penny.

120
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
The penny.

121
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
That's right.

122
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,240
One cent or one penny is the smallest of the coins.

123
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,340
And actually you need 100 of these to make one dollar.

124
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
That's right.

125
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,840
And it's very unique because it's a different color.

126
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,880
It's the smallest amount.

127
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,280
And the face on this coin, do you know this one?

128
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Yes.

129
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,480
This one is Abraham Lincoln.

130
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Correct.

131
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
All right.

132
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
So we've got all these important people.

133
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,760
All of them were presidents actually except for Alexander Hamilton.

134
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
That's right.

135
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,880
And actually I think Alexander Hamilton looks good.

136
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Better than the rest.

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
I don't know why.

138
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
He was a pretty handsome man.

139
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,960
Actually, no, he was said to be very funny looking I think.

140
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:12,080
So actually all of these coins, you can call them by these names and everyone will recognize

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,480
them, especially in the US.

142
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Now I don't really think they apply to any other country as we saw later on, for example,

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,920
money in England or the United Kingdom.

144
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,220
But usually in the US, if you say, hey, do you have any spare change or do you have any

145
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
nickels and dimes?

146
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,840
Or can I borrow a penny?

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,720
Can I borrow a penny?

148
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Usually in the US, they have these little things called take a penny, leave a penny,

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
right?

150
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Or give a penny, take a penny.

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,800
You see these because pennies are not worth very much money.

152
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,200
And oftentimes people will leave a penny and if you have, it may something costs 26 cents,

153
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,280
but you only have a quarter, you can take a penny and then spend that.

154
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,520
So they're basically free pennies you might see in a store.

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,680
And then also if you get change, maybe you don't want to carry those pennies around or

156
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
that change.

157
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
You just leave that there.

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,760
And then it's kind of a way of recycling this small amount of money, which is very interesting.

159
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,600
It is very interesting.

160
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,560
But we're going to actually take a look at some British currency.

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,280
So let's take another listen to the dialogue.

162
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,200
And when we come back, we'll explore that.

163
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Help me organize these coins.

164
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
That's a lot of money.

165
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
What'd you do?

166
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Break the piggy bank?

167
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,320
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills.

168
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,880
But first I have to separate them into little piles.

169
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Okay.

170
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,400
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

171
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Great.

172
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,480
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,760
I found some coins that are not from here.

174
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,880
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

175
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,680
I have like 90 pence, but it won't add up to one pound.

176
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

177
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Hopefully.

178
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,280
All right, we're back.

179
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,640
So let's take a look at these British words on Language Takeaway Part 2.

180
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,040
So here we've got British currency, the pound, right, is the name of the currency.

181
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
So in America we have the dollar.

182
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,080
In Britain we have the pound.

183
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
Is it the sterling pound?

184
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Yeah, pound sterling.

185
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
The pound sterling.

186
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Pound sterling.

187
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,080
And I think that has to do with weight, I'm sure.

188
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,360
But here we've got it divided into small and large quantities.

189
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
So where we have coins, we might have pence.

190
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Sounds like cents.

191
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Right, exactly.

192
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:32,240
And I think actually the penny might come from the British term pence.

193
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm sure it does.

194
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,600
They're very similar and the meaning is basically one hundredth of a pound.

195
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,680
Right, exactly.

196
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,640
And a pound is basically what you would say in the US, a dollar.

197
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,400
A pound is the currency of England.

198
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,960
But actually, you know how in the United States people would say, you know, a hundred bucks,

199
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,240
which would be a hundred dollars.

200
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,960
Over there they say one hundred quid.

201
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Quid.

202
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,760
So yeah, this is actually important slang.

203
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,440
In America I would spend five bucks at the movies.

204
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,720
In Britain I would spend five quid.

205
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
And now that's a slang term for one pound.

206
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
That's right.

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,120
And actually I've heard also like 50p, which I think means 50 cents.

208
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Yeah, pence.

209
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Pence.

210
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Yeah, so 50p.

211
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,040
So you could say this stick of, or this pack of gum costs 50p.

212
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,440
So 50 pence.

213
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
That's right.

214
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Half of a pound.

215
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,040
So currency, obviously the currencies are different, but also it is interesting to learn

216
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
the way that you would say it locally.

217
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,000
So you know, next time if you are in Britain or you're talking to an English person, then

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,040
you'd know if they say, you know, 50 quid, you understand they're talking about 50 pounds.

219
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Exactly.

220
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
So, but they don't use the euro over there.

221
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
No, they don't.

222
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Not in Great Britain.

223
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,760
They do use the euro on the continents of France, Italy.

224
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,520
And the euro is the name of that currency.

225
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Okay.

226
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
All right.

227
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
So that's good stuff.

228
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,240
And now lastly, although we saw it at the beginning of the dialogue, let's talk about

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
what this person wants to do.

230
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,160
He wants to change these coins into bills.

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
That's right.

232
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,080
So the verb when you need to exchange money is to change money.

233
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,000
So let's say if I go to England and all I have is dollars, I would say I want to change

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
money.

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay.

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,560
You could also say exchange, but when we're speaking to one another, we normally just

237
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
say change.

238
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Right.

239
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Right.

240
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,120
Because even the places are sometimes called like money changers.

241
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,840
You know, they say that or something like that.

242
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Exactly.

243
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,000
And so if I want to change money, that means I want to maybe change dollars for euros or

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,680
dollars for pounds.

245
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,640
But this also can mean I want to change a dollar for some quarters.

246
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Right.

247
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Right.

248
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,160
Because I need quarters for like a laundry machine or a telephone.

249
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Right.

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
And I've heard also the term is to break.

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,800
So if maybe you have a $10 bill and you need maybe a $5 bill, but you don't have like,

252
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,680
you ask the person to break that money.

253
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,720
So you say, can you break this bill?

254
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Yeah.

255
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,760
And that actually makes sense because a bill normally you break something that's big into

256
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
smaller pieces.

257
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,560
So if you think about it, if I break a glass, it becomes many pieces.

258
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,600
Well, if I break a $5 bill, I want maybe $1.

259
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,840
I get five of those.

260
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,660
There's one piece and then it breaks into many pieces.

261
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,360
So to break means to ask for smaller change.

262
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
That's right.

263
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
So maybe next time you guys need change, you can go up to someone and say, excuse me, can

264
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,560
you change this $5 bill for me?

265
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,080
Or can you break this $5 bill for me?

266
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
That's right.

267
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
All right.

268
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,520
So a lot of interesting language, very useful stuff.

269
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,960
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

270
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,640
Help me organize these coins.

271
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
That's a lot of money.

272
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
What'd you do?

273
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Break the piggy bank?

274
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,920
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills.

275
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,640
But first I have to separate them into little piles.

276
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Okay.

277
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,040
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

278
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Great.

279
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

280
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,320
I found some coins that are not from here.

281
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Oh yeah.

282
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Those are from my trip to London.

283
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,280
I have like 90 pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.

284
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

285
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Hopefully.

286
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,800
All right.

287
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,920
Coming back to the topic now, you seem to know a lot about this stuff.

288
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,320
Let's test your knowledge here.

289
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,560
On the $100 bill, who do we find?

290
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,000
What president or one person?

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Benjamin Franklin.

292
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

293
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,320
But he wasn't a president, right?

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
He was not.

295
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,160
He was a very important figure in American history.

296
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Many people are familiar with the story of Benjamin Franklin and the kite with the key

297
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
on it.

298
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
So he discovered electricity.

299
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
That's right.

300
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,880
He was a very important inventor and also an important person when it comes to the creation

301
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
of America.

302
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
That's right.

303
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,800
Now, the smaller of the bills would be the $1 bill.

304
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,160
And actually now you have a $1 coin as well.

305
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
But on the $1 bill, do you know who's on there?

306
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,360
I think it's George Washington also, right?

307
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I think so, yeah.

308
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,760
So he's on the quarter and on the $1 bill.

309
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,520
We like to recycle our presidents.

310
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,440
The $20 bill then would be Abraham Lincoln, right?

311
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Oh, that's right.

312
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
So they're actually on...

313
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,440
That's kind of unfair though.

314
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,840
These are favorite presidents in the United States.

315
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,640
But they haven't changed over time.

316
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,360
In other countries, you see that they change according to the important person that's in

317
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,240
government or maybe, for example, in China, you have Chairman Mao on there, which before

318
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
you didn't.

319
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,480
Or in England, you have Queen Elizabeth, before was the previous ruler, which I think was

320
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,160
King George VI.

321
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,560
But in the US, guys flat out 100 years ago, these guys haven't changed them since then.

322
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,080
Well, I think what America likes to celebrate its creation.

323
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
And so...

324
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Which is still a very young country, right?

325
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Right.

326
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
1776, so it's only been, what, 240 years.

327
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,760
So yeah, the idea is basically that we celebrate the founding, so the beginning of the republic.

328
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,880
And the men who are involved in that, they're called the founders.

329
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:56,680
George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, all of them, Benjamin Franklin,

330
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
these people are very important in the history of America.

331
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,560
And that's why we celebrate them on our money.

332
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,000
The one exception, of course, is Abraham Lincoln.

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He was from the 1860s.

334
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Right, 16th president.

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's right.

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,040
And he was very important because of the Civil War, and a lot of the changes that later happened

337
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,120
to our constitution.

338
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,760
And so he's another person who's maybe added on.

339
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,880
So he's basically the last guy you guys kind of celebrate, because you don't have, I don't

340
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
know...

341
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

342
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,040
Right, or Bill Clinton, or something like this.

343
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Not yet.

344
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,120
Right, so I guess we got to wait a while.

345
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,440
But that's very interesting.

346
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,880
This history aspect of currencies is actually very, very interesting.

347
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
It is.

348
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,960
And one thing I'd like to add about quarters is that in the 2000s, so from 2000, I think,

349
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,000
on, the United States started to make state quarters.

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,680
So you'll see oftentimes these quarters with a picture of a state, New Hampshire, Maryland,

351
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,840
Illinois, California, and a special symbol of that state.

352
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,240
And so these are special quarters from the last maybe 10 years or so.

353
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah, I remember seeing these because usually on the other side of the quarter, on one side

354
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,320
you had George Washington, on the other side you had the eagle, the emblem of the flag,

355
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
I guess.

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Well, not the flag, but the national bird or the republic.

357
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,000
But now you have these states, and it says Delaware, and it has a little maybe, I don't

358
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,360
know, flower or something that's representative of these states.

359
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,480
So that was actually very nice.

360
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,440
It was a collector's type thing as well, right?

361
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
People were collecting these.

362
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
That's right.

363
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
You can collect all 50.

364
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Some people did that.

365
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,120
And you still see them in use.

366
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,360
So those are the state quarters.

367
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
And those generally are newer quarters.

368
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Okay, interesting.

369
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
All right, guys.

370
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,240
