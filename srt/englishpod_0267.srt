00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson about going to the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
bank.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
That's right.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,240
Today we're going to go to the bank and we need to do something there.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,240
We're not going to put money in the bank actually.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,800
We're going to make a transfer.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,960
Okay, so you'll learn all about this in a minute.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:28,160
Let's take a listen to the dialogue first.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
Good morning.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,080
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
How may I help you today?

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,280
Hi, I need to transfer some money to another account.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
It's urgent.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Okay.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,500
No, I've never made a transfer before.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
It's all right.

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,120
I will take you through the procedure.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,920
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
A company account.

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
I need to pay a bill.

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Okay.

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,040
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank's

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,080
address and phone number.

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,680
I have all the information in this folder.

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,840
Well, you've come prepared.

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
It's a simple transaction and we can process it today.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,840
Oh, that's such a relief.

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,260
Thank you so much.

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,260
It's my pleasure.

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,960
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
So interesting dialogue, very common situation.

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,480
We need to transfer money to another account.

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,760
So we have some very interesting vocab words right there.

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,640
Why don't we take a look at those on Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,880
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,360
So Marco, the first word is one that you've already said a couple of times in today's

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
lesson.

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
It is to transfer.

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay, that's right.

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,100
We need to transfer money.

46
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,740
So to transfer, what does this verb mean?

47
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,040
So to transfer means to move from one place to another.

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,960
In the case of money, you're moving money from one bank to another bank or from one

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,520
account to another account.

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
So just think of transferring as moving.

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
That's right.

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,880
But the bank teller also mentioned something about a wire transfer.

53
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
So that's basically the same thing, right?

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040
So when you're talking about money, you don't actually take a bag of money and you don't

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,600
walk to another bank to put it in the account.

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,760
A wire transfer means that the transfer is electronic.

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,820
One bank tells another bank that you're going to exchange this money.

59
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,000
So it's going to move from one person to another person or from one company to another company.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
But it's never actually the money itself.

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,720
It's always just the number of funds in the account.

62
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
That's right.

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,100
Okay, so a wire transfer, to transfer money electronically from one account to another.

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,280
And talking about this word account, we're talking about a bank account.

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
What is this?

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Well, this is really important even if you're not making a wire transfer or if you're not

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,520
working at a bank.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,200
This is something that most people have for their personal use.

69
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,100
So an account is a space for money in a bank that's kind of registered to one person or

70
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,280
one company.

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,920
And there are many, many different kinds of accounts.

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
That's right.

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,880
Many of you probably have a savings account.

74
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,240
This is where you keep your money to save for the future.

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,840
Or many companies or people have a checking account or a default account where basically

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,560
you put money in, but you're also taking money out and paying for bills and paying to go

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,880
to the movies, etc.

78
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah, so these different accounts have different rules.

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,440
They have rules about how much money you can keep in them or how much money you need to

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,600
open them.

81
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
So the basic word here is account.

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,440
And just remember that companies and people can all have accounts at a bank.

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
That's right.

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Okay, so when talking about an account, we're talking about transferring money to another

85
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
account.

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,920
We don't say we want to transfer money.

87
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,200
We say we want to transfer funds.

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
Funds.

89
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,240
So funds, we usually say in the plural, funds, with an S. This means money.

90
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,720
So we're talking about transferring funds from one company to another or I could say

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,040
I need to deposit funds in my account.

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
That's right.

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Now an interesting word because funds with an S at the end, that's a plural noun as you

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,740
said, but if we use it in the singular, it could also be a verb, to fund.

95
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
That's right.

96
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,800
And that means to pay for something or someone.

97
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,680
So my grandfather funded my college education.

98
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
He paid money for my college education.

99
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
That's right.

100
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,520
So both words, either the verb or the noun, have to do with money.

101
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,400
And when we're talking about transferring money, we're talking about a type of transaction,

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
right?

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Where a bank transfer or a wire transfer is a type of transaction.

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
That's right.

105
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,840
So a transaction is a noun and it's something that you do at a bank, for example, usually

106
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,940
involving the exchange of money.

107
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,180
So a wire transfer is a kind of transaction, but also depositing or putting money into

108
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,800
my savings account is also a kind of transaction.

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
That's right.

110
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,920
So a transaction is kind of like a business move or a business deal involving money.

111
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,880
For example, a transaction can also be buying a car.

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
That's right.

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,800
So the transaction is I give my money to Marco, the car salesperson, and the transaction is

114
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
exchanging that money for the car.

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
That's right.

116
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Okay.

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,600
And lastly, since we needed to pay a bill, we were worried that the bill will be overdue

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,320
and that's why we really needed to make this wire transfer.

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Okay.

120
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
So to be overdue is to be late.

121
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
So think about due.

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,240
This is the time when something has to be done by.

123
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,960
So for example, if the bill for the electricity is due on Wednesday, but I pay it on Thursday,

124
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
it's overdue.

125
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Okay.

126
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,840
So it not only has to do with money, it could also be something that is late.

127
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,000
For example, if I visit my grandma after not going there for three months, you would say

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
this visit is long overdue.

129
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,520
That means Marco should have visited his grandmother earlier, but he didn't.

130
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
That's right.

131
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Okay.

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,440
So a lot of great vocab there all involving banks and different types of words you may

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
find when transferring funds.

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:09,040
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Good morning.

136
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How may I help you today?

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hi.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm here to transfer some money to another account.

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
It's urgent.

141
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Okay.

142
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,400
No, I've never made a transfer before.

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
It's all right.

145
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,040
I will take you through the procedure.

146
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
A company account.

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,440
I need to pay a bill.

149
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Okay.

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,960
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's

151
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,000
address and phone number.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
I have all the information in this folder.

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,760
Well, you've come prepared.

154
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,920
I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

155
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,280
It's a simple transaction and we can process it today.

156
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,760
Oh, that's such a relief.

157
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

158
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,200
Thank you so much.

159
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
It's my pleasure.

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
All right.

161
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
We're back.

162
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,120
So we have three key phrases for you.

163
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,880
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

164
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,480
Fluency Builder.

165
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,840
So our first phrase comes from something that the person at the bank told the client.

166
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,480
That person said, it's all right.

167
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,960
I will take you through the procedure.

168
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Okay.

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,080
So let's look at this word procedure.

170
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,360
Procedure can be many different things, but what is it in this case?

171
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,920
It's basically the steps or the process of taking money from the account and transferring

172
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,960
it to another one.

173
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
That's the procedure.

174
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,760
So we have to do all the steps, you have to fill out the paperwork, you have to sign here

175
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,080
and all these things.

176
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Right.

177
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,960
So we're talking about a wire transfer.

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
So there is a procedure for doing a wire transfer.

179
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,560
That means like you say, there are steps that we have to go through to complete this action.

180
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,200
But we can also have a medical procedure.

181
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,800
So a heart surgery has its own procedure, but that's very different from a wire transfer

182
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
procedure.

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
That's right.

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,400
But it's still, it has different steps and different things that you must do in order

185
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,180
to operate.

186
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,800
But when we have a bank teller who will take us through the procedure, this means that

187
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,040
he or she will help us understand the steps we need to complete.

188
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
That's right.

189
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,000
So this, we could also use this in another bank scenario if maybe my little brother wants

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,640
to open a bank account.

191
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,160
So I'm going to take him through the procedure of what he needs.

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,480
He needs to maybe get a copy of his ID.

193
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,640
He needs to have $20, etc.

194
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Take him through the procedure.

195
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,040
So you're going to help him.

196
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
All right.

197
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
That's right.

198
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,440
So this is something we say about why the person is so anxious to transfer this money.

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,560
The person says, I have a company account.

200
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,520
I need to pay a bill.

201
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,680
So this is why the money is going to be transferred from one place to another to pay the bill.

202
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,280
So this is something we say not just about, you know, company things or business things.

203
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,400
We say about our things at home, like the electricity bill.

204
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
That's right.

205
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
And actually this is more and more common.

206
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,360
We pay our bills using our electronic banking services.

207
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,560
So for example, maybe he needs to pay the electricity bill or the telephone bill and

208
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
this is why we're transferring money.

209
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,120
So to pay a bill is to cancel the bill.

210
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
That's right.

211
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
So I could say, it's time to pay the bills.

212
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
It's the end of the month.

213
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,280
Or, oh shoot, I forgot to pay the bills again.

214
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
They're going to turn my electricity off.

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
That's right.

216
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,720
And now an interesting phrase here, very specific to making transfers.

217
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,440
When we talk about bank routing number, a bank routing number.

218
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,000
Well this is pretty simple actually.

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,600
If you're going to transfer money, you need to be able to tell the bank where the money

220
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
will go.

221
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,520
So you can't just say Mr. Smith.

222
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,040
You have to have a number for the account and each number is unique.

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,080
It's special and it's usually very, very long.

224
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
That's right.

225
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,520
And actually it also has to do with what bank it is because obviously you can't just say,

226
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,600
oh, Bank of USA because, you know, maybe there are two banks with the same name or maybe

227
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,200
there's one Bank of USA in the United States and there's another one in, I don't know,

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
in Europe.

229
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Right.

230
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,320
So you have to have a certain number or letter combination in the bank routing number.

231
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,520
And so the kind of account, is it savings or is it a business account and so on and

232
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,040
so forth so that you know exactly where the money will go because you don't want to give

233
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,360
the money to the wrong person.

234
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
That's right.

235
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Okay.

236
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,560
So a lot of great things on this lesson.

237
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for one last time.

238
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Good morning.

239
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,080
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

240
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,280
How may I help you today?

241
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Hi, I need to transfer some money to another account.

242
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
It's urgent.

243
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Okay.

244
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

245
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,480
No, I've never made a transfer before.

246
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
It's all right.

247
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,120
I will take you through the procedure.

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,920
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

249
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
A company account.

250
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,520
I need to pay a bill.

251
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Okay.

252
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,040
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank's

253
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,080
address and phone number.

254
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,680
I have all the information in this folder.

255
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,840
Well, you've come prepared.

256
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,980
I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

257
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,320
It's a simple transaction and we can process it today.

258
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh, that's such a relief.

259
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,800
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

260
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,280
Thank you so much.

261
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
It's my pleasure.

262
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,800
So Marco, this is really, really important stuff.

263
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,480
Even if you're not talking about the business context, but you're trying to make transactions

264
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
for your personal life.

265
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
That's right.

266
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,560
Just imagine maybe you're abroad, you're in the United States and maybe your parents need

267
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,820
to send you money.

268
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,760
So maybe you need to go to the bank and receive those funds.

269
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,480
So now you have the language and the vocab necessary to more or less talk about a bank

270
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
transfer.

271
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,360
You can say, I was wired money from Spain, for example.

272
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Right.

273
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,680
And one of the most famous places to do this that you'll find all over the United States

274
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,280
is Western Union.

275
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
That's right.

276
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,440
You can go to them and say, I need to transfer money or I need to transfer funds.

277
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,040
And so they will send the money from one Western Union to another Western Union.

278
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,560
And then the person at home or wherever will pick up your money.

279
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,300
And so they will wire the money from one place to another.

280
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
That's right.

281
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
And I think this is how it started.

282
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,880
The wire transferring was, I don't think it was originally with banks.

283
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,360
I think it was something, some sort of service similar to Western Union or maybe Western

284
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Union started it.

285
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
You mean it was like telegraphs?

286
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Yeah, something like this.

287
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
But I don't know if it was from bank to bank.

288
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,560
It's an interesting story though.

289
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,040
We'll have to look it up and let you know.

290
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm not sure of the story either.

291
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,880
But if you're out there and you need to wire some money now you know how to do it.

292
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,640
Well, not how to do it, but you have to talk about it.

293
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,960
We hope you have luck with this.

294
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,320

297
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Bye.
