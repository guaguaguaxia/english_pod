00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello English learners, welcome back to another sports lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,200
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,460
And today we're going to be talking about a very interesting and very difficult game

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,720
to play and it's golf.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,200
So we've got some golf vocabulary for you in this lesson.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,660
And I think we better actually look at a few vocabulary words in vocabulary preview before

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,600
we start with the dialogue.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,680
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,600
On vocabulary preview today we have three words and the first one is aficionado.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Aficionado.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
An aficionado.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
A golf aficionado.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Alright so this basically is a very fancy word of, it's a very fancy way of saying a

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
fan.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,440
Yes, someone who likes something a lot.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,720
Okay so you are an aficionado.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
I like golf.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,360
Yeah, you can also be a wine aficionado.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,720
Okay, so it's kind of like a hobby.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Yeah, you know a lot about it and you like it.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
And now our second word is not anywhere in the dialogue.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,680
No, but we're going to use it when we explain some of these words so you need to know it.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
Okay, the word is club.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Club.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,960
A golf club.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay so a golf club is the tool you use to hit the golf ball.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Right, so it's a long tube basically that looks like a J kind of.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,920
Yeah, so and you hit the ball with it.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,120
So that's a golf club.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,400
And now our third word is golf course.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,640
Golf course.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
A golf course.

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
A course.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,360
So this is the area where you play golf.

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,040
Yeah, it's like the golf field.

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Exactly.

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,920
Yeah, so it's a very big green area where you play golf.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,540
So those are the three words we have for vocabulary preview.

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,040
So now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time as we listen to our sports

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:05,920
announcers, Rick Fields and Bob Copeland and see what happens on this occasion.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Good morning, Golf Aficionados.

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,200
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Thank you, Rick.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,840
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,040
golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of $1 million.

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,400
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,440
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,400
All right, we're here at the eighth hole.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,080
It's par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
to avoid.

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,440
Although, I did see Jack Niclaus hit a hole at one on this very same hole.

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,800
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,640
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

55
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,880
Oh, no, not a good swing at all.

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,600
It's definitely not his day today.

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,200
On the seventh hole, he got a bogey and before that, he barely made par.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,320
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,700
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,280
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
it.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Oh, no, a bear.

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Run, Tiger, run.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
Somebody call animal control.

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,200
So, a pretty exciting ending to that dialogue there.

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,240
A bear on the golf course.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah, I wonder if Tiger is okay.

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,320
I sure hope so because it would be a huge loss to the world of golf.

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Right.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,360
So, we did learn a lot about golf because they use some very specific and technical

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,760
words for golf.

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,520
So, let's look at these now in Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Language Takeaway.

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
All right.

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,300
So, the announcers were talking about the game and they're talking about the course

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:04,000
and they're here on the eighth hole and they said that last time, Jack Nicklaus hit a hole

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
in one.

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Hole in one.

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
A hole in one.

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay, a hole in one.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,280
So, this is when you hit the ball once and the ball goes in the hole.

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Exactly.

83
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,640
So, it's something very difficult to do.

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Yes.

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Right?

86
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
A hole in one.

87
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I've certainly never made one.

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Okay.

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,200
So, sometimes it's also called an ace.

90
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,560
So, it can be a hole in one or called an ace.

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
Ah, okay.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,880
Now, for our second word, now once we get to the hole, to the ninth hole or the tenth

93
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
hole, we have to tee off.

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,480
To tee off.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Tee off.

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
So, when you tee off, you begin playing.

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Right.

98
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,680
So, it's the very first instance where you put the little ball on the tee.

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,760
And you hit the ball for the first time.

100
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Exactly.

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
So, to tee off.

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,400
Now, another golf vocabulary, they were talking about a caddy.

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Right, a caddy.

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
A caddy.

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,320
Now, a caddy is a person.

106
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,200
Yes, it's the person who carries your golf clubs.

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Exactly.

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,240
So, he carries your bag, your golf clubs and basically helps you while you're playing golf.

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,360
Yeah, he tells you which way you should hit the ball and maybe, you know, gives you a

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
nice cold drink and looks after you.

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Very good.

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,720
So, that's a caddy.

113
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,480
And now, the caddy, since he has to carry all the golf clubs, Tiger Woods asked him

114
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,320
for his driver.

115
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
A driver.

116
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Driver.

117
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
A driver.

118
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Now, a driver is a type of golf club.

119
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Right.

120
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
It's not a person.

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
No, no.

122
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a type of golf club and it's a very big and heavy golf club that is used to tee off.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,400
So, it's used to hit the ball a very long way.

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Yes.

125
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,200
That is called the driver.

126
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay, so, and the next thing they were talking about were some different types of scores

127
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,720
that you could get on a hole.

128
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,960
And the first one they mentioned was par.

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,040
Okay, so, you can make par.

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Okay.

131
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,760
So, the par of the course can be four.

132
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,040
Okay, very good.

133
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,560
So, basically, the par is the maximum number of swings or strokes you can make before putting

134
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,040
the ball into the hole.

135
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Right.

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,600
So, it's like the, right, so, when a hole is par four, you should only hit the ball

137
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
four times.

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Four times or less.

139
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Yeah.

140
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Very good.

141
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,760
Now, if you don't make par, there are some options.

142
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,120
You can make a bogey.

143
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Alright, a bogey.

144
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
A bogey.

145
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,000
Now, sometimes the golf course is very difficult.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,760
So, instead of putting the ball in the hole, let's say in four turns, you do it in five.

148
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,280
Okay, so, it's one over par.

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
One over par.

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
So, that's bad.

151
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,160
Yeah, that's bad because you get a point.

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,560
So, it's kind of strange because in golf, the more points you have, the worse you are.

153
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
The worse you are.

154
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Yeah.

155
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
So, that is a bogey.

156
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,520
Now, they also talked about a birdie.

157
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Birdie is the opposite if you hit one under par.

158
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
So, that's good.

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,320
Yeah, that's good because you have minus one.

160
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
One less than par.

161
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,920
Alright, so, this is actually a lot of weird, crazy, strange language.

162
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,520
Birdie, bogey, caddy, driver.

163
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:31,960
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to help us understand?

164
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,600
Good morning, golf aficionados.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,240
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

166
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,760
Thank you, Rick.

167
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,640
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top

168
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,520
golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of $1 million.

169
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,720
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

170
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,480
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

171
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,800
Alright, we're here at the eighth hole.

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,440
It's a par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult

173
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
to avoid.

174
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,640
Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole.

175
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,760
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

176
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,000
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

178
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,200
It is definitely not his day today.

179
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,320
On the seventh hole, he got a bogey and before that, he barely made par.

180
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,000
He'll definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,480
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees.

182
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,640
He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot

183
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
it.

184
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh no, a bear.

185
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,920
Run Tiger, run.

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Body call animal control.

187
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,040
Alright great, so I think it's clear now what type of rules they have in golf and how it

188
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,800
works so why don't we take a look now at some of the phrases that we heard in the dialogue

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,720
in Fluency Builder.

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Fluency Builder.

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,920
Okay, well one of the phrases I want to talk about is something that Bob Copeland said.

192
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,240
He said, as you can see ladies and gentlemen, we're here at beautiful Pebble Beach.

193
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,180
Okay, as you can see.

194
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,560
As you can see.

195
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,840
So this usually goes in the beginning of a sentence.

196
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,280
Yeah, it's a way to say I know you can see this.

197
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm telling you something you know.

198
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,640
Okay, so maybe I'm showing you my house and I can say, as you can see, our living room

199
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,200
is very spacious.

200
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
Yes, so this is actually a really helpful phrase.

201
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,520
It can help you sound really native-like so why don't we hear some examples of how it's

202
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,200
used.

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,720
Example one.

204
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,320
As you can see, we recently remodeled our entire kitchen.

205
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,880
Example two.

206
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,960
As you can see here, the damage to the building is very serious.

207
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,980
Example three.

208
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,120
As you can see, the hair stylist made a mistake when cutting my hair.

209
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,800
Alright great, so as you can see.

210
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,560
Now for our second phrase, well Tiger Woods wasn't doing very well and the announcer

211
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,100
said it's not his day.

212
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,580
It's not his day.

213
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,840
It's not his day today.

214
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,440
Alright, so when it's not your day, you're having a bad time or a bad day.

215
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,980
Right, maybe you're having difficulties or you're having bad luck that day.

216
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:52,640
Yeah, so for example, today I had a headache and I ripped my pants and I spilled coffee

217
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
on myself so it really wasn't my day.

218
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
Okay, it's not your day today.

219
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
No.

220
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,520
Great phrase and also very common and makes you sound very native.

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
That's right.

222
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,240
Now the last phrase, similar to it's not your day, we also heard that Tiger was having a

223
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
hard time.

224
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
Okay, to have a hard time.

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,120
To have a hard time.

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,060
Now if you have a hard time with something.

227
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,840
You have difficulty with it.

228
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,560
Okay, now it's not only related to golf, right?

229
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,680
Of course, you can talk about anything like this.

230
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,720
So I'm having a hard time understanding what this word means.

231
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
Okay, or when I was in school, I had a hard time with math.

232
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,840
Alright, me too.

233
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,840
So to have a hard time means that you have difficulties with something.

234
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,400
So great phrases, great words.

235
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,420
Let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

236
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:56,640
bit more about golf.

237
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Good morning, Golf Aficionados.

238
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,200
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it.

239
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

240
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Thank you, Rick.

241
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,560
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top

242
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,560
golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of $1 million.

243
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,120
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

244
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

245
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
All right, we're here at the eighth hole.

246
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,840
It's par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult

247
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
to avoid.

248
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:37,160
Although, I did see Jack Niclaus hit a hole at one on this very same hole.

249
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,520
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

250
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,000
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

252
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,380
It's definitely not his day today.

253
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,960
On the seventh hole, he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

254
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,080
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

255
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,440
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

256
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot

257
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
it.

258
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Oh no, a bear.

259
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Run, Tiger, run.

260
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Somebody call animal control.

261
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:25,200
All right, so Marco, I know that in the Western business world, golf is actually super important

262
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,920
for your career, isn't it?

263
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,160
Well, many times when you see in movies or the stereotype is that business is done on

264
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
a golf course.

265
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah.

266
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
And yeah, it is true.

267
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,800
But sometimes people will invite you out to a golf course and you'll be playing a game

268
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,840
and talking business and relaxing at the same time.

269
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,760
So maybe you negotiate a deal out on the golf course.

270
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Exactly.

271
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,040
And of course, if you lose, it's a good thing because then the deal will pull through.

272
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Okay.

273
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, actually, I know that it is so important for people who are wanting to do well in business

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,120
and many people who don't speak English as their first language take golf English lessons.

275
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Right.

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,560
So not only golf lessons, like how to play golf, but also in English.

277
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,840
Like how to talk about golf, how to talk to other people and make deals while you're on

278
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
the golf course.

279
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Yeah.

280
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,800
Because like in many other sports, golf has also its slang and its terms and stuff.

281
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
So yeah, it's very interesting and it's one of those cultural things.

282
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
That's right.

283
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,560

Well, I guess I neglected to make a decision.
