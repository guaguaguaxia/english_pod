00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
And today we're bringing you a great office lesson.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,560
That's right, but actually I hope this situation never happens to any of our listeners.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,560
Exactly.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,360
Today we are firing somebody.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
Yikes.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,640
It is a little bit complicated, but maybe you're an HR manager, maybe you are a supervisor,

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,240
and you'll have to do this one day.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,200
So got to learn how, right?

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Exactly.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
All right.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's get started then as we listen to Isabel and Anthony.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,920
Hi Isabel.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:47,800
You wanted to see me?

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,080
Yes, Anthony.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,560
Come on in and have a seat.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,800
Is everything okay?

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,840
You seem a bit preoccupied.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,760
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,880
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Okay.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,240
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,800
We're going to have to let you go.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
What?

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Why?

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,680
I mean, just like that?

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm fired?

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,560
What?

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,120
I resent that.

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,680
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:44,520
You called in sick eight times this month, and you smell like alcohol.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,320
He did sound a little bit like he had too much to drink.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I know.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
He had that kind of-

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Slur.

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Yeah.

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,000
That slow way of talking that made him seem a little bit drunk.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Well, that's definitely something you don't want to do is show up to work with alcohol

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
in your breath.

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Exactly.

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
But you know what?

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,640
There's a lot of great language in this dialogue, so why don't we take a look at it now in Language

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,400
Takeaway.

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
All right.

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, I want to look at three words here.

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,080
Now, the first one, Anthony said that Isabel was preoccupied.

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Preoccupied.

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Preoccupied.

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Okay.

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
So, if somebody is preoccupied-

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
They're not focused.

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Maybe they're a little bit worried.

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,760
Yeah, they're thinking of something else.

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Okay.

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,680
Why don't we take a listen to a few examples of how this word is used?

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,200
Example one.

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,040
James is really preoccupied.

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,440
I think he's having some family problems.

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Example two.

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
Oh, were you talking to me, honey?

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm just really preoccupied with work.

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
All right.

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
So, very clear now.

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Preoccupied.

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
Let's move on to our next word.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Direct impact.

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
Direct impact.

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
A direct impact.

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
All right.

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,800
So, again, Isabel told Anthony that the decision will have a direct impact on his career.

76
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,320
It will have a noticeable or impact or effect on his career.

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Okay.

78
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
So, a direct impact.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,720
And what about our last word?

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,880
Well, Anthony said, I resent that.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Resent.

82
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Resent.

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Okay.

84
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,480
Now, this is spelled exactly like resent, like with an S, right?

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
That's right.

86
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
R-E-S-E-N-T.

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
But you pronounce it like a Z.

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Resent.

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Resent that.

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,480
So, what does it mean if you say, I resent that?

91
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,960
It means, I find that insulting.

92
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,720
I find that to be not true.

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Yes.

94
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Okay.

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
All right, Marco.

96
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,440
Well, how do you use this word?

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,480
Well, if somebody tells you, you're lazy.

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
Okay.

99
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Right.

100
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,840
Then you might say, hey, I resent that.

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Right.

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I do a lot of work.

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm not lazy.

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Yeah.

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,000
So, it's always something that you use after someone insults you.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right.

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Or says something that you find to be not true.

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay.

109
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Resent that.

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,960
And I guess with this, it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll

111
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,160
come back and look at some great phrases.

112
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,200
Hi, Isabel.

113
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
You wanted to see me?

114
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,920
Yes, Anthony.

115
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,840
Come on in and have a seat.

116
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,040
Is everything okay?

117
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,240
You seem a bit preoccupied.

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,240
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,880
Okay.

121
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,520
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,080
We're going to have to let you go.

123
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
What?

124
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Why?

125
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,960
I mean, just like that?

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm fired?

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,600
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
What?

129
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
I resent that.

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,960
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

131
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,320
You called in sick eight times this month, and you smell like alcohol.

132
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah, well, there's some wonderful language in here that you can use when you have to

133
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,840
have a difficult conversation with somebody.

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Right.

135
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,520
So, let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

136
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
Fluency Builder.

137
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,280
We have three phrases here, and the first one is to beat around the bush.

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,440
Okay.

139
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Beat around the bush.

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
Beat around the bush.

141
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Okay.

142
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,320
So, this is an idiomatic phrase.

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,920
So, before we explain it, let's listen to somebody beating around the bush.

144
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,480
Okay.

145
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:02,960
The one thing that I want to tell you, it's so important that I don't like.

146
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,360
I always, sometimes when, all right, here's the deal.

147
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
This is it.

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,840
It's not me.

149
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
It's not this.

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
It's not that.

151
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
It's not you.

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
It's not me.

153
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
It's everyone.

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
It's everything.

155
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Do you understand what I'm saying?

156
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,200
So, as you can tell, the person has something to say, but they're taking a long time to

157
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
say it.

158
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Right.

159
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,600
You're kind of looking for the right or maybe more polite words to say something.

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Exactly.

161
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,000
So, that is to beat around the bush.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,840
Now, the opposite of to beat around the bush is to come out with it.

163
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Okay.

164
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Come out with it.

165
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,280
So, maybe you're talking to your friend and he's beating around the bush, so you can just

166
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,800
say, hey, come out with it.

167
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Tell me.

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Tell me.

169
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Just what is it?

170
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Exactly.

171
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Right.

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Come out with it.

173
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Be direct.

174
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,160
When Isabel finally came out with it, she told Anthony that we're going to have to

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,120
let you go.

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Let you go.

177
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Let you go.

178
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,840
So, this is actually a nicer way of saying you're fired.

179
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Yeah.

180
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
It's a little bit more polite, isn't it?

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Right.

182
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,080
It's, we're going to have to let you go or...

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh, I was let go from my company.

184
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Right.

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,640
So, the synonym for to be fired.

186
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Exactly.

187
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Okay.

188
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,120
So, let's listen to Anthony getting fired one more time and then we'll come back and

189
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,680
talk a little bit more about this difficult situation.

190
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:32,000
Hi, Isabel.

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
You wanted to see me?

192
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,740
Yes, Anthony.

193
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,200
Come on in and have a seat.

194
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
Is everything okay?

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,560
You seem a bit preoccupied.

196
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,440
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

197
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,640
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

198
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,280
Okay.

199
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,920
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

200
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,520
We're going to have to let you go.

201
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
What?

202
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Why?

203
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
I mean, just like that?

204
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm fired?

205
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

206
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,200
What?

207
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,760
I resent that.

208
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,360
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

209
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,280
You called in sick eight times this month and you smell like alcohol.

210
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,600
So, Erica, have you ever fired anyone?

211
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
I have fired a lot of people.

212
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Wow.

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,920
You are a mean person.

214
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Oh, yeah.

215
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, you know, there are some people who really do silly things like come to work drunk.

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,240
And if you do that, you're obviously going to get fired.

217
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,600
But in the United States, actually, there is an interesting way of firing people.

218
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,400
They get a pink slip.

219
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,960
Oh, yeah.

220
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,440
But I guess this is just a little bit different than getting fired.

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,880
You get a pink slip when you get laid off.

222
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Right.

223
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,520
I mean, if you come to work drunk, you get fired immediately, right?

224
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,640
But when you get a pink slip, so it's basically a little pink paper that tells you that you

225
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
have been laid off.

226
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Yeah.

227
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,960
And so when you hear somebody say we sent out.

228
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah.

229
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,720
So when you hear somebody talk about pink slips, like we send like our company sent

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,200
out 500 pink slips, you know, that means that 500 people got laid off or I got a pink slip

231
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
today.

232
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
That means you got laid off.

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Right.

234
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah.

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,840
That's actually interesting because I don't know any other country that actually has this

236
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,760
of special color, special color for firing people.

237
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Yeah.

238
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
How about in your country?

239
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,120
Is there a special color for pink slips?

240
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,560
If you guys have any stories as well, maybe about being fired or maybe you've had to fire

241
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
somebody.

242
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
