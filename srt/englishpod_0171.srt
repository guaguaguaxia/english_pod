00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,560
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,080
So, Marco, what are we talking about here today?

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,760
Today we're going shopping again.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,120
We go shopping a lot here at EnglishPod, but this is an upper intermediate level lesson,

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,200
so we've got some very specific terminology to cover.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Exactly.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,480
We're going shopping for a digital camera, so we're going to be talking about very specific,

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,720
maybe a little bit technical vocab related to this very fascinating and expensive product.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
All right.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,720
I'm very excited.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
I recently purchased a camera, but we won't talk about that yet.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,280
Let's take a listen to the dialogue for the first time, and when we come back, we can

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,800
talk about some of the really interesting details.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Hello, ma'am.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,040
Can I help you find something?

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,200
Yes, actually.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm looking to buy a camera.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,520
We've got a wide selection.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,960
Do you know if you'd like a point and shoot or something a little fancier?

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else?

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,640
Actually, I'm buying a camera for my husband.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,560
Ah, well, then I'd recommend a nice entry level digital SLR.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Yeah.

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Sure thing.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,640
Follow me.

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
This here is the...

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
The Canon EOS.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Yeah, it's okay, but I'm looking for something that performs better in low light, has a better

32
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,120
display panel, and longer battery life.

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,040
Oh, uh, um, the Nikon D60 is a nice option.

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,920
Yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with?

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,360
I don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Uh, well, this one has the, uh...

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Looks to me like an 18 to 55 millimeter lens.

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Pretty standard.

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
That'll do.

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,800
Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything.

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,360
Ah, so, um, can I interest you in any acc...

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Accessories?

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,280
Do you carry polarizing filters?

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Polarizing filters?

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,160
Um, we should.

46
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm sorry, ma'am, looks like we're sold out.

47
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
No, you're not.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,600
There are some right here.

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,280
Oh, well, would you look at that.

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,720
Polarizing filters.

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Thanks for your help, Ralph.

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:21,400
No problem, ma'am.

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Alright we're back.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,440
So apparently this girl knew more than the salesman about this, uh, these things.

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,480
Is this from real life experience?

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Maybe.

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Maybe.

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,400
Uh, well, we can get to that later, like I said, but, uh, there are some very important

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,160
words that anyone who wants to buy a camera should know before they go into the store,

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,440
and these are common across the board.

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,240
So let's take a look at these in today's Language Takeaway.

62
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,720
Language Takeaway.

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,800
Alright, so in Language Takeaway today we have our first, um, difference.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,040
Now it's very important to know the difference between point and shoot camera and the digital

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
SLR.

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,360
Okay, so digital, everyone knows digital now, right?

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
That's the kind of photography we have.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
You don't use film, okay?

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Use the memory card.

70
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,040
Um, to record digital images, but point and shoot are those little cameras where you just

72
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,440
click and it takes a picture.

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,720
There's no lens, a special, there's no additional lens, there's no special add-ons.

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,400
It's a small rectangle and you just take normal pictures.

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
And that's the kind of camera that like my mom uses.

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Everyone usually has those.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,440
I have it in my purse and whatever.

78
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
It's just easy to use.

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,960
Um, but the digital SLR is the kind of camera that's like the old SLR where you have an,

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,560
like an attachment of a, you have a body and you have a lens and they're just much fancier

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,720
and you have to do a lot more on your own to make a nice picture.

82
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,520
Now SLR, that's an acronym.

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,340
Do you know what it stands for?

84
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,080
So an SLR is a single lens reflex camera and that means that there's a lot more you have

85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,960
to do as the photographer to make sure that the picture comes out well.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Right, so it's really interesting because you can actually play with the lens, like

87
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,240
the focus and you know how much light you want to allow it to go in.

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,600
And there's a lot of really, you know, sometimes a little bit difficult things that not many

89
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
people understand.

90
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Exactly.

91
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,720
And so I think that's why it's good to do some research before you buy one because there's

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,440
so many differences across the different cameras.

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,760
Okay, now both on digital SLRs and on point and shoot cameras, you have something that's

94
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,680
called the display panel.

95
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
That's right.

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,400
The display panel is usually covered in plastic and it's the area that tells you how many

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,400
pictures you've taken, how many pictures you can take, if the flash is on, if you're doing

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
an automatic setting.

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,560
So it's like the little computer monitor that tells you what's going on with the camera.

100
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,760
Usually after you take a picture, you can also see how it came out, right?

101
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
In that moment.

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Exactly.

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,720
And so a lot of times with these fancy cameras, you want to know how big the display panel

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,400
is and how good the quality is in the display panel.

105
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,320
Because obviously if you take a picture and it shows up bad in the display panel, you

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
want to take a new one.

107
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,760
But what if it's the display panel that's broken?

108
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Right, right.

109
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Okay, very good.

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,240
And that's actually one of the great advantages of digital cameras that you can actually see

111
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,800
how your picture looks like.

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Exactly.

113
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
In that moment.

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Instant gratification.

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Nice.

116
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
All right.

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,360
Now when she was looking to buy this digital SLR, she mentioned something about a kit lens.

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
Okay, this is fancy camera terminology, right?

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Because if you buy a point and shoot, there's no lens.

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
It's just the camera.

121
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,240
But if you're buying a fancy digital SLR, you can buy the body, which means the machine,

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
but there's no lens.

123
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,400
So normally people will sell, stores will sell cameras with a kit lens.

124
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,360
That means they make a kit or they make a combination for you.

125
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,040
So it's the body and the lens.

126
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Exactly.

127
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
But if you want, you can buy the body and the lens separate.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
Maybe you want a really fancy lens.

129
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Exactly.

130
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,760
So what's the kind of fancy lens we might buy?

131
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
A telephoto lens.

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Ooh.

133
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,200
So these are the really big lenses for super close up shots from a distance, right?

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,960
So you think of maybe professional photographers or photojournalists who had these kinds of

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
lenses.

136
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,320
They're big and they're bulky and they're not for traveling.

137
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,480
Usually you see them in like sporting events, right?

138
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,080
They're on the side of the field and they have these big white, they're usually white

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
lenses on their cameras.

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,720
So you can actually take a very close picture of the action that's far away.

141
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Exactly.

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,320
And it's really good for those kinds of things where you have action or where you're trying

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,200
to get close ups.

144
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,520
And now if one of these accessories that could go well with a telephoto lens or any digital

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
SLR is a polarizing filter.

146
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Okay, so filter is something that takes certain elements out of something else.

147
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,360
So we can filter coffee for example and it takes the coffee grounds out and leaves the

148
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,680
water.

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:02,200
But in a camera, a polarizing filter is something we put onto the glass of the lens to change

150
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,600
the way that light goes into the lens.

151
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay.

152
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,000
So in this way you take a picture maybe of a very sunny day and it will look differently

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,520
if you didn't have this filter.

154
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Exactly.

155
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,400
And you can also have a UV filter which does similar things with UV rays in the sunlight.

156
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,360
And these are just filters or things you put on the camera and polarizing means that you're

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
splitting up the kind of light that goes in.

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Okay.

159
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Very good.

160
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,040
Very technical terms but they're very useful especially if you're looking to buy one of

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,560
these cameras and you're not very familiar with the terms.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,080
But why don't we move on now to some very interesting phrases that we saw in the dialogue

163
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,360
on Fluency Builder.

164
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Fluency Builder.

165
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
All right.

166
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,680
So on Fluency Builder our first phrase today is entry level.

167
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,400
What's an entry level digital SLR?

168
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Okay.

169
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,320
Well entry level is something that we can use for any kind of purchase.

170
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,720
So any kind of thing that we buy.

171
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,680
In the case of a camera, an entry level is not for an expert or professional.

172
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,560
It's something for someone who's buying one for the first time.

173
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Like for beginners.

174
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
For beginners.

175
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,640
So entry level is like entry, beginning, starting.

176
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,520
We can have an entry level job where you don't need training or experience.

177
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,040
An entry level camera where you don't need long experience with fancy cameras.

178
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,520
Or training to know how to use it.

179
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Okay.

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Very good.

181
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,120
So that's an entry level camera but as you mentioned we can also use it for the job.

182
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,560
An entry level job position.

183
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
All right.

184
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,480
What about our second phrase?

185
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Okay.

186
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,960
So this one goes with the telephoto lens, right?

187
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,800
She says I don't need a telephoto lens.

188
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,120
My husband doesn't need a telephoto lens.

189
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,800
It's not like he's going to be stalking celebrities.

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay.

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
So we have this verb here.

192
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
To stalk.

193
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
To stalk.

194
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,280
That means to follow someone around.

195
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Okay.

196
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,580
And to look at them and to watch them and to not leave them alone.

197
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,760
Now she mentioned this because this is a very interesting and closely associated topic with

198
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
photographers.

199
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,480
You know you have the paparazzi who follow celebrities and they have these big telephoto

200
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
lens so they can take pictures of celebrities without them knowing.

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Exactly.

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,640
And so you imagine someone in a tree with a big telephoto lens taking a photo of someone

203
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,960
famous who's you know half a mile away.

204
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,400
And stalking celebrities is something that's a bad thing, right?

205
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

206
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
It's bad.

207
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
But it's very common.

208
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
And also illegal I think.

209
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
And I think it's illegal.

210
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
All right.

211
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
And what about our last phrase?

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
Would you look at that?

213
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,360
Well he said it in a very surprised tone, right?

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,680
Kind of like he didn't really expect to find the polarizing filters.

215
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Right.

216
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
So he's embarrassed.

217
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Okay.

218
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Would you look at that means oh wow I'm surprised.

219
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Right.

220
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Uh huh.

221
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Right.

222
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
So it's awkward.

223
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Right.

224
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,600
So you could say Marco you got a little bit of food on your shirt?

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,960
You've had it for like an hour.

226
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Oh my God.

227
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Would you look at that?

228
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Oh the beans I had.

229
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
That's really embarrassing.

230
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,360
I've got food on my shirt.

231
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,080
So this man who works at the store, he's embarrassed because he didn't know something he should

232
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
know.

233
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Okay.

234
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,360
And so he says oh would you look at that?

235
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
How funny.

236
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
I didn't see those.

237
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,640
Now we can also maybe use it in a sarcastic tone, right?

238
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,560
If I tell somebody can you bring me my glasses that are on the table?

239
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,880
And they're like I can't find them.

240
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
They're not here.

241
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
And then I find them.

242
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Would you look at that?

243
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Here they are.

244
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Right?

245
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
On your head the whole time.

246
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
That's my mom.

247
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Would you look at that?

248
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,360
I've been wearing my glasses the whole time.

249
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Alright.

250
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Very good.

251
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,080
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk about

252
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:52,360
digital SLRs.

253
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Hello ma'am.

254
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Can I help you find something?

255
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes actually.

256
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm looking to buy a camera.

257
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
We've got a wide selection.

258
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Do you know if you'd like a point and shoot or something a little fancier?

259
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else?

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,120
Actually I'm buying a camera for my husband.

261
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,040
Ah well then I'd recommend a nice entry level digital SLR.

262
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Yeah?

263
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

264
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Sure thing.

265
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
Follow me.

266
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
This here is the...

267
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
The Canon EOS.

268
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,080
Yeah it's okay but I'm looking for something that performs better in low light, has a better

269
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,600
display panel and longer battery life.

270
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Oh ah um the Nikon D60 is a nice option.

271
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,480
Yeah but what kit lens does this camera come with?

272
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,240
I don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

273
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,360
Ah well this one has the um...

274
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,320
Looks to me like an 18-55mm lens.

275
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Pretty standard.

276
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
That'll do.

277
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything.

278
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
Ah ha ha.

279
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
So um can I interest you in any acce...

280
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Accessories?

281
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you carry polarizing filters?

282
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Polarizing filters.

283
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Um we should.

284
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm sorry ma'am looks like we're sold out.

285
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
No you're not.

286
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,520
There's some right here.

287
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh well would you look at that.

288
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Polarizing filters.

289
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,280
Thanks for your help...

290
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,840
Ralph.

291
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:23,120
No problem ma'am.

292
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,880
Alright we're back so you mentioned you recently bought a digital SLR camera.

293
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
How's that working out?

294
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I'm loving it.

295
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm...

296
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,800
I have to actually train myself on how to use it because I used to have an old film

297
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,280
camera that had...

298
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,960
It was actually a Nikon as well and it's uh...

299
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,560
It's different using a digital SLR.

300
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,680
There's a lot of things you can do that are very fancy because you...

301
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
You actually...

302
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
There's a computer inside essentially.

303
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
So it's uh...

304
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
It's...

305
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm getting used to it.

306
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
It's fine.

307
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,720
So what's the difference in pictures like from a point and shoot to a digital SLR?

308
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,560
Does it really make a great difference?

309
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,240
Are you very happy with it?

310
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,360
There is a big difference and part of the difference is that you can control every aspect

311
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
of the photo.

312
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,240
So my digital camera was a small little Canon.

313
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
You know the little...

314
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,720
What are they called?

315
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
The Power Shoot?

316
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
And it made...

317
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,520
It took great pictures because you know these cameras have amazing pixel quality.

318
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,680
They have like 7.1 megapixels or like 9.1 megapixels.

319
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,740
So the quality is really good.

320
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,460
But everything looks the same.

321
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:31,440
If I have my digital camera, my digital SLR, I can frame a shot and I can focus on one

322
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,120
person but make everyone else blurry.

323
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,600
I can really make more artistic photos whereas the point and shoot is great for parties and

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
for everyday stuff.

325
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Just like everyday stuff.

326
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Exactly.

327
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Now what about traveling?

328
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You have a dilemma there, right?

329
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,160
Because you visit very beautiful places where you would love to take very nice pictures

330
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,400
with a digital SLR but at the same time the inconvenience of it of actually...

331
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Because they're pretty big.

332
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,460
All of them are pretty big.

333
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,720
So where would you go on that?

334
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,760
Would you use the point and shoot or the digital SLR?

335
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,080
Well that's a good question.

336
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,120
One of the reasons that I picked the lens that I did is because it's not immense but

337
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,280
I really want to be able to do some like landscape photography and I travel a lot so I think

338
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,000
it's worthwhile to suck it up and just take the camera because otherwise why did you buy

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
it, right?

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, that's true.

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,400
Alright, so an interesting topic here on EnglishPod and I'm sure a lot of our users travel around,

342
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,040
like to take pictures or maybe are experts on digital photography so why don't you come

343
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,840
to the website EnglishPod.com.

344
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,680
We'll see you there and until next time.

345
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Bye everyone.

346
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:46,560
For EnglishPod, I'm Dziękuję and have a great weekend.
