00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,880
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,020
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,960
And today we have a great lesson for all our upper intermediate students.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
That's right.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,640
We're talking about airplane travel today.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,100
Airplane travel, right.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,680
So we're going to be in an airplane.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
Yes.

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,720
And we're going to be listening to some of the common things you might hear on an announcement

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
in the airplane.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
Yeah, usually the flight attendant or the captain will come on and say something and

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,520
well, usually it's in English, so we got to understand what they're saying.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
That's right.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,880
And we'll also learn some great phrases that you can use when you want to describe flights

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,840
to your friends when you're talking to them.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,880
Yeah, that always happens.

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,240
You arrive somewhere and people are like, hey, how was your flight?

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,760
Now you know how to answer it.

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Exactly.

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Okay.

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,600
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview?

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Vocabulary preview.

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,840
Well, we've got three words for you here in vocabulary preview all about flying.

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Okay.

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
So what's our first one?

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Turbulence.

29
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Turbulence.

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Turbulence.

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Turbulence.

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,120
So turbulence.

33
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,320
How can we describe this?

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,520
Well, turbulence when you're in an airplane basically is air that is moving in all directions

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
really fast.

36
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Okay.

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
So what happens?

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,120
So the airplane will start to shake.

39
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Okay.

40
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
Right.

41
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Yeah.

42
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,960
It's the same thing if you're flying a kite and maybe some turbulence is in the air, your

43
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,720
kite will maybe fall to the ground.

44
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Oh.

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Yeah.

46
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,960
So it's moving in all directions.

47
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
It's really turbulent.

48
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
All right.

49
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,220
Well, we'll hear how this word is used in the dialogue.

50
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,320
But another airplane word we hear a lot.

51
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Crew.

52
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Crew.

53
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Crew.

54
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Flight crew.

55
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Yes.

56
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
C-R-E-W.

57
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Crew.

58
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
So the flight crew is basically the team.

59
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Yes.

60
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Right?

61
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Yeah.

62
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,960
It's all the people that are in the airplane.

63
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,040
So it's basically the captain and the co-pilot.

64
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Yes.

65
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,320
And all the flight attendants.

66
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Exactly.

67
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
Yeah.

68
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
So it's basically the flight crew.

69
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Yes.

70
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Okay.

71
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640
And what about our last word?

72
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,200
Bumpy ride.

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Bumpy ride.

74
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
A bumpy ride.

75
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
Bumpy.

76
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
Not smooth.

77
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Not smooth.

78
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Yeah.

79
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
So what would be an example of a bumpy ride?

80
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Okay.

81
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,120
Imagine if you're driving in your car and you're driving on a dirt road, like with many

82
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
holes in it and everything.

83
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
And rocks and everything.

84
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Yes.

85
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
You're driving on that road and it would be really, really bumpy.

86
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Right.

87
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,760
So your car will be moving a lot.

88
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
And shaking.

89
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Yeah.

90
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,520
So a bumpy ride is a trip where you move and shake a lot.

91
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,800
It's kind of uncomfortable.

92
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,340
So you can say, that is a bumpy road.

93
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,520
Or it was a bumpy ride.

94
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,880
Or it was a bumpy ride.

95
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Yeah.

96
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
Okay.

97
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
So now let's listen to our dialogue.

98
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,880
We're going to be listening to these people on an airplane and the captain is going to

99
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
give some instructions.

100
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:58,080
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the...

101
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Oh.

102
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,560
Did you feel that?

103
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Yeah.

104
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Don't worry about it.

105
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

106
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

107
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,520
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air.

108
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,440
So we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

109
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
This is why I hate flying.

110
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,400
At this time, I'd like to remind all of our passengers to fasten their seatbelts and remain

111
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,000
seated until the fasten seatbelt sign is turned off.

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

113
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

114
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Did you hear that?

115
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Oh my God.

116
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Brent!

117
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,200
Don't worry about it.

118
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
This is totally normal.

119
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
It happens all the...

120
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,760
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

121
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,520
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us.

122
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,200
And so for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

123
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,120
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,080
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seatbelt

125
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
sign has been switched off.

126
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
We can expect...

127
00:03:51,080 --> 00:04:21,040
Well, here we are with another dramatic dialogue, another explosion in English.

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
What's happening?

129
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I don't know.

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
A lot of adventure is going on.

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
So we'll see what happens.

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,080
But I'm sure they're all right.

133
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Don't worry, everyone.

134
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm sure.

135
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Well, I hope so.

136
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
It's kind of making me nervous for my next flight.

137
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,360
All right.

138
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,200
So let's take a look at some of the words that the captain used in language takeaway.

139
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Language takeaway.

140
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
All right.

141
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,720
All of these words you'll hear really, really often when you're flying.

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,440
And the first one we have for you is fasten.

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Fasten.

144
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Fasten.

145
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,760
Fasten your seatbelt.

146
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,080
Now this is a great word.

147
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Fasten means to...

148
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Do up.

149
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,400
Do up or put on or...

150
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Connect.

151
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Connect, right?

152
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,280
So usually it'll be with a seatbelt or a belt or something like that, right?

153
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,480
Now the pronunciation here is interesting.

154
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
It's spelt F-A-S-T-E-N.

155
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Right.

156
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
So it would be fasten.

157
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
No.

158
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
No, right?

159
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Fasten.

160
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Fasten.

161
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,220
The T kind of becomes silent.

162
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
So it's fasten.

163
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,220
Yep.

164
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Okay.

165
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Let's look at our next word.

166
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,220
Lavatory.

167
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
Lavatory.

168
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,220
Lavatory.

169
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
Lavatory.

170
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,220
Okay.

171
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,240
So what is a lavatory exactly?

172
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Because I'm always confused.

173
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,920
What's the difference between bathroom, restroom, washroom, WC, lavatory?

174
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I know.

175
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
So many words for bathroom.

176
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,680
A lavatory is a room with a toilet and sink only.

177
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Only a toilet and sink.

178
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
So no bathtub.

179
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
No.

180
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
No shower either.

181
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
No shower.

182
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,520
So it's very, very common to find a lavatory in boats, airplanes, or in trains.

183
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Yep.

184
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
But never in your house.

185
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Never in your house, right?

186
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,120
Even if your room in your house is only a sink and a toilet, it's still not a lavatory.

187
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
It's a bathroom.

188
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Yeah.

189
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Okay.

190
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't know why.

191
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,080
That's just the way it is in English.

192
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,320
And something interesting that you told me today, WC, right?

193
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,240
That's a common thing that you'll see on a bathroom.

194
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Yep.

195
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
What does that stand for?

196
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Water closet.

197
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Water closet.

198
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Yep.

199
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Wow.

200
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I didn't know that.

201
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Yeah.

202
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Water closet.

203
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Okay.

204
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Anyways, let's take a look at our next word.

205
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Stow.

206
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Stow.

207
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
To stow.

208
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Yes.

209
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Stow your luggage.

210
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Stow your luggage.

211
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,000
So if I stow my luggage, it means?

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,200
You put it in a place where you can get it easily, but it is very safe.

213
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Maybe it's not even visible, right?

214
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Yeah.

215
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
So you put it away in a safe spot.

216
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Okay.

217
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,840
So usually in airplanes, they will tell you to stow your luggage under your seat.

218
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Yes.

219
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,920
Or stow your luggage in the overhead bin.

220
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,800
Overhead bin or overhead compartment.

221
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Yes.

222
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Okay.

223
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
And our last word.

224
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Refrain.

225
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Refrain.

226
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Refrain.

227
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,360
Refrain from doing something.

228
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,040
So this is a verb, meaning avoid doing.

229
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Avoid doing.

230
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Do not do.

231
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Exactly.

232
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,120
Something interesting about this grammar-wise is it's usually followed by from.

233
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Yeah.

234
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Refrain from.

235
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,560
And the verb that follows is always gerund, right?

236
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah.

237
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
So refrain from ing.

238
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Right.

239
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,880
Refrain from using the lavatory.

240
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Yes.

241
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Refrain from smoking.

242
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,400
Refrain from smoking.

243
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay.

244
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
So refrain from.

245
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Yep.

246
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
All right.

247
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,000
So some really great examples in language takeaway.

248
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yep.

249
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,160
And well, now let's take a look at Fluency Builder and see some of these great phrases.

250
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Fluency Builder.

251
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
All right.

252
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Three phrases we have for you here.

253
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,000
The first one, remain seated.

254
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
Remain seated.

255
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,400
Remain seated.

256
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Remain seated.

257
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
So to remain seated.

258
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Really simple.

259
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,800
To stay sitting.

260
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
To stay on your seat.

261
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Don't stand up.

262
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes.

263
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,600
This is really important in airplanes, right?

264
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,880
Yeah, because otherwise if there's turbulence, you could, you know, end up flying around

265
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
the airplane.

266
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Or fall, exactly, and hurt yourself.

267
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Remain seated.

268
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Now, one of the reasons they had to remain seated was because they were going to go through

269
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,000
a patch of rough air.

270
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
Patch of rough air.

271
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
So patch.

272
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Now, interesting.

273
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Okay.

274
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,240
So patch is a small area, right?

275
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Yeah.

276
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
So a small area of turbulence.

277
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
A small area of turbulence.

278
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,720
Now, what would be another example of patch?

279
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Maybe a patch of strawberries.

280
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,040
So it's like a little strawberry garden, right?

281
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Yes.

282
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Or a patch of grass.

283
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Patch of grass.

284
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,480
Usually in front of your house, you'll have a little patch of grass.

285
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Yep.

286
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Okay.

287
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
So patch of.

288
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
And now our last phrase.

289
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Suspend.

290
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Suspend.

291
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,880
Suspend in flight service.

292
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Yeah.

293
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
So stop for a short time.

294
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,920
Stop for a short time.

295
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,800
So you could suspend your work.

296
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Yeah.

297
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,880
And if you're going on vacation, you could suspend your subscription to the newspaper.

298
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Okay.

299
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,600
So suspend to temporarily stop.

300
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes.

301
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Okay.

302
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
So we've covered a lot of vocabulary and some great phrases.

303
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one more time, and we'll come back and talk about

304
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:26,960
flying.

305
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,080
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the.

306
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
Oh, did you feel that?

307
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,960
Yeah, don't worry about it.

308
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

309
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,280
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

310
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,400
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air.

311
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,560
So we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

312
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,240
This is why I hate flying.

313
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,680
At this time, I'd like to remind all our passengers to fasten their seat belts and remain seated

314
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,840
until the fasten seat belt sign is turned off.

315
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,120
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

316
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

317
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Did you hear that?

318
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,280
Oh my God, Brent.

319
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Don't worry about it.

320
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
This is totally normal.

321
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
It happens all the.

322
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,640
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

323
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,080
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us, and so for your safety, we will

324
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
be suspending in-flight service.

325
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,000
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

326
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,960
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seat belt

327
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
sign has been switched off.

328
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
We can expect.

329
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Erica, have you ever had a turbulent flight like this?

330
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,160
No, no, never this bad.

331
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
A little bit of turbulence.

332
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,080
Actually, I kind of like turbulent flights.

333
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Why?

334
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,760
It's sort of like, I don't know, it's kind of fun.

335
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,360
You get shaken around and your stomach moves up and down.

336
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
You don't get nervous?

337
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,240
No, I get a little excited.

338
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,640
Well, it is true that flying is actually very, very safe, right?

339
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Yeah.

340
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,160
I know we all hear that more people are killed in car accidents than flight accidents.

341
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,760
So it's very, very safe.

342
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,920
So yeah, I don't worry about the turbulence.

343
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,240
Knock on wood.

344
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,360
But yeah, so flying is really safe and you know, as long as you remain seated, you fasten

345
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
your seat belt and you, you know, you follow the instructions, you shouldn't have any problems.

346
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,840
Actually, that's a really good point because actually when I was reading about flight turbulence

348
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,880
for this dialogue, I kept reading all these stories about these people who, you know,

349
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,320
when they got into some turbulent air were, you know, knocked over or they ended up like

350
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,760
actually literally flying through the cabin and getting really badly hurt.

351
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,560
So everyone, you got to fasten your seat belt.

352
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
Yes, remain seated.

353
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Yeah.

354
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,000

355
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200

And we know that you travel a lot, so be safe, right?

358
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Yeah.

359
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,240
And use this language to describe your flight.

360
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Okay.

361
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,560

Marco and I are always there.

365
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,520

366
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,240

Bye.

370
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Bye.

371
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Bye.
