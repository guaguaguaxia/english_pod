00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome back English learners.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,120
My name is Marco and I'm joined here by the lovely...

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Erika.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,600
And today we're going to be bringing you another great lesson, one of the lessons that you

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
requested.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Actually, Maxim, Maxim S requested this one.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Right.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,880
I think he's really into research and investigation.

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,120
So we're bringing you a great lesson about this topic.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Okay.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,940
So I'm really excited to hear this dialogue all about research.

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:40,240
So why don't we start listening to two university professors discussing an important question.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,360
We've been over this a thousand times.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,960
The data is irrefutable.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,120
Look, we've done extensive research, built studies and read the literature, and there

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,960
is conclusive evidence to support my theory.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,440
Horowitz, I beg to differ.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,840
Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,420
You know as well as I do, the collection of data was not systematic and there's a large

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,600
margin of error.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,340
To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,220
That is preposterous.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,340
You are trying to single handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries and yet

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,740
you're oblivious to the fact that you're wrong.

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,460
I am not wrong.

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,860
The chicken came first.

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,260
No, the egg came first.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
The chicken.

30
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,260
Egg.

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
The egg.

32
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,260
The chicken.

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,260
The egg.

34
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,460
All right, so interesting.

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,780
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

36
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,620
It's an age old question, isn't it?

37
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,100
And apparently they are not going to agree anytime soon.

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,680
All right, well, what they can agree about is this awesome language.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,580
So why don't we take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,540
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,020
Okay on Language Takeaway today we have some really great words and this first one is really

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
good.

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,020
Irrefutable.

44
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,020
Irrefutable.

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,020
Irrefutable.

46
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,900
The data is irrefutable.

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,540
Okay so if the professor says that the data is irrefutable, what does he mean by that?

48
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,420
He's saying that you cannot deny it.

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,120
It is really, really true.

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
It is really true.

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,980
There is no way this is a lie.

52
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Exactly.

53
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
Okay.

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,460
Irrefutable evidence for example.

55
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,260
Yeah, that's a great phrase.

56
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,540
All right, so the professor complained that Dr. Horowitz's experiment was flawed.

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,900
Flawed.

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,620
Flawed.

59
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,260
So flawed, is that an adjective, a verb or a noun?

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,620
It is an adjective here.

61
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,940
Now when something is flawed, there is a problem with it, right?

62
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
There's a mistake.

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
Okay, so it has an error.

64
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Yeah.

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940
Okay.

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,460
So the professor is saying that his experiment has a flaw.

67
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,140
A mistake, exactly.

68
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,580
So flawed is the adjective of a flaw.

69
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
Right.

70
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Okay.

71
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,980
Now the reason that his study or his experiment was flawed is because it was not systematic.

72
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Systematic.

73
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Systematic.

74
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,820
So systematic, that's an interesting word.

75
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,500
Now I think we can recognize the word system in here, right?

76
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Right.

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,180
So when something is systematic, it follows a process.

78
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,180
A certain order.

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,340
Yes, a certain system.

80
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Right.

81
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,180
So that's basically what systematic means, to follow a certain order, to be more organized,

82
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
right?

83
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Exactly, yeah.

84
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
Okay.

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
And what about our next word?

86
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Preposterous.

87
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,180
Preposterous.

88
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
Preposterous.

89
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,140
That is preposterous.

90
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,540
I love this phrase.

91
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,060
It usually goes together, right?

92
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
That is preposterous.

93
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
Yeah.

94
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,540
Okay, so what does it mean when I say that?

95
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,740
It means it's absurd.

96
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,740
It's ridiculous.

97
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
Right.

98
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
It doesn't make sense.

99
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,300
I can't believe you said that.

100
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
All right.

101
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,340
Well, this is a really interesting phrase, but I think it's a little bit more common

102
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,980
when it's used by older people.

103
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Yeah.

104
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,020
I don't think, I don't really see a young person going up to someone and say, hey, that's

105
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
preposterous.

106
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,940
Yeah, but it is a wonderful phrase.

107
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,300
Now our final phrase for takeaway, oblivious.

108
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,780
Oblivious.

109
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,380
You're oblivious to the facts.

110
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,660
So a person that is oblivious to something.

111
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,620
They don't know or they're unaware.

112
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,980
Okay, so they ignore maybe the facts or they don't see it.

113
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
Yeah.

114
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,940
You're oblivious to the fact that we're in a recession.

115
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,740
Okay, or he is completely oblivious.

116
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,980
You can just say it like that, right?

117
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
Yeah, he doesn't know.

118
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,020
Okay, so we took a look at some of the great vocabulary we found in the dialogue, but there

119
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,460
were also some really good phrases that I think we should look at.

120
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,740
Okay, and let's take a look at those in Putting It Together.

121
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,740
Putting It Together.

122
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,140
You know, Marco, one of the things I love about English is the way that words seem to

123
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,420
fit together, like blocks coming together.

124
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,620
And here we have a lot of great examples of these words that fit together really nicely.

125
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,580
Okay, so why don't we look at those?

126
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,140
And our first one now is extensive research.

127
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,420
Extensive research.

128
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Extensive research.

129
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,020
All right, so we know extensive means?

130
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
A lot.

131
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
A lot.

132
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
Yeah.

133
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,740
So that's really good when you put it together, extensive research.

134
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,460
It means you have?

135
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
A lot of research.

136
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,540
You have really studied, you have really looked things up.

137
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay, extensive research.

138
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,060
Another great research-related phrase here is conclusive evidence.

139
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,420
Conclusive evidence.

140
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,420
Conclusive evidence.

141
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,200
All right, now, the first word there, conclusive.

142
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,380
When something is conclusive, you can't argue with it.

143
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,580
It's the final decision.

144
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,620
All right, well, the professor complained that Horowitz's investigative approach was

145
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,380
flawed, right?

146
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,780
So this is our next phrase, investigative approach.

147
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,260
Investigative approach.

148
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Investigative approach.

149
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,060
Okay, so I remember the word investigate is a verb.

150
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,060
Yes.

151
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
But in this case, it's a?

152
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
It's an adjective.

153
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
It's an adjective.

154
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,020
So when something is investigative, it's obviously having to do with?

155
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,900
An investigation.

156
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,020
So the approach or the...

157
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,500
So when he said investigative approach.

158
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Just the...

159
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,980
I mean, just simply the way you investigate the problem.

160
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,780
The way he investigated.

161
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,080
Okay, very interesting.

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,020
What about this other phrase that I saw?

163
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,740
It was really interesting.

164
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,380
Definitive conclusion.

165
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,780
Definitive conclusion.

166
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,020
So a definitive conclusion.

167
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,260
All right, well, again, I think we know the word conclusion, right?

168
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Okay.

169
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,180
So it's a final judgment or decision.

170
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
All right.

171
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,900
When something is definitive, you can't argue with it or change it.

172
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:03,780
Okay, so the conclusion or the final result is final, like there is no way of arguing

173
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
it.

174
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Exactly.

175
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Okay.

176
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,780
All right.

177
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Well, that's great language.

178
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:16,660
So why don't we listen to it one more time in the dialogue?

179
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,780
We've been over this a thousand times.

180
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,580
The data is irrefutable.

181
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,580
Look, we've done extensive research, built studies and read the literature, and there

182
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,420
is conclusive evidence to support my theory.

183
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,860
Horowitz, I beg to differ.

184
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,280
Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed.

185
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,860
You know as well as I do, the collection of data was not systematic and there's a large

186
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,020
margin of error.

187
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,780
To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading.

188
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,660
That is preposterous.

189
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,780
You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet

190
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,180
you're oblivious to the fact that you're wrong.

191
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,900
I am not wrong.

192
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,300
The chicken came first.

193
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,700
No, the egg came first.

194
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
The chicken.

195
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Egg.

196
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
The chicken.

197
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
The egg.

198
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
The chicken.

199
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
The egg.

200
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,700
The egg.

201
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
The chicken.

202
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
The egg.

203
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
The egg.

204
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
So, an interesting question.

205
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,100
What do you think?

206
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,020
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

207
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,940
Well, you ask me, it was the egg.

208
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
It was the egg?

209
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Yeah.

210
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Interesting.

211
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,580
What about why did the chicken cross the road?

212
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
To get to the other side.

213
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,100
Do you think that's really the reason?

214
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,780
Well, there's a million different reasons, but this is great.

215
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,540
I'm glad you brought that up because this is like the classic English joke.

216
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,060
The classic English joke, right?

217
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,780
Why did the chicken cross the road?

218
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,780
And the answer is always...

219
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,700
Well, there are a million answers.

220
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,660
So do you guys know any chicken jokes?

221
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Yeah.

222
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,460
Why don't you come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and on the comment section, why don't you

223
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,740
leave us your thoughts on what came first, the chicken or the egg, and why do you think

224
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,940
the chicken crossed the road?

225
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
All right.

226
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,860
Well, we really look forward to hearing your ideas, and Marco and I will be around to answer

227
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860

So I think we're out of time for today, but thanks for listening, and...

229
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
We'll see you there.

230
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Goodbye.

231
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
Bye.
