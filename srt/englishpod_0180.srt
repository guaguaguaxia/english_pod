00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
And my name is Catherine and it's the holiday season.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
That's right.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,120
It's almost Christmas and so we are bringing you one of the most typical Christmas songs

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,840
or Christmas carols I guess in all over the world probably.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,280
That's right and I've heard it in many different languages, even Chinese.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Yeah, even Chinese.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Ding dong dang.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Ding dong dang.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Okay, I'll have to ask.

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah, you have to ask.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,880
But yeah, we're talking about Jingle Bells today.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,320
So the famous song Jingle Bells, you'll hear it everywhere, especially during the Christmas

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,360
season, only during the Christmas season.

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,200
And so let's listen to the song.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
The song is pretty long.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,560
It has like a couple of different verses.

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,320
But we've taken the main one, the first one, and the chorus, which are like the most famous

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
ones.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,320
And so let's listen to the song.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,320
This is going to be stuck in my head all day, Marco.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
I know.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,080
It's kind of catchy though.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,120
How can you not get into the spirit with this song?

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,480
Well, as you said, a carol, a Christmas carol is a song and they're meant to be catchy.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,480
You get them in your head and they stay there forever.

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,640
I think it's also because every mall or shopping center you go to, they're playing these songs.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,400
So they just kind of get stuck in your head.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,080
In the background all the time.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,560
It makes you want to shop more.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,960
Or kill someone.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,280
Alright, so there were probably a couple of different words that you didn't understand

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
here.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,160
So we're going to go through the whole song little by little and we'll explain it.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
So starting out with the first line, it says, dashing through the snow.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
Well, okay.

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
This is interesting because in sports, there's an event called a 100 meter dash.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,080
Okay, so a dash is a very quick run.

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Very fast, right?

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
That's right.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,920
So dashing through the snow is you're kind of running or going through the snow very

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
quickly.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,600
Right, we don't know who is running through the snow but we know something or someone

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,680
is going very quickly through the snow.

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
And in the second line it says, in a one horse open sleigh.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Okay, so now we know who's dashing through the snow.

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
It's a horse.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,640
It's a horse and you're in a sleigh.

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Okay, so an open sleigh means that there's no roof.

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,040
So you're sitting under the stars and there's a horse pulling your sleigh through the snow.

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,880
Okay, so a sleigh is kind of like a vehicle for the snow, right?

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
There's no wheels.

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Okay, because it's hard to drive in snow and so this is an old kind of vehicle that has

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,240
maybe wood or metal underneath to make it slide.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
To make it slide, very good.

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Alright and then we have this strange word here.

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,960
It's o apostrophe er, or, or the field we go.

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,200
Or the field we go.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Well, this is very, very common in poetry.

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Okay.

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,080
So this is a way to make the word over shorter because over, you can hear it, two syllables,

64
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
over.

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
But sometimes we only want one.

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
So we say or.

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay, or the fields we go.

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
It's over.

69
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay, interesting.

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,160
Laughing all the way.

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
Bells on bobtails ring.

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,800
Now what are bobtails?

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,640
What are these bells on bobtails?

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,280
Okay, well bobtails are the tails of certain animals, okay?

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,880
So we could say we have a bunny rabbit with a bobtail.

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,800
That means the tail sticks up.

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,720
But it's also maybe reindeer have bobtails because their tails stick up.

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
You can see them.

79
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,640
Okay, so I guess in this case, because it's Christmas, these animals like reindeer and

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
rabbits have little bells on them.

81
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,640
And according to the next line, making spirits bright, right?

82
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,120
So you're making people happy.

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
That's right.

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,600
Spirit is your, your attitude or your soul.

85
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,760
And in this case, you're being made happy.

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
You're happy because it's Christmas.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
You're outside.

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Very good.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,240
And well, he says, what fun it is to laugh and sing a slaying song tonight.

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,760
Now slaying, we know that slay is this vehicle to go through the snow.

91
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,520
But a slaying song, I guess is.

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,320
Is the song we sing when we're in a slay.

93
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,000
So this isn't a real word, but this is something that makes the song kind of makes you think

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
that these people are just singing a special song for being in a slay.

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
All right.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,480
Let's go to the chorus, jingle bells, jingle bells.

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,960
So this word jingle, it's a verb, right?

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Yeah.

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,600
To jingle, we can do it with your keys too.

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,560
To jingle is to make noise when metal is touching metal.

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,400
So we have bells and they ding ding ding ding ding.

102
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
They hit each other.

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I got some keys here.

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I'll show you what jingling is.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
So we go like this.

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh, jingle.

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
To jingle your keys, right?

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Yeah, exactly.

109
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
So you can use it with keys, with bells.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
Can you use it with anything else?

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
Anything that makes it sound like that?

112
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Chimes, jingle.

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Okay, chimes, jingle.

114
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,240
All right, very good.

115
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
So jingle all the way.

116
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Oh, what fun it is to ride again in a one horse open sleigh.

117
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,400
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,640
So all the way, maybe we're going someplace.

119
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,120
All the way, wherever you're going, right?

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
Home or to dinner.

121
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,760
And oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

122
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,880
So the chorus is not very hard and neither is the first verse, but you know, sometimes

123
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,160
the song is pretty fast, so sometimes you don't really understand what they're saying.

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,320
Personally, I did not know the lyrics of Jingle Bells until we started doing this podcast.

125
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Really?

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, because when we sing it, we mumble.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
You know, you can't hear all the words.

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,520
So jingle bells, jingle bells, you don't know the words, but dashing through the snow.

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,400
Sometimes you have to just think of it very clearly.

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Very good.

131
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,380
So that's all the words we have for this podcast.

132
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,120
It's a very good Christmas carol.

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,800
It's very catchy and I don't know how old it is.

134
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,000
I've heard it since I was small.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,040
Well probably old enough to come from a time when there weren't cars because there was

136
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
sleigh.

137
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,480
And when they used ore, because I don't see people use ore anymore.

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,000
No, I think it's mostly just songs and poems.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,680
You see it a lot in the 19th century.

140
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,440
But it is interesting also, I guess, the relationship between the sleighs and snow.

141
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,960
Christmas is always related to this, even though in some places you don't have snow

142
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
during Christmas.

143
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
That's right, but it does.

144
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,360
I mean, we're here in Shanghai and we can hear people singing this song, so.

145
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
And there's no snow.

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,480
So I think it's just a way to think about the season of Christmas and the attitude of

147
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,240
people when it's Christmas time.

148
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Right.

149
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
So I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

150
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,180
If you have any questions about this Christmas carol, you can let us know on EnglishPod.com.

151
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,520
And we'll also post the other verses, the less known verses of Jingle Bells because

152
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
it's actually a pretty long song.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Very long and I don't know any of the other verses to be honest with you.

154
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Exactly.

155
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,000
We'll post the first one and the chorus because it's the most popular one.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
So we'll see you guys there and Merry Christmas!

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Merry Christmas!

158
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:44,840
Bye.
