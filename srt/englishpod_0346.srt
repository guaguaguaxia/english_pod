00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,120
My name is Catherine and we're going to be purchasing some wine today, right Marco?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
That's right.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,080
Today we're going to go to the shop and we're going to try to look for some wine that will

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,840
go well with the type of food that we're having.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,840
All right.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,000
So we're going to be learning a lot of specific terms.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,760
This is an advanced lesson.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,620
So we expect that most of the basics you already know, but some of these more difficult words

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,240
and phrases are going to be our focus.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,240
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Hello there.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,600
Welcome to Wine World.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,680
Yes, please.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,900
I could really use some help.

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,240
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and I don't know what kind of wine

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
I should bring.

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,040
Do you know what kind of food will be served?

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,120
Well, his wife is Japanese.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,760
He said she makes really good sushi.

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,880
That's a bit of a challenge.

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,920
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,600
Well, let's see.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,320
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Why?

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,000
Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,680
No, I don't think so.

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,880
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,200
You need a white wine which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
I see.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,760
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

35
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,160
That's a white wine, right?

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,400
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,360
I'd suggest you go for something brighter like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,120
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
What's that?

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
That's another varietal or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's see.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,360
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,040
flavors and a bone-dry finish.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Serve chilled.

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh no, how long will it take to chill the wine?

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm on my way to dinner now.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,840
Oh, it's okay, don't worry.

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,320
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

50
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,320
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley White would

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
be lovely.

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,360
All right, what varietal is that?

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,640
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,240
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,560
in the final flavor of the wine.

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,080
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
And you think this is a good wine?

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,920
Yes, this is one of our best sellers.

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,320
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
more approachable.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
It's light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,600
Perfect, I'll take it.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,920
All right, we're back.

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280
So now we're talking about wines, and one of the first things that really pop up is

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,120
when we're talking about sushi and how we're trying to get a wine to go well with sushi.

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,040
All right, so the phrase here was to pair with wine.

67
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,760
So sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,080
All right, so when you talk about wine, you talk about pairing it with food, P-A-I-R,

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
to pair.

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
That's right.

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,280
So for example, if you're having meat or poultry or chicken, you try to pair it with a wine

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,400
so basically that the flavors go well together.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,160
So commonly we say that red wine pairs well with red meat, or fish and white wine pair

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
well together.

75
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,080
So you're pairing these two things means you're using them in the same meal.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
That's right.

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Okay.

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,480
So when we're talking about pairing a wine with sushi, the girl said, well, what about

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
red wine?

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
Wouldn't that pair well with sushi?

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,040
And the attendant said, no, the red wine would be a jarring contrast.

82
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,160
So first of all, we have this word jarring.

83
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,640
Something is jarring if it's loud, shocking, abrasive, difficult, annoying.

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,520
So something that's jarring is loud.

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,360
And a contrast is something that shows the differences in something.

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
That's right.

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,600
So when we're saying that it would be a jarring contrast to have sushi with red wine, we're

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,680
saying that they're just too different.

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,360
Sushi is too different from the red wine flavor, so they wouldn't go well together.

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
That's right.

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,920
And since jarring means it's a bad thing, we think the flavor will be wrong.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
It'll be bad.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,280
So we need to look for something else.

94
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,040
And the salesperson suggested a wine that has more subtle flavors, white wine.

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
That's right.

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,920
So this word subtle is actually spelled S-U-B-T-L-E, but the B is silent.

97
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
That's right.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
So we say subtle.

99
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,240
And it's actually great because it's kind of like the opposite of jarring.

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,640
Something that's not jarring is subtle.

101
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Right.

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,160
So it's a little bit more, I don't know, like relaxed, like not as loud.

103
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
It's not obvious.

104
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
You have to really think about it and look for it.

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,760
Something that's subtle is not obvious.

106
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
That's right.

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,920
And now we're talking about one specific type of white wine.

108
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
We have a Chardonnay.

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
All right.

110
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,560
So we know that there are many, many different kinds of wine out there, but there are some

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
very common ones.

112
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,760
And Chardonnay is one of those.

113
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,280
I think Chardonnay tends to be a bit fruitier.

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,720
Australia has some famous Chardonnays.

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,120
California has some famous Chardonnays.

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,840
Just remember that Chardonnay is a kind of white wine.

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
That's right.

118
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,280
And one of the ways that they used it to describe Chardonnay is that it's one of the more

119
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
full-bodied whites.

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
All right.

121
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,080
So whites here, we're talking about white wines, but something that's full-bodied.

122
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
What does that mean, Marco?

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,120
So if a wine is full-bodied, it means that it has a little bit of a stronger flavor,

124
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,760
like it's a more complete flavor.

125
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
It's not as subtle.

126
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
All right.

127
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,040
So we know that white wines are a bit more subtle than red wines in this case, but within

128
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,640
white wines, you can have one that's very full-bodied.

129
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
So this is a great phrase for describing wine.

130
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
We don't really talk about other things being full-bodied, but wine can be full-bodied if

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,120
it really has what you say, Marco, this big full taste, a bright taste.

132
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
That's right.

133
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,120
And actually the sales attendant suggested that, well, since the Chardonnay is too or

134
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
is more full-bodied, then he would recommend maybe a Sauvignon Blanc.

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
All right.

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
So Sauvignon Blanc.

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Blanc is the French word for white, but we use this all the time in English.

138
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Sauvignon Blanc being the kind of wine.

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,520
Again, it's a white wine.

140
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,800
And it's a bit brighter than the Chardonnay.

141
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
That's what the salesperson said.

142
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
That's right.

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,360
And when we're talking about wines, either red wines or white wines, the way to describe

144
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,880
it or the different varieties is actually a varietal of the wines or the type of grape.

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Right.

146
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,920
So varietal.

147
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,880
So you think of variety, varietal.

148
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,960
Varietal is a specific wine word that we use to describe the kind of grape that go into

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,080
a wine.

150
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,880
So we know wine generally comes from grapes.

151
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
They're crushed down.

152
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,280
And then the alcohol comes from all the sugars.

153
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,120
But each different kind of grape has a different flavor.

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,640
And that's the varietal, the kind of grape.

155
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
That's right.

156
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,320
So just think of it as the variety of the wines that you have.

157
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,320
And it's a word used specifically for wines.

158
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,600
And well, when the attendant kept talking about the wines and the types of wines they

159
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,880
have there, he mentioned that they have a small selection in the refrigerator or in

160
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
the cooler.

161
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,240
So selection in this case means what the store has to offer.

162
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,760
It means all the wines that they sell.

163
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,160
So maybe if you have an extensive selection, it means you have many, many, many different

164
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,880
kinds to choose from.

165
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,240
But if you don't have an extensive selection, you have very few wines, that means that you

166
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,880
have fewer things to sell.

167
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
That's right.

168
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,760
So a wide selection of wines or a small selection of wines.

169
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,680
And lastly, talking about varietals, we also have what we call a blend, a blend of a few

170
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
different types of grapes.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Right.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
So you can have blends of different things.

173
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,040
But in terms of wine, we're talking about using different grapes together to make one

174
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
wine.

175
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
All right.

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,480
So this is something that's pretty common and it's a way to achieve different flavors.

177
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
That's right.

178
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
So a blend.

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,760
You also talk about it in, I think, whiskeys.

180
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,240
You have blended whiskeys.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
That's right.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,480
You can have a single malt, which is one grain in one barrel, or you can have a blend, which

183
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,280
would be different grains fermented in different barrels mixed together later.

184
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Okay.

185
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,440
So a lot of great stuff here all about wines.

186
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,480
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

187
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Hello there.

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
Welcome to Wine World.

189
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Let me know if I can help you out at all.

190
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,840
Yes, please.

191
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
I could really use some help.

192
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and I don't know what kind of wine

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
I should bring.

194
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Okay.

195
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
Do you know what kind of food will be served?

196
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
Well, his wife is Japanese.

197
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,880
He said she makes really good sushi.

198
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,000
That's a bit of a challenge.

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.

200
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,760
Well, let's see.

201
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
It'll have to be a white wine, of course.

202
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,280
Why wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

203
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,800
No, I don't think so.

204
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,000
Sushi is a very delicately flavored food and red wine would be a jarring contrast.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,320
You need a white wine which has more subtle flavors to complement the fish.

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I see.

207
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
So I should get a bottle of Chardonnay.

208
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,240
That's a white wine, right?

209
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,440
Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

210
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,800
Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites and tends to be a bit oaky.

211
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,520
I'd suggest you go for something brighter like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

212
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,280
Oh, the Sauvignon Blanc?

213
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,480
What's that?

214
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
That's another varietal or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Let's see.

216
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,520
The label says it's got attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp mineral

217
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,200
flavors and a bone-dry finish.

218
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Serve chilled.

219
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh no, how long will it take to chill the wine?

220
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm on my way to dinner now.

221
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh, it's okay.

222
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Don't worry.

223
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,480
We'll just choose a wine from the cooler.

224
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,480
We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley White would

225
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
be lovely.

226
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
All right, what varietal is that?

227
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,800
Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

228
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,400
The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,720
in the final flavor of the wine.

230
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,240
This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.

231
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,560
And you think this is a good wine?

232
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,080
Yes, this is one of our best sellers.

233
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,480
It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's

234
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,960
more approachable.

235
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
It's light and crisp with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

236
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Perfect.

237
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,600
I'll take it.

238
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,640
All right, so obviously there are a lot more varietals out there.

239
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,560
We only talked about two types of wines.

240
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,600
We had a Chardonnay and a Sauvignon Blanc.

241
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
That's right.

242
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
And the only wines we talked about were white wines.

243
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,120
Of course, there's a whole world of red wines out there.

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,800
And then between red and white, you have rosé, which are those pink wines.

245
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Those pink wines, yeah.

246
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,120
But actually, it's interesting because the culture of drinking wine is not as extensive

247
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,400
as we think it is.

248
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,160
In many parts of the world, they're not really used to drinking wine.

249
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
That's right.

250
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,920
But then you go to places like France and Italy and South America, like Argentina, Chile,

251
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,800
and you experience these different cultures of wine that are quite, I think, quite interesting

252
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,400
because they're so different.

253
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,120
And it's become even healthy to drink wine.

255
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,160
Medical tests show that if you have one glass of wine with dinner every day, it reduces

256
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
your chances of heart disease.

257
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
That's right.

258
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
There's some special ingredient.

259
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm not sure what it is, but obviously you don't want to drink too much.

260
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,320
But if you have a little bit, it's good for your heart.

261
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,840
I think red wine, they say, is good for your heart.

262
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,800
So it's interesting, but obviously, maybe in your countries, you don't drink wine or

263
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,680
maybe you have a particular type of wine.

264
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,520
Like in China, they have, isn't it plum wine or rice wine?

265
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,440
Rice wine in China and plum wine, I think, in Japan.

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,040
So maybe you have a specific type of wine that you want to let us know about.

267
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,560
And of course, if you have any questions or comments, we're always there.

Check us out at EnglishPod.com.

269
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
All right.

270
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
We'll see you again.

271
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,320
Thanks.
