00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,360
Today we're bringing you a lesson about the office, so something related to business,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
right?

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,360
That's right.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,880
And in this lesson, we're learning language you can use to tell someone they did a good

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
job.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Okay, so a job well done.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,120
You want to praise somebody.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
That's right.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,520
And we're going to listen in as a manager praises his employee on a presentation.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,120
Okay, so before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look very quickly at vocabulary

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,780
preview.

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,780
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,360
Well, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,200
And the first one is a whiz.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,280
Whiz.

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
To be a whiz.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,060
Okay, so it's an adjective.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,480
Somebody is a whiz.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
That's right.

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,800
And the whiz comes from the word wizard.

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,120
Okay, so kind of like a, like a witch, but a guy witch.

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Yeah, man witch.

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,800
But so a whiz is someone who is really good at something.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Okay, so I can say David is a computer whiz.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
Or Anthony is a math whiz.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,860
Okay, so he's really good at computers or he's really good at math or he knows a lot

30
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,860
about math.

31
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,860
Exactly.

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
Okay.

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,860
And our second word.

34
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,920
Well, we're going to hear about slides.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Slides.

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,680
PowerPoint slides.

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
PowerPoint slides.

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,800
Okay, so everyone knows PowerPoint, right?

39
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
A computer program.

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,280
A computer program that you use to make presentations.

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,000
And a slide is one page in that presentation.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,680
Okay, so if you have 10 pages in your PowerPoint presentation, you basically have 10 slides.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Exactly.

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Very good.

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,640
So now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and we're going to see what's happening

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,040
in this business meeting.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,400
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Thank you very much for your time.

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,760
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

50
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,640
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,240
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Come on, it was nothing.

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm just doing my job.

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
No, I think you deserve some recognition here.

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Well, Christian did give me a hand with the slides.

57
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,080
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,160
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,980
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

61
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,560
You made some really good points.

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Really, you did a great job.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:00,760
All right, well, it sounds like the employee is a little bit shy or embarrassed by receiving

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
all of these compliments.

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,640
Yeah, I guess he's kind of being humble about it.

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Exactly.

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
So why don't we move on to the language now?

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,200
There are so many really useful phrases in this dialogue that I think we're just going

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
to focus on those today.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,080
So let's get started with Fluency Builder.

72
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Fluency Builder.

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Okay, so today on Fluency Builder, let's start with our first phrase.

74
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,480
The boss was so impressed with the presentation that he said, I was completely blown away.

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,920
To be completely blown away.

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,680
Okay, so to be completely blown away.

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
Or to be blown away.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,480
All right, so what does that mean, to be blown away?

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,000
To be surprised and amazed, but in a very positive way.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,040
Okay, so I can say, I'm surprised, I'm amazed, but I'm still not very clear on this.

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,200
Why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use this phrase?

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,320
Example one.

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,720
Carl blew me away with his knowledge of political science.

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,360
Example two.

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,520
I was blown away when I heard that Jenny and Rick had gotten married.

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,680
They've known each other for less than a month.

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
Example three.

88
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,680
My parents were blown away when they found out I had a tattoo.

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,640
Okay, so I think that's a little bit clearer now.

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,600
And this is a wonderful way to give your praise to someone when they do something really

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
amazing.

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,680
Okay, so completely blown away.

93
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,000
You blew me away.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
Now, what about our second word?

96
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, it's quite similar.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,980
The boss said that you really wowed me.

98
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,040
You wowed me.

99
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
To wow someone.

100
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,680
Okay, so it's spelled W-O-W, wow.

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,160
So when you wow someone, you make that person go, wow.

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,120
Okay, so you impress somebody.

103
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Yep.

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
To wow someone.

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
I can use it as a verb.

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
You wowed me.

107
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
I want to wow you.

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
Well, I want you to wow me.

109
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay, so wow.

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,660
Now let's take a look at our third phrase.

111
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,440
The guy, he's a little bit shy.

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,660
He's trying to be a little bit humble about, you know, receiving so many compliments.

113
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,080
So he says, oh, it was nothing.

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
It was nothing.

115
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Really?

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
It was nothing.

117
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
It was nothing.

118
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,820
So that's a way of saying it wasn't hard or it's not a big deal.

119
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,820
It's not that important.

120
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Exactly.

121
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,720
So if somebody's saying, wow, thank you so much for lending me your car, don't worry

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
about it.

123
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
It was nothing.

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
It was nothing.

125
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
All right.

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
It's a polite way actually to respond to a nice compliment.

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Very good.

128
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,360
So before we move on to our next phrase, let's listen to a couple of examples with it was

129
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,560
nothing.

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Example one.

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
Thanks for lending me your car this week.

132
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,720
I really appreciate it.

133
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
It's okay, really.

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
It was nothing.

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,800
Example two.

136
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,840
I can't believe you organized the surprise birthday party.

137
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,200
Thank you so much.

138
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Don't worry about it.

139
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
It was nothing.

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Okay.

141
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,280
So I think that's pretty clear.

142
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,520
Now our final phrase here for fluency builder, the employee said that Kirsten gave him a

143
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
hand.

144
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Okay.

145
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,480
So to give someone a hand.

146
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Give me a hand.

147
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,080
Give me a hand.

148
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,200
Basically to help someone.

149
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Help me or assist me.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,880
So to help someone, give me a hand or let me give you a hand.

152
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
That's right.

153
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
All right.

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Very good.

155
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,360
So great phrases in fluency builder today.

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,560
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the second time.

157
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,600
We're going to slow it down a little bit so we can catch all these phrases and then we'll

158
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,600
come back.

159
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,920
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy for next year.

160
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,320
Thank you very much for your time.

161
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,680
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

163
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,000
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,920
Ah, come on.

165
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
It was nothing.

166
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm just doing my job.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
No, I think you deserve some recognition here.

168
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,880
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

169
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,680
Well, Kirsten did give me a hand with the slides.

170
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,200
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

171
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,280
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

172
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
You made some really good points.

175
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

176
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Really, you did a great job.

177
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:55,920
Okay, so like we said before, there's a lot of really helpful phrases in here.

178
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,840
And we're going to look at a few more of these in Putting It Together.

179
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,440
Putting It Together.

180
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
Okay, so let's start with the first phrase.

181
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,320
The boss was quite impressed with him and he said, that was quite the presentation.

182
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,600
That was quite the presentation.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,520
All right, quite the presentation.

184
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
So this phrase, quite the presentation, it means it was good, right?

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
It was special.

186
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,000
It was very good.

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,440
Yep, now we can take the noun presentation out and replace it with any other noun.

188
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,800
All right, so I can say, Bob is quite the basketball player.

189
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,760
Why don't we listen now for a few more examples?

190
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,360
Example one.

191
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,120
I heard you are quite the dancer.

192
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Can you teach me some moves?

193
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,000
Example two.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
Carl is quite the ladies' man.

195
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,080
He is very good when it comes to talking to girls.

196
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Example three.

197
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,360
Nancy is quite gifted at math.

198
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,740
She can solve any math problem you give her.

199
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,200
So you're saying in a very good way that something is very good.

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Or special.

201
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Very special.

202
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
All right, so the boss was very impressed with the employee and he said, and I saw that

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you took on board my feedback.

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,320
To take on board my feedback.

205
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Okay, so take on board something.

206
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,160
So here, my feedback is my suggestions, right?

207
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,640
And when you take on board my feedback, you accept my feedback and you use it.

208
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:45,040
Okay, so I can say, for example, I want you to take on board my ideas.

209
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
Or Jenny took on board a few of my suggestions.

210
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,400
I was really happy.

211
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,640
Okay, very good.

212
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,840
So to take on board, to accept and use.

213
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,040
All right, so take on board feedback, take on board suggestion, take on board ideas.

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,800
Okay, very good.

215
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,840
And we have one more phrase, I'm putting it together today.

216
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
To think something through.

217
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
To think it through.

218
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Okay, so think it through.

219
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,560
So here, the boss said that he took the time to think through my suggestions.

220
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,680
So think through, what does that mean?

221
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,680
To think carefully about all of the details of something.

222
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,520
Okay, so to take into consideration all the aspects.

223
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,280
Right, so why don't we give an example?

224
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,840
If you're thinking through a plan, right?

225
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,800
You don't just think about the end, the outcome.

226
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,280
You want to think about all of the small details, the steps in that plan.

227
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,440
Okay, so maybe I want to buy a new car, but it's a lot of money.

228
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,800
So I really have to think it through.

229
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,240
So you have to think carefully about everything that is involved in buying the new car.

230
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,360
All the money you're going to have to, you know, not spend on parties.

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
Exactly, you have to think it through.

232
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,720
You have to analyze it very carefully.

233
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
That's right.

234
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,920
So let's give a few examples of how we can use this phrase.

235
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,480
Hey, Marco, have you thought through my suggestions?

236
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,040
I can say, you guys are very young.

237
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
I think you should think it through before you get married.

238
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Good advice.

239
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,480
Okay, so to think it through.

240
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:22,920
Okay, so three great phrases and why don't we hear them one more time in our dialogue.

241
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,280
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

242
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Thank you very much for your time.

243
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,600
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

244
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,520
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

245
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,120
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

246
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,680
Come on, it was nothing.

247
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm just doing my job.

248
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,080
No, I think you deserve some recognition here.

249
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,960
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

250
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,480
Well, Christian did give me a hand with the slides.

251
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

252
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,920
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

253
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

255
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,440
You made some really good points.

256
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

257
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,640
Really, you did a great job.

258
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,560
Okay, great dialogue and some interesting phrases for giving praise, right?

259
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,000
That's, I think, very important in the workplace.

260
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,280
Yeah, and you know what, I read recently that something like six out of every ten employees

261
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,320
don't get regular praise from their boss.

262
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
It's very important.

263
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,360
And in some cultures, well, it's not very common to praise or to give positive feedback

264
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
to their employees.

265
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,200
Yeah, but I think for Western employees, actually, it's really important and it helps them work

266
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
harder the more times they hear, job well done.

267
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,760
Yeah, very good.

268
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,360
So now you have the tools that maybe you can use with your employees or...

269
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
With your friends.

270
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
With your friends.

271
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Yep.

272
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,560
