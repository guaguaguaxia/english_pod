00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Katherine and welcome everyone.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,440
Today we've got an elementary level lesson for you.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,640
It's all about sending things through the mail.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,640
That's right.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,600
So maybe gifts, maybe letters.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,100
We're going to the post office so why don't we jump right into this dialogue.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:32,780
Let's listen to it for the first time and we'll be right back.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,660
Hi I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Very well.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,860
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,860
Great.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,460
How much is this going to cost?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,460
Well it depends.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,900
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,100
What's the difference?

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,940
Well standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,740
Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about 5 to 8 working days.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,460
Express is the fastest but it's also the most expensive.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,540
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,540
I see.

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,900
Well there's no rush.

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,980
Please send it via priority mail.

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,100
Please be extra careful.

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,580
The contents of the package are fragile.

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,100
All right so pretty simple dialogue.

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,020
We want to send a package through the mail.

29
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:28,140
So why don't we take a look at some of those mail related terms in Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,260
Alright so the first item we're going to talk about in today's Language Takeaway is something

31
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,540
you can send.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,300
It's called a postcard.

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
A postcard.

34
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,860
Okay so very popular among people who are traveling and they want to send a postcard

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,860
back home.

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,860
That's right.

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,620
So a postcard is something that you usually buy at a tourist destination like Walt Disney

38
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,260
World for example.

39
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,540
And it has a picture on the front and some words on the back.

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,500
So you can write a letter on the back of this picture.

41
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,860
So it's very simple.

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,960
It's not really a letter.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,740
You don't put it in an envelope.

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,860
You just write whatever you want on the back of the postcard.

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,900
But you do have to put a stamp on it in order to send it.

46
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
That's right.

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
So stamp is our next word.

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,940
A stamp comes in different price ranges.

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,940
That means that some stamps are more expensive than other stamps.

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,580
This is like money for the mail.

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,700
So you have to buy the stamps and in order to prove that you have paid for the letter

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,660
that you want to send, you must place the stamps on the letter on the envelope or on

53
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
the postcard, right?

54
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,100
So depending on the size and weight, it costs more.

55
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,100
That's right.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,140
And usually you lick a stamp to place it on the card so it doesn't fall off.

57
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
True.

58
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
That's right.

59
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
You gotta lick it.

60
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Alright.

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,420
So as we talked about, a package can be a letter, a postcard.

62
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,380
You place stamps on it and we need to weigh the package to know how much money we have

63
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
to pay.

64
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,380
That's right.

65
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,620
So sometimes a package is very heavy if it's filled with books for example.

66
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,820
Sometimes it's very light if it's filled with clothes or feathers.

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,340
And so to find out how much something weighs, we have to weigh it.

68
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
This is a verb.

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
Okay.

70
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
So this is a verb, right?

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
To weigh.

72
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,780
So you want to know how many kilos or how many pounds this item has.

73
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Right.

74
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
So we could say, it weighs a lot or how much do you weigh?

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
Okay.

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Things like this.

77
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Very good.

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Alright.

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,140
Moving on, we have the different types of mailing speeds, I guess, right?

80
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,220
So we saw three, via priority mail, express mail or standard mail.

81
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,220
So let's go in parts.

82
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,100
Let's go with the first one, via priority mail.

83
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,980
Priority is fast.

84
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,220
It means priority is something that's important.

85
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,740
So I have many priorities at work.

86
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,440
This means they're important.

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Very important.

88
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,980
So this letter has a certain importance.

89
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,980
It's a little bit more important than for example, the other letters.

90
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
That's right.

91
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,320
But express is the most important, the fastest.

92
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,900
So something that's express is fast.

93
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,580
Like an expressway is the fast highway.

94
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Express mail.

95
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Okay.

96
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,260
So express mail is the fastest.

97
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,780
And now the normal cheapest mail is standard mail.

98
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,780
Standard.

99
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,260
So the word standard usually means the average or the normal mail.

100
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,020
And in this case, it usually takes the longest.

101
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,020
Okay.

102
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,980
So obviously standard mail is the cheapest.

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,940
Express mail is the most expensive because it's the fastest.

104
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
That's right.

105
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,220
So we've got all of those speeds.

106
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,740
Now let's listen again to today's dialogue and try and listen for the words we just talked

107
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,540
about and we'll be back in a moment to talk about some important phrases.

108
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,580
Hi, I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

109
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Very well.

110
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,740
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

111
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Great.

112
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,380
How much is this going to cost?

113
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Well it depends.

114
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,820
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

115
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
What's the difference?

116
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,860
Well, standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

117
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,700
Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.

118
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,420
Express is the fastest but it's also the most expensive.

119
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,500
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I see.

121
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,860
Well, there's no rush.

122
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,940
Please send it via priority mail.

123
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,460
Please be extra careful, the contents of the package are fragile.

124
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

125
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,460
Fluency Builder.

126
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,500
Alright, so the first phrase today is one that I like to use a lot.

127
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,980
We say, it depends.

128
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,300
How much is this going to cost?

129
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,340
Well, it depends.

130
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,020
So the phrase could be, it depends.

131
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,700
So it depends.

132
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,180
When do you usually use this?

133
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,260
Okay, if you ask me a question, I can have one answer but maybe there's another possible

134
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,540
answer.

135
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,380
For example, what are you going to wear tomorrow, Marco?

136
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,700
It depends if it rains or not.

137
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,380
Okay, it depends.

138
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,540
If it rains, I will wear a raincoat.

139
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,920
If it's sunny, I will wear a normal coat.

140
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,460
So it depends means there is a situation or a circumstance that might change and if it

141
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,100
does, my answer will change.

142
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,900
Right, so it is a conditional, it depends.

143
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,160
For example, I can ask you, what are you going to eat tonight?

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,700
It depends.

145
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,420
If I exercise, I'm going to have a hamburger and if I don't exercise, I'll have a salad.

146
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Nice, okay.

147
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,080
So it depends.

148
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,300
Now we have another phrase when they were talking about how long it's going to take

149
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,940
to mail something.

150
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,620
He said standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

151
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,020
So we have this little phrase there, up to.

152
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Up to.

153
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,820
So up to, when you hear this, these two words together, that's an indication, it's a sign

154
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,380
that we're talking about the maximum, the most.

155
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,900
Okay so tomorrow, the temperature might go up to 24 degrees Celsius.

156
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,300
Okay so the temperature maximum will reach 24.

157
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,500
It could be maybe 22, 21.

158
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
But not 25.

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Not 25.

160
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
No, because up to means the top.

161
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
So you're usually dealing with numbers, right?

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,020
For example, this coat can cost up to $150.

163
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,660
Wow, so the most I will spend is $150.

164
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,740
So sometimes you have a number like this when we're talking about sending a package.

165
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,460
We can send packages that weigh up to 10 kilos.

166
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,300
Not more than 10 kilos though.

167
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,900
Okay, very good.

168
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,020
And now for our last phrase to close off the dialogue, the guy said, well you know what,

169
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
there's no rush.

170
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
No rush.

171
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
There's no rush.

172
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,180
Okay, well the first word we want to look at here is the word rush.

173
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,740
In this case, we're talking about sending a package and the postcard, right?

174
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,780
So does this person want it to arrive fast?

175
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
He says no.

176
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,420
No, there's no rush.

177
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,540
Let's send it standard.

178
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
It's cheaper.

179
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,180
Okay, so maybe your friend is like, come on, we're going to be late.

180
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,740
And you're like, no, there's no rush.

181
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,060
We have one hour before the movie starts.

182
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
Calm down.

183
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,940
Okay, so you're not in a hurry.

184
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,580
No, there's no rush.

185
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Slow down.

186
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,900
It's okay.

187
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,340
This is a good one to talk about with friends or if you're working on a project at work.

188
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,300
You say, listen, there's no rush.

189
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Take your time.

190
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,940
Okay, very good.

191
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,580
So let's go back to our dialogue.

192
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:47,860
Let's listen to it for the very last time and we'll be back in a bit.

193
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,420
Hi, I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

194
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Very well.

195
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,620
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

196
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
Great.

197
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,700
How much is this going to cost?

198
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Well, it depends.

199
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,660
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

200
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
What's the difference?

201
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,700
Well, standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

202
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,540
Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.

203
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,260
Express is the fastest, but it's also the most expensive.

204
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,340
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

205
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
I see.

206
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,700
Well, there's no rush.

207
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,780
Please send it via priority mail.

208
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,900
Please be extra careful.

209
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,940
The contents of the package are fragile.

210
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,660
All right, we're back.

211
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,380
So now, Catherine, do you usually send postcards when you are abroad, when you travel?

212
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,900
Yes, I love postcards.

213
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,260
And actually, I have some friends who have an amazing postcard collection.

214
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,300
Oh, really?

215
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,740
But it's not normal postcards.

216
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,220
They find the most ugly postcards and they buy them and they write silly notes and they

217
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,420
send them to themselves.

218
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
Oh, really?

219
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,100
I have the tradition of always sending my parents and my grandparents a postcard when

220
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm abroad.

221
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
That's so sweet.

222
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,300
They have a collection of all the places you've been.

223
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,220
So all the time, wherever I am, the first thing that I try to do if I'm in a cool place,

225
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,300
I send them a postcard.

226
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,940
And sometimes if I'm in a country in various cities and there are some nice things in,

227
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,700
for example, two or three cities, I'll send them three postcards.

228
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
That's awesome.

229
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,100
So do they have a book at home with all of these postcards?

230
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Yeah, they do.

231
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,060
So I just send them a little thing, how I'm doing and how great it is and wish you could

232
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,580
be here, little notes.

233
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,920
And then they have all the collection.

234
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,900
It's really cool because that way I've actually kept track a little bit of what year and what

235
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,420
date I was in certain places.

236
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Wow.

237
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,860
Well, it's also nice because postcards, you don't need to write a very long note.

238
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
There's no space.

239
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
You just write a short note.

240
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,580
You say, hi, how's the weather?

241
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Miss you.

242
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Wish you were here.

243
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Right.

244
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Okay.

245
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,980
So that's all the time we have for today.

246
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,420
But let us know if you've had any inconveniences at the post office.

247
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,060
I actually had one once.

248
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,460
I couldn't send batteries through the mail because they have acid apparently.

249
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Oh, yeah.

250
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,540
It's very difficult to send.

251
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,620
So maybe you've had a situation like this before.

252
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,620
Let us know, EnglishPod.com.

253
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
We'll see you guys there.

254
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,620
Bye, everyone.

255
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:36,800
Hey, you can, too.
