00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,840
And we're bringing you the third part of our suspense series of New Guy in Town.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
That's right.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,840
What's going to happen today?

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Well, I don't know.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,880
There's still so many things that could happen.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,280
This guy is kind of weird, right?

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,040
Oh, is he a vampire?

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Like what's going on?

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,460
Yeah, and I would like to thank all of our listeners for contributing and sending out

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,160
their ideas of what they think happens in this third part.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,040
Yeah, I especially like the story about the rabbit.

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,040
Yeah, the rabbit.

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
That was a good one.

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Yeah.

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
As promised, we took the idea of one of our listeners and created a dialogue around it.

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
Yes.

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,600
And this time it was a contribution of Babar Dawan.

21
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,160
Yeah, he gave us a great idea for this dialogue.

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Exactly.

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
He gave us a really good idea.

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,360
So thank you, Babar.

25
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,840
And this one is for you.

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,040
In this dialogue, we're going to be looking at some hospitality vocabulary.

27
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,720
Yeah, some phrases you can use when you welcome someone to your house.

28
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
All right.

29
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,960
So we've got some language to preview.

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,560
So let's turn now to vocabulary preview.

31
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,080
Vocabulary preview.

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,440
On vocabulary preview, we have the word appetite.

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Appetite.

34
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Appetite.

35
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Appetite.

36
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,860
So, Erika, tell us about appetite.

37
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,000
When you have an appetite, you're hungry or you have a desire to eat food, right?

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All right.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,760
So you can have a big appetite, a small appetite.

40
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,080
Really hungry, a little bit hungry.

41
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Okay.

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Let's look at our next word.

43
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Poison.

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Poison.

45
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Poison.

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Poison.

47
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,760
So poison could be a noun or a verb.

48
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Exactly.

49
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,280
So when you poison someone, you put something in their food or maybe in their drink that

50
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,680
makes them really sick and maybe even makes them die.

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay.

52
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
So to poison somebody.

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Yeah.

54
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,280
And the noun is actually the thing that you put inside the food or drink.

55
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,440
So usually poison is some sort of chemical substance.

56
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Yes.

57
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,080
Snakes, for example, have poison.

58
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,320
Yeah, in their teeth.

59
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Right.

60
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
So if you get bitten by a snake, you'll get poisoned.

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
You'll get poisoned.

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
All right.

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
So let's take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see why we are talking about

64
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:21,040
poison and we'll come back and explain some great words.

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,440
Please make yourselves at home.

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,920
Let me take your coats.

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Dinner's almost ready.

68
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
I hope you brought your appetite.

69
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Your house is lovely, Armand.

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
Very interesting decor.

71
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,080
Very gothic.

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
I think it's amazing.

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,360
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

75
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,920
Maybe you could give me a few pointers.

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
It would be my pleasure.

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
Please have a seat.

78
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

79
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,840
We would love some.

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Here you are.

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,760
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,480
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
It's delicious.

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,240
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

85
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,120
Almost tastes like... like...

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Ellen?

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Ellen!

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,800
Are you okay?

89
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Did she pass out?

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Yeah.

91
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,320
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

92
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,800
You'll ruin our meal.

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Okay, so that was unexpected.

94
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I know.

95
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Lois, can you believe it?

96
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Apparently, Lois is helping Armand.

97
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I know.

98
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Maybe she's a vampire.

99
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
All right, well, I really wonder what's going to happen next.

100
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,880
We'll see what happens next.

101
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,280
But now, let's take a look at some of the language in Language Takeaway.

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Language Takeaway All right, so we have a couple of words in

103
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,680
Language Takeaway today.

104
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,280
Let's start off with pointers.

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
Pointers.

106
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
Pointers.

107
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,200
So to give somebody pointers...

108
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
You give them some suggestions.

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Suggestions or tips.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Exactly.

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,840
So, suggestions or tips.

112
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,800
Let's listen to some examples of how you would use it.

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
Example one.

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,820
I want to dance salsa better.

115
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,320
Can you give me a few pointers?

116
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,560
Example two.

117
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,360
I need some pointers on how to be a better manager.

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,600
Example three.

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
Let me give you a few pointers so you can pass your exam.

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
All right, so pointers.

121
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,440
It's clear now.

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Let's take a look at our next word.

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Aroma.

124
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Aroma.

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Aroma.

126
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Aroma.

127
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,600
This is a nice round word, isn't it?

128
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Yeah, aroma.

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Yeah.

130
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Well, this word makes you sound really educated.

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Basically, it means...

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Smell.

134
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Smell.

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Yep.

136
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,760
So, for example, this coffee has a great aroma.

137
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,560
Or maybe this perfume has the aroma of roses and lavender.

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Nice.

139
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Okay.

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Let's take a look at our next word.

141
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Bitter.

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Bitter.

143
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Bitter.

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
B-I-T-T-E-R.

145
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Bitter.

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Okay, bitter.

147
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,000
So, bitter is the opposite of...

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sweet.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Of sweet.

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,200
So, it's always hard to describe taste, isn't it?

151
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Yeah.

152
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,840
But maybe we can say a few foods that are bitter.

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Okay.

154
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,800
So, chocolate, when it has no sugar, is bitter.

155
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay.

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,080
Or, for example, coffee without any sugar is also bitter.

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Yeah.

158
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,400
And sometimes red wine can be quite bitter.

159
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Mm-hmm.

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
So, bitter.

161
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,680
Okay, and now let's take a look at our last word.

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Pass out.

163
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Pass out.

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Pass out.

165
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Pass out.

166
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
It seems kind of easy.

167
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Pass and out.

168
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Yep.

169
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
But it means something different.

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,240
Yeah, when you put them together.

171
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
What does it mean?

172
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,920
It means faint or become unconscious.

173
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay.

174
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,640
So, imagine someone, you know, they're standing up and then suddenly they start to move around

175
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,400
and then fall over to the ground.

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
Okay, pass out.

177
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Yes.

178
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,440
This usually happens when you get really, really drunk.

179
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,280
Sometimes also when maybe you're pregnant, you might pass out.

180
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Right.

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,640
Okay, to lose consciousness.

182
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Yes.

183
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,400
Marco and I have a couple of examples of this word for you.

184
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,440
Example 1.

185
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:50,840
I drank so much last night that I passed out at my friend's house.

186
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,440
Example 2.

187
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,880
She was standing in the sun too long, so she passed out right in front of me.

188
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,400
Example 3.

189
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,000
My sister passes out whenever she sees blood.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,400
Alright, so let's listen to our dialogue again now.

191
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,160
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

192
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,640
And you'll be able to hear these words that we just talked about.

193
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,440
Please make yourselves at home.

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,960
Let me take your coats.

195
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,680
Dinner is almost ready.

196
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,560
I hope you brought your appetite.

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,000
Your house is lovely, Armand.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,440
Very interesting decor.

199
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Very gothic.

200
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,160
I think it's amazing.

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
You have such good taste, Armand.

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

203
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,560
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

204
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,480
It would be my pleasure.

205
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
Please have a seat.

206
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

207
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,680
We would love some.

208
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,400
Here you are, a very special Merlot brought directly from my home country.

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,840
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and superior flavor.

210
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,800
Mmm, it's delicious.

211
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

212
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
Almost tastes like... like...

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Ellen!

214
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Ellen!

215
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,880
Are you okay?

216
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,280
Did she pass out?

217
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Yeah.

218
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,200
I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much.

219
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,400
You'll ruin our meal.

220
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Alright, so interesting story.

221
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Yes.

222
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,840
We have some great phrases that we've used here, so let's take a look at them in Fluency

223
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,960
Builder.

224
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,200
Fluency Builder.

225
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,080
We've got four phrases for you that are great to use when you want to welcome someone into

226
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,400
your house or into your office or anywhere, really.

227
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Exactly.

228
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,240
So, why don't we take a look at the first one?

229
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,880
Please make yourselves at home.

230
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,960
Please make yourselves at home.

231
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
Please make yourselves at home.

232
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,960
So this is a very common phrase when you invite somebody to your house.

233
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Yeah.

234
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
You always use this phrase.

235
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Yeah.

236
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,560
It's like, make yourself comfortable, relax, sit down.

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,280
Yeah, don't worry about it.

238
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,360
Like, my house is your house.

239
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Exactly.

240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
Make yourself at home.

241
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,840
Okay, good one.

242
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,160
Usually people arrive to a party or to a dinner with jackets, coats, scarves, all that stuff.

243
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,880
So this next phrase is really handy.

244
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,040
Let me take your coats.

245
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,520
Let me take your coats.

246
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,960
Let me take your coats.

247
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,440
So that means, give me your coats and I'll put them in the closet.

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Right.

249
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,400
Let me take your coats.

250
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,240
And then, a good host would always offer a drink, right?

251
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Exactly.

252
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,520
Or in this case, wine.

253
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,640
So they would say, can I offer you a glass of wine?

254
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,960
Or sometimes you could say, can I offer you a glass, can I offer you something to drink?

255
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Yeah.

256
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,020
So, can I offer you a glass of wine?

257
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,580
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

258
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,760
You offer me a glass of wine, I say, yeah, sure, I'll take a glass of wine.

259
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
All right.

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,720
And then I would use our next phrase.

261
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Here you are.

262
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Here you are.

263
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Here you are.

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Exactly.

265
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
So, it's not saying, you are here.

266
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
No.

267
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,600
It's saying to someone, here it is, take it.

268
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Yes, yes.

269
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Right.

270
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
You know what?

271
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
This is a really, really great phrase.

272
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,920
A lot of people who are learning English don't say this, but it's really common, really

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
natural.

274
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,200
And if you use it, you'll sound really great.

275
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Here you are.

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Exactly.

277
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Here you are.

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
And you can use this anytime you give someone something.

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Right.

280
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,240
So, if you give somebody a pen or a pencil, a notebook, here you are.

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Here it is.

282
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Yep.

283
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Okay.

284
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Great words.

285
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one more time and then we'll come back.

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:15,160
Please, make yourselves at home.

287
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,600
Let me take your coats.

288
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Dinner's almost ready.

289
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,680
I hope you brought your appetite.

290
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,640
Your house is lovely, Armand.

291
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
Very interesting decor.

292
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,800
Very gothic.

293
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I think it's amazing.

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

295
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

296
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,640
Maybe you could give me a few pointers.

297
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,800
It would be my pleasure.

298
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Please have a seat.

299
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

300
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,600
We would love some.

301
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Here you are.

302
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,480
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

303
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:01,200
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

304
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
It's delicious.

305
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,960
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

306
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,240
Almost tastes like...

307
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Ellen?

308
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Ellen!

309
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,520
Are you okay?

310
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Did she pass out?

311
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,560
Yeah.

312
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,080
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

313
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
You'll ruin our meal.

314
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:34,560
Okay, so Armand is a pretty good host.

315
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,600
He offered them a Merlot.

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,360
Yeah, which is a type of wine.

317
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
A type of wine.

318
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,600
And this is really interesting because there are many types of wines.

319
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Do you know any?

320
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I know a lot.

321
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
All right, so give us some pointers here.

322
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,280
Right, Merlot is probably like the most common red wine, right?

323
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,680
And Merlot is actually the grape variety.

324
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
The grape variety.

325
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,240
Varietal, as it's called in winespeak.

326
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,520
Wow, varietal.

327
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Yeah.

328
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Well, right now I'm really liking to drink Tempranillo, which is a Spanish wine.

329
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Tempranillo?

330
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Yeah.

331
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Really?

332
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
And is that also the type of grape?

333
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Yes.

334
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Oh, nice.

335
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,120
Usually we would say red wine or white wine, right?

336
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,200
But the varieties, depending on the grapes, is what gives them their names.

337
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,240
So we also have a couple of other, like maybe you have a Chardonnay.

338
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
White wine.

339
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
White wine.

340
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
You have a Cabernet Sauvignon.

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Red wine.

342
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Red wine again.

343
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
And my personal favorite is a Carbonaire.

344
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh yeah, that's a nice one.

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's a nice one.

346
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,160
And it's not very common anymore.

347
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,500
Apparently the grape isn't growing very well in France anymore or in Spain.

348
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,360
So from what I understand, it's only in Chile and Argentina.

349
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
But it's a really good one.

350
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,760
Actually, Argentina makes really good Carbonaires.

351
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,520
But you know who else makes good wine?

352
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Who?

353
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Canadians.

354
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Really?

355
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Yes.

356
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Canadian wine.

357
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Yeah.

358
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,200
You almost never find it outside of Canada, but there is one region in the western part

359
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,760
of the country that makes really, really good wines, especially some nice Pinot Noirs and

360
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,560
some good white wines.

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Okanagan Valley.

362
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Check it out.

363
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Nice.

364
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Yeah.

365
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
All right.

366
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Well, what about in your countries?

367
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,760
Do you produce any wine or maybe any other type of drink?

368
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Yes.

369
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Right?

370
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,720
Many countries have their own types of drinks, so we want to know about it.

371
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Tell us.
