00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco. My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson about education and university.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right. Today we're trying to find a university. We want to get some information about how much it costs and all that sort of stuff.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, why don't we jump into the dialogue and see what's going on today.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
AmLion College

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've never heard of AmLion College. Could you?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Of course, sir. Let me give you a brief overview.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
AmLion College is located in the center of New York City. The school covers a wide range of academic subjects and 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And last year AmLion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Interesting. And what about the tuition fees, then?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 per semester.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay. Well...

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And did I mention our on-campus housing? Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 per month.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sounds good. Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir! Sir!

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, we're back. So now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Language Takeaway

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, first up, Marco, we've got this word, transferable.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In the dialogue, the representative from AmLion College said that 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so before we talk about transferable, what is the difference here? We have two words, college and university.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So why is he saying that you can transfer your courses from AmLion College to another university?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, college and university are words that we use in English to describe higher education.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That means education after high school.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And a college is usually just for people who are in the middle of their studies.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A college is usually just for bachelor's students, students who are doing their first four years out of high school.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But a university is usually a larger institution that has bachelor's degree students as well as master's degree students and PhD candidates.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so while a college is for 18 to 22 year olds, a university can have students of all ages who are doing sometimes very advanced degrees like postdoctoral work.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, very interesting. And so this is why the person mentions that 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So transferable means that you can transfer, you can move to another university.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So everything that you've studied, you can take with you.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right. So a lot of people like to start at a college or vice versa.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They just start at a big university and transfer to a college.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And so it's important to know that your courses can be transferred as well.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So if I studied Spanish for two years, I can transfer that, I can transfer those courses to my new school.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right, so you don't have to start over.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, very good.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And well, obviously, one of the big questions when you're picking a university is the tuition fee.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So tuition is the amount of money it costs to attend a university for usually a year.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tuition fees is the actual money you have to pay.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So you can say, I can't afford my tuition fees this year, so I will be getting a part time job.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay. And so this is what tuition fees are.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In school, you call it tuition.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't say how much it costs.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You ask, what is the tuition?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's the tuition exactly?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay. And he mentioned that it was around $15,000 per semester.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So this is interesting. Is this the year?

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, a semester is half of an academic year.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All right. So an academic year is usually September to May or June.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And a semester is half of that.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So first semester or fall semester is the study period between September and December or January.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right. Okay.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So basically what we could deduce is that this university costs $15,000 per semester or about $30,000 per year.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's right.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, very good.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And well, he also mentioned about the on-campus housing.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right. So on-campus is pretty straightforward.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It means that this housing option where you live and sleep is on the campus.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And a university campus is not one building.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's many, many buildings together.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sometimes there are classrooms and there are laboratories and there's a cafeteria.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But there's also housing.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And most housing comes in one style.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What's the style they mentioned in today's dialogue?

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A dorm. This is where university students usually live if they live on campus.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They have dorms.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So dorm is short for dormitory.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And it basically means that it's an apartment building for students or even sometimes workers that's very close to where they'll be studying or working.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So what is the difference between a dorm and an apartment?

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, I can give you an example.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Some dorms are very fancy, but my dorm at university was very simple.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So I lived in one bedroom with another girl.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There were two beds and no bathroom.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And so everyone on that floor of the building shared bathrooms.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And the bathrooms were, you know, there's six showers and four toilets or whatever.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, very good.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, I think this is the main thing with a dorm is usually you don't have a kitchen.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You don't have usually your own bathroom.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And so it's just basically a room and a bedroom.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And then you share everything else with other people.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All right, very good.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A lot of great things related to college.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think this is very good vocab for you, especially if you're considering going to college or something like that.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Especially if you're considering going to college or maybe you want to continue your study.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So why don't we go back.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's listen to this dialogue again.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've never heard of AmLion College.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Could you?

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course, sir.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me give you a brief overview.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
AmLion College is located in the center of New York City.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And last year, AmLion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Interesting.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And what about the tuition fees then?

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 per semester.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And did I mention our on-campus housing?

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 per month.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sounds good.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sir, you got the wrong flyer.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sir.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Sir.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
All right.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're back.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So now let's take a look at these three phrases we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fluency Builder

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So again, when the person who was speaking for this college was describing it,

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
they said that the school covers a wide range of academic subjects.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Now this phrase, wide range, is something you'll hear in a lot of different contexts.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What does it mean, Marco?

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It means that they have a variety, a very big variety of subjects.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So they don't only focus, for example, on business.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They may have arts, they may have engineering, business, etc.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So if you're studying at a university and they offer one course, they offer English,

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is that a wide range of subjects?

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, no, that's not a wide range.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So basically, a wide range of subjects would be that you can have many, many, many choices.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, after that, we also had a great phrase when we were discussing tuition fees.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So the visitor asked, what about the tuition fees?

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And the answer was, you'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now, you'll be looking at is a very, very strange phrase, right?

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, it's not strange, but it might sound strange to non-native English speakers.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Right.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's actually a very common phrase, especially when you're talking to salesmen.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They don't want to say, you'll have to pay or you have to pay or anything like this.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They'll say, well, you'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And that means you are expected to pay this amount of money.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But they don't really say pay.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So this is the key thing.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
All right.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So this is the price.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is the price tag.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And this is something that, like you're saying, salespeople say so that you don't have to say,

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
well, the price of this is $30,000.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So another good context for this phrase would be like a car dealership.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If I'm buying a car and I see a beautiful new Ford Mustang and I say, well, how much does this cost?

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What would you, as the car dealer, say?

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll say, well, you'll be looking at around $30,000.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's right.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So this is a way of saying you'll have to pay.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And, well, the guy wasn't really convinced.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think it was kind of expensive because dorms were also $3,000 per month.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So he was like, well, sounds good.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So this phrase, sounds good, is something that English speakers use all the time.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I personally use it very, very often.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And it's another way of saying okay.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So if you agree with someone, you say sounds good.

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So should we meet at 7 for the movie tonight?

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, sure.

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Sounds good.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
All right.

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's another way of saying yes, good, okay, very well.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So sounds good.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Great stuff.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why don't we take a break?

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's listen to everything one more time, and we'll be back in a bit.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I've never heard of AmLion College.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Could you?

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Of course, sir.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let me give you a brief overview.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
AmLion College is located in the center of New York City.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects,

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And last year, AmLion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Interesting.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And what about the tuition fees, then?

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 per semester.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well...

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And did I mention our on-campus housing?

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 per month.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sounds good.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sir, you got the wrong flyer.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Sir!

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sir!

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
All right, so universities in the United States, they have a very...

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They have a...

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They're infamous for being very expensive.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And so we discussed the difference between colleges and universities,

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
but I think it's important to also talk about the difference between public and private schools.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Public schools are schools that are paid for by the government or that are subsidized,

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
so the government pays part of them.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And these are schools that tend to be cheaper than private schools.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So private schools can be as much as $50,000 for one year of study.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, for example, the famous ones like Harvard or Stanford, those are private schools.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Those are private schools, but the University of California is a public institution.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The University of Illinois, for example, is another public institution.

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So there are many different options in the United States.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think usually the state universities have the name of the state in them.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So University of Florida is probably state university.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's right, but you have to be careful because the University of Pennsylvania is a private university.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, really?

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, it's an Ivy League school, so it's one of the oldest schools in America,

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and it's like Harvard or Yale. It's very, very high quality.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is something that they always mention when talking about universities in the States.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They always say it's an Ivy League school, just like you said right now.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What does it mean if a university is Ivy League?

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, a league is just a group, right?

213
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And so some of the first universities in the United States formed this group called the Ivy League,

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and I think it used to have to do with the sports.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
These teams would play each other in sports, but I could be wrong.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But anyway, in the 18th century, these were schools for men,

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and there were seven Ivy League schools for men, and then there were the sister schools for women.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Wellesley, Radcliffe, these are the sister schools.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And so nowadays, both men and women can go to all these universities,

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and so we just talk about them as the Ivy Leagues.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And the Ivy League schools that are most famous are Harvard, Yale, Brown,

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, things like that.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So talking about universities and colleges, I have heard also the community college.

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, that can be a lot more affordable.

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's something that's, because it's a community college, it's usually something you go to back near your home.

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because colleges and universities, sometimes people travel very, very far to go to these schools.

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But community colleges are available to people in your own community, and you can take night classes.

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can do a lot of different things at them.

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're great resources. They're a lot more affordable than other schools.

230
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And a lot of people like to go to them because they don't have to pay these expensive fees for housing like dorms or for travel.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And they're a great option for people.

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So community colleges, colleges, and universities are the major distinctions.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There is a lot to talk about on this subject, especially if you're a student or you're a professional,

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
considering doing a master's abroad or you want to go to the States or Canada to study.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There's a lot of things to take into consideration.

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So this is a great topic. We really want to hear from you if you have any other questions or doubts.
