00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,200
My name is Catherine and we have a delicious Italian food lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
That's right.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,000
We are at an Italian restaurant and we are ordering food.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,360
So this is going to be very helpful next time you are at an Italian restaurant with your

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,720
friends and you're ordering up some dishes.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,440
Let's take a listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,440
on.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:35,440
Good evening ladies.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,360
My name is Josh and I'll be your server tonight.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,320
May I take your order?

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,840
Do you have any recommendations?

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,560
But the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,920
I'd like to have the grilled chicken.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,160
But can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,400
Of course, ma'am.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
And for you?

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,400
I'll have the horse tripe.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,680
All right, we're back and now let's take a look at all those delicious Italian dishes

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,240
on Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,840
So first of all, we have two different kinds of sauce really.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,280
The first is cream mushroom.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,480
So what's a cream sauce, Marco?

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
A cream mushroom sauce.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,160
So basically, this is cream from milk and you have mushrooms in it.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
And I don't know, I think everyone has seen it.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,320
It's a very thick white sauce.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,640
It has little slices of mushrooms in it.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,200
It's kind of sweet.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
That's right.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,640
And so oftentimes you see there's a lot of cream in it.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,400
And so oftentimes you see there's cream sauces, which are white, and tomato sauces, which

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
are red.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,440
And this here is a cream sauce, so it's white and it's got chunks of mushroom in it.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
Very tasty.

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,320
And the waiter also offered prawn with the pasta.

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
So what is a prawn?

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Prawn fettuccine.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,560
So prawn is like a big, it's like a word for shrimp.

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,120
I always think of jumbo prawns, which are these big, big, big shrimps.

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,520
So they're basically the same thing.

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
Shrimp and prawn are basically the same.

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
That's right.

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,240
And they're a seafood that when they get cooked, they curl.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,040
So they look like a circle, but they're pinkish or red.

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
That's right.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
They're very tasty.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,440
Okay, so now let's take a look at the different types of pasta.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,840
So we have three different types of pasta that the waiter suggested.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,480
So the first one is...

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,160
Okay, we're going to say all three in the American way, but I'm going to tell you the

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
Italian way is quite different.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,080
So I'll say that afterwards.

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,440
The first is penne.

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Okay.

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
So this is a type of pasta.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,520
What does it look like?

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,720
It is like a small tube.

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,240
So maybe three centimeters long, and it is round and it has a hole in the middle.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,200
And so it's a kind of pasta.

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,160
And what about the fettuccine?

64
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,320
So fettuccine is a long noodle, but it's flat.

65
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
It's not round, it's flat.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Fettuccine.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,040
So it kind of looks like a shoelace.

68
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,960
Yeah, it's long and flat.

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,600
And then we have spaghetti, which I think many people know, and this is probably the

70
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
most popular one.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Spaghetti is very long, just like fettuccine, but it's very, very thin and round.

73
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,400
So it kind of looks like maybe a pencil, a very long pencil.

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120
But very thin, more like hair, actually.

75
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,480
And there are thin kinds, so they have a special name.

76
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,960
But this is just a normal pasta that you will see everywhere.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,480
It's very long and you can twirl it.

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
You can spin it around your fork.

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
Okay, so that's what we have.

80
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
We have penne, fettuccine, and spaghetti.

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,880
Now, the other woman ended up ordering horse tripe.

82
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,000
Now this is also another Italian dish.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What is this exactly?

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,720
Well, horse is the animal, so this is tripe that comes from a horse.

85
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,400
But tripe is a certain part of the animal that we, it's a food name actually.

86
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,600
So when we eat the stomach lining, the part of the stomach that goes around the stomach,

87
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,200
it's kind of squishy, soft.

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
That is called tripe.

89
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,560
And you can have tripe from many different animals, like cows or pigs.

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,120
But in this case, it's horse tripe.

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,120
So it's basically that thick piece of like spongy material around the animal's stomach.

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
When you cook it, it looks very funny.

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,800
So this is actually a famous Italian dish as well, right?

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I think so.

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,040
I think they eat it in the South more, but you can definitely get tripe in a lot of different

96
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
places in Italy.

97
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,520
Okay, very good.

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
So there you have it.

99
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,120
A lot of different dishes, Italian dishes.

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
We've taken a look at a couple of pasta dishes.

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,720
Why don't we take a break, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,120
Good evening, ladies.

103
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,840
My name is Josh and I'll be your server tonight.

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
May I take your order?

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Do you have any recommendations?

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,560
Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine

107
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,000
is also very nice.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,600
I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Of course, ma'am.

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,840
And for you?

111
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:42,680
I'll have the horse tripe.

112
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
All right, we're back.

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,720
So now we're going to give you three key phrases from Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,360
Fluency Builder.

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,320
So the phrases we have selected for you today are phrases that you are sure to hear anytime

116
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,360
you go to a restaurant in America or any other English speaking country.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
Basically, you have a waiter who comes to you if you sit down and this is what they'll

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
say.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,680
The first thing they'll say is, I'll be your server.

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
I'll be your server tonight.

121
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,040
So he introduces himself.

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
He says, good evening, ladies.

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,520
My name is Josh and I'll be your server tonight.

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,920
So when he's saying, I'll be your server, it's another way of saying, I'll be your waiter.

125
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Your waiter, that's right.

126
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
But server can be a man or a woman.

127
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,640
And a waiter can only be a man.

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,200
If it's a woman, it's a waitress.

129
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay.

130
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,280
So waitress for a woman, waiter for a guy.

131
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,480
But if you use server, it's for men and women.

132
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes, I'll be your server.

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,640
And I just like to remind you that this is more common in America because in America,

134
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,600
waiters and waitresses or servers, they have to earn tips and so they're very nice.

135
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Aha.

136
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Okay.

137
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,720
So this is why they introduce themselves.

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,080
They are very nice to you.

139
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
And then they ask, may I take your order?

140
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
May I take your order?

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
So the verb to take here doesn't mean to take it from you.

142
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,640
It means to ask you and then they'll write it down.

143
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Okay.

144
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,520
So the server will ask you what you want to order and then we'll write it down.

145
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,540
And the order is what you have decided to eat.

146
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,520
So that's the food that you order.

147
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,360
Now this next phrase is very, very handy, especially if you're in a country that maybe

148
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,240
you don't know the dishes well or if you're in a restaurant that you want to see what

149
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,860
they recommend.

150
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,720
You can just say, do you have any recommendations?

151
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,360
Do you have any recommendations?

152
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Okay.

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,300
So this is a way to ask the server what's good.

154
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,680
So what he thinks is good or what the restaurant serves very well.

155
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Okay.

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,120
So you could say, I've never been to this restaurant before.

157
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,360
Do you have any recommendations?

158
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,980
Or maybe even, you know, Marco, we're having dinner and I know that you really like Italian

159
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,400
food and I don't know much about Italian food.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,320
So I can ask you, do you have any recommendations?

161
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Okay.

162
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,120
So this is a way of asking what is good here.

163
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,960
What is delicious in this restaurant?

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
What's good to eat.

165
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Okay.

166
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
All right.

167
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
So three phrases there for you.

168
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
Why don't we take another short break and let's listen to the dialogue for the last

169
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:15,000
time.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,840
Good evening, ladies.

171
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,720
My name is Josh and I'll be your server tonight.

172
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,680
May I take your order?

173
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
Do you have any recommendations?

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:32,440
Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,920
is also very nice.

176
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,520
I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

177
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,720
Of course, ma'am.

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
And for you?

179
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
I, uh, I'll have the horse tripe.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,160
All right.

181
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,000
So talking about pasta.

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,240
Now one thing before you mentioned that all these different types of pasta, they're basically

183
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
the same thing.

184
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,000
They're just different shapes, right?

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,160
That's how you distinguish them.

186
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,480
Well, yeah, they're, they're basically made from the same ingredients.

187
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,880
And so you have, most of them are kind of a yellow color, but sometimes you have pastas

188
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,160
that are a dark, like a brown or a green that depends on what kind of things you put into

189
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
the dough.

190
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,120
But generally they're the same ingredients, but they are different shapes.

191
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
Like they have curly ones and they have long ones and short ones.

192
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
All right.

193
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,560
So how do you pronounce, uh, we said penne in, uh, in English, in American English, but

194
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,520
in proper Italian, it would be penne.

195
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,600
So you, you, you double pronounce the consonant.

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
What about fettuccine?

197
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Fettuccine.

198
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Oh, it's fettuccine.

199
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Fettuccine.

200
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Um, in, in American, we say, uh, fettuccine.

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Fettuccine.

202
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,240
Like fettuccine Alfredo is a very common American Italian dish, but in Italian it'd

203
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
be fettuccine.

204
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,960
So you might hear it differently.

205
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
And what about spaghetti?

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Spaghetti.

207
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Spaghetti.

208
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
Oh, you pronounce the double T as well.

209
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
That's right.

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Okay.

211
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,320
So, uh, you said that, uh, obviously there are a lot of other types of pasta.

212
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,360
What about this pasta that's, uh, I think it's made of spinach.

213
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
It's green.

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,440
Yeah, that's, uh, that's just a spinach pasta.

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Oh, okay.

216
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,040
So they put the spinach in the dough.

217
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Um, but you can also find very many, um, shapes like the angel hair pasta is very popular.

218
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
It's very thin.

219
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,440
That's the one I was saying is it's almost like hair.

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
It's so thin.

221
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,800
It's very, it's long as well.

222
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,960
What about those little curly tubes?

223
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,000
Um, you, they look like penne, but they're kind of curved.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,320
They look like little, uh, ends or you have, um, macaroni, macaroni, elbow macaroni.

225
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,920
We call them in America and they look like your elbow on your arm.

226
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,720
So we call them elbow macaroni.

227
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,520
What about the ones that are, um, they have like a spiral, they kind of look like springs.

228
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Those are called fusilli.

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Fusilli.

230
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Uh huh.

231
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah.

232
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
And you also have one that's very special.

233
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
This is my favorite pasta, by the way.

234
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
It's called orecchiette.

235
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Oh, what is this?

236
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Orecchiette.

237
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,720
And they look like your ear.

238
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,000
And that's what that means in Italian.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It means your little ear.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, really?

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So ear pastas.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Wow.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And what about ravioli?

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,120
This is probably one of the most, uh, famous, uh, dishes.

246
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Ravioli.

247
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
What, what is this?

248
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,840
A ravioli is like a square.

249
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,440
It's like a square pasta.

250
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
But it's more like a pocket or a pillow.

251
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,040
And inside you have ingredients like meat or cheese usually is very popular.

252
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Right.

253
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
So you have this cheese inside this little, this little packet.

254
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
This little, yeah.

255
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
This little dough.

256
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,720
It's very soft and very warm.

257
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,400
And then on top sometimes people like to put butter or tomato sauce.

258
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Okay.

259
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
It's really delicious.

260
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,440
So that's the main difference, like, this was obviously, all the pastas that we mentioned,

261
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,360
they're just, uh, they don't have anything inside them.

262
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
No, they're just dough.

263
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,280
And a ravioli is a special kind of pasta that's like a, it's almost like a dumpling in a way.

264
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
It's, it's stuffed.

265
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
It has something inside.

266
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
It has things inside.

267
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
All right.

268
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Really interesting.

269
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,520
I think Italian cuisine is among one of the most famous foods in the world.

270
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,920
