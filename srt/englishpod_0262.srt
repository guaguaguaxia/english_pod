00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,700
My name is Catherine and if you've been following along with us recently, you'll know that we

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,000
have a series about interviewing in English.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,900
And so today we have the very last episode of that series.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,900
That's right.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,920
Today is the last part of our interview series and we're basically just saying goodbye and

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,320
we're doing some other things when you're leaving an interview.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,340
It's very important the things that you say.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,920
That's right because this is the last thing that you're going to do in the interview so

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,840
it's what your interviewer will remember.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,880
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,280
Well Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,220
I don't think so Mr. Parsons.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,800
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Okay, well listen.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
Here's my business card with my mobile number.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
Of course you can also call Ms. Childs too.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Great.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,200
When can I expect to hear from you?

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,880
Well we are finishing the short list interviews tomorrow so we will certainly have a decision

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,120
made by early next week.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,360
Ms. Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
How does that sound?

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
That sounds perfect.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,380
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr. Parsons.

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,520
The pleasure is all mine Rebecca.

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
I hope to hear from you very soon.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Absolutely.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Thanks for coming Rebecca.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Goodbye.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Alright, great.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
So really good things from Rebecca.

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,840
She said some very interesting things, key things there.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
So why don't we take a look at those on Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,080
At the beginning of the end of the interview, Rebecca says, listen, I think you have covered

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
all the main points for me.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,480
So this is after Mr. Parsons asks her if she has questions.

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,240
And this word covered is very important.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
That's right.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,840
So if we talk about cover, to cover the main points or to cover a topic, it means to discuss

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,880
it thoroughly or to have it finished.

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Right.

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,200
So if I still have questions, we have not covered everything.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,440
But if I did ask all the questions that I have, then we've covered everything.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,160
So the verb here is to cover.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
That's right.

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Okay.

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,040
So Rebecca says, well, you know what, here's my business card with my mobile number.

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,160
So this word business card, key element of any interview or any business situation.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
As you say, a key part of any business interaction.

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,880
So a business card is a very small card, usually thick, and it has a person's name, job, phone

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,940
number and sometimes email address now on the card.

56
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,960
So the information can change, but it's a contact card basically for one person.

57
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
That's right.

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,560
So it's important to have around, especially in situations like this.

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Okay.

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,680
And moving on, he also told her that if she has any other questions to not hesitate and

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
to contact him.

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
This is a very common phrase.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,980
Don't hesitate to contact me or don't hesitate to ask.

64
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
That's right.

65
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,200
So to hesitate means to be nervous about something or to maybe not do it because you're uncomfortable.

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,880
So, you know, Marco, I want to ask you something, but I'm not sure if I want to ask you, maybe

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,440
you'll be angry or so.

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm hesitating.

69
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Right.

70
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Okay.

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
The verb here is to hesitate.

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
You have doubts.

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
I have doubts.

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,940
And so he says, don't hesitate to contact me.

75
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,920
That means any questions, any issues, please call me.

76
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,280
Okay, very good.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,880
And Mr. Parson said that they are finishing the short list of interviews tomorrow.

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
So what does it mean a short list?

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,920
Well, a short list is something we talk about during the interview process because the interviewer,

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,140
so in this case, Mr. Parsons will have a long list of people who want the job.

81
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,800
And maybe after the first interview, he will cut the list down to a very small number of

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,440
people, 10 or 15.

83
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,060
And that is called the short list.

84
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,600
So those are the people who did well on the first interview, but who maybe should come

85
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,680
back for a second or third interview.

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
That's right.

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Okay, very good.

88
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
A lot of great things there.

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,440
Why don't we take a break?

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Let's go back and listen to the dialogue.

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,720
Let's see what Mr. Parsons and Rebecca said.

92
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,800
And we'll be back with some really good phrases that you can close off an interview with.

93
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,360
Well, Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
I don't think so, Mr. Parsons.

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,880
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

96
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,640
Okay, well, listen.

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,900
Here's my business card with my mobile number.

98
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,680
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
Of course, you can also call Ms. Childs, too.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Great.

101
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,760
When can I expect to hear from you?

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,960
Well, we are finishing the short list interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,200
made by early next week.

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,440
Ms. Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
How does that sound?

106
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,080
That sounds perfect.

107
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, Mr. Parsons.

108
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,640
I hope to hear from you very soon.

110
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Absolutely.

111
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Thanks for coming, Rebecca.

112
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Goodbye.

113
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,920
All right, we're back.

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,840
So now let's take a look at those phrases we mentioned on Fluency Builder.

115
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,380
Fluency Builder.

116
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,720
So let's go back to the beginning where Mr. Parsons is talking about questions that Rebecca

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
might have.

118
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,720
And so Mr. Parsons says, if any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
me.

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,400
So this phrase, spring to mind, is very interesting.

121
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
What does this mean?

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Well, basically if something springs to your mind or springs to mind, it means that it

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,400
comes very suddenly and quickly into your mind.

124
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,760
It just pops into your head.

125
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Wow.

126
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,720
So to spring or springs in this case is like jumping.

127
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,520
So something hits your mind very quickly, comes into your mind very quickly.

128
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,400
So oh, I don't really have any ideas, Marco, for that party next week, but if anything

129
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
springs to mind, you should let me know.

130
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Okay.

131
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,720
If you have any sudden ideas or anything you suddenly remember, that's what it means to

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
spring to mind.

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Okay.

134
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,320
So taking a look at these expressions that Rebecca used when she's leaving, for example,

135
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,080
you know that you finished the interview and a typical question that you want to make is,

136
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,760
when can I expect to hear from you?

137
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,800
This is a great question at the end of an interview because it's basically a way of

138
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,280
saying, listen, I'm interested in this job.

139
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,880
When will you call me about it?

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,680
And so the phrase, when can I expect to hear from you means, when will you tell me your

141
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
decision?

142
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
That's right.

143
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,520
But it's a lot more polite and formal and better than saying, when are you going to

144
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
call me?

145
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,120
Yeah, you would never say that in an interview because it makes you sound desperate, like

146
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
you really need the job.

147
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,080
In this case, you know, when can I expect to hear from you?

148
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,640
It's like, oh, well, you know, I hope that you'll get in touch with me.

149
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
That's right.

150
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Okay.

151
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,560
So she explained that they're shortlisting everything and that they will be in touch

152
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
with her very soon.

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,440
And she said, wow, that sounds perfect.

154
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,080
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me.

155
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,840
Okay, so this phrase, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, it's very

156
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
long.

157
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,400
But you know what thank you very much means.

158
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,040
The key here is for taking the time to do something.

159
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Now what does this mean?

160
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,620
What's another way we can use this?

161
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,520
It's basically saying thank you so much for giving me an opportunity to talk to you.

162
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,720
I know you're very busy and I know you don't have a lot of time.

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,760
So thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me.

164
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Right.

165
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,720
So you could even use this with a teacher at school.

166
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,280
You know, you have a question, your teacher is busy, but your teacher makes some time

167
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
to meet with you.

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,440
You say, hey, listen, professor or listen, teacher, thank you so much for taking the

169
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,780
time to speak to me.

170
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,400
You're just demonstrating that you appreciate the effort and the time.

171
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,520
And you're being very polite.

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
That's right.

173
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Okay.

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,200
And then the last phrase, when Rebecca is leaving the room, they're shaking hands maybe

175
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,240
and Rebecca says, I hope to hear from you very soon.

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,520
You can say I hope to hear from you soon.

177
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,920
But in this case, she's saying, listen, I really want this job.

178
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,960
She doesn't want to say, call me, you know, call me tomorrow.

179
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
She says, I hope to hear from you soon.

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,520
I hope that this works out that I get the job.

181
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Right.

182
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,760
So she's basically demonstrating a lot of interest saying, well, I really like the job

183
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,280
and I really would like for you to call me and give me good news.

184
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
So I hope to hear from you soon.

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Exactly.

186
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,720
So let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and we'll be back in a moment to talk

187
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:51,200
a little bit more about how to end an interview.

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
Well Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

189
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
I don't think so, Mr. Parsons.

190
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Okay.

192
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Well, listen, here's my business card with my mobile number.

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,880
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,120
Of course, you can also call Ms. Childs too.

195
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Great.

196
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Um, when can I expect to hear from you?

197
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,160
Well, we are finishing the short list interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision

198
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,400
made by early next week.

199
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Ms. Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

200
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,960
How does that sound?

201
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
That sounds perfect.

202
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,640
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, Mr. Parsons.

203
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

204
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
I hope to hear from you very soon.

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
Absolutely.

206
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Thanks for coming, Rebecca.

207
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,680
Goodbye.

208
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,920
So this is a great way of ending an interview.

209
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,480
Rebecca did a really good job, and I think there are a couple of suggestions or tips

210
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,200
that you would like to give our users.

211
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Yeah, well, one of them is don't, at the end of the interview, ask the person if you have

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
the job.

213
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,120
They'll say, we will be in touch, or thank you so much for coming in.

214
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,120
But if they don't say, we would really like to have you join this company, then you probably

215
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
shouldn't ask.

216
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,680
You should say, you know, when can I expect to hear from you?

217
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,240
That's more polite.

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,960
Because I think a lot of times, if you didn't get the job, it makes the interviewer feel

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,860
very uncomfortable.

220
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,480
But also, it's just a polite thing to do.

221
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,840
So be careful with that.

222
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,400
And I've also been told from people in business that if you do receive a job offer, don't

223
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,040
accept right away.

224
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,960
Say I will think about it, and I'll get back in touch with you.

225
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Oh, OK.

226
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,280
Kind of like a strategy maybe to better negotiate the terms and conditions.

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Exactly.

228
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,280
So you want to take that information, you want to go home, you want to think about it,

229
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,340
talk about it with your wife or your husband, and decide, is this something I want?

230
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,400
And then you can contact the employer.

231
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Right.

232
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,120
Yeah, I think that's a very good idea.

233
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,840
And also, I think it's not a wise thing to call or contact the employer asking if you've

234
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,760
got the job or asking if they have any news yet, because I think that can be a little

235
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
bit annoying.

236
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,760
But if they say, we will be in touch on Tuesday, and it's a week later, and they never got

237
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,800
back to you, send a follow up.

238
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Of course.

239
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,600
A follow up is an email or a letter or even a phone call where you say, listen, I'm really

240
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,320
glad I got to meet you today.

241
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,640
I hope that we have the opportunity to work together in the future.

242
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Always be in touch.

243
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
Sincerely, and then your name.

244
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Kind of like a reminder.

245
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,120
It's a reminder, like, I want the job.

246
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
Here's my information.

247
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Let's do this.

248
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,320
Or at least if I didn't get the job, let me know that I didn't get it.

249
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Yeah, exactly.

250
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
All right.

251
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
So a lot of great advice here.

252
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,760
Great things coming.

253
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,320
And we'll be back again with another series.

254
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,200
We're going to have a presentation series.

255
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,400
So be sure to keep an eye out for that.

256
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,360
And if you have any other questions or comments, we're always at EnglishPod.com where you can

257
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
find us.

258
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
We'll see you there.

259
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,600
Bye-bye.
