00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,800
My name is Catherine and today we've got a very nerve-wracking situation for you.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
That's right.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,560
We are going to meet the in-laws.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Meeting the in-laws.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,800
So who are in-laws?

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,960
These are the parents of your husband or wife.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Right.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,720
So in this case, you have the mother-in-law and your father-in-law.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
That's right.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,120
We're meeting these people for the very first time.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,200
You can imagine how nervous the man is who's meeting his future wife's parents.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,440
Let's learn all about what they talk about in today's dialogue.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Mother, father, I'd like to introduce you to my fiancÃ©, Bob.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,760
Hello, Bob.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Welcome.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Thanks for having me.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Nice to meet the both of you.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,520
I've heard so much.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,040
So Cindy told you about bringing home her last boyfriend then.

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
That idiot.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Shhh, Thurston.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
You're going to scare the poor boy.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,920
Come in and have a drink.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,240
Dinner will be on in just a bit.

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,240
What will you be having?

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,280
Whiskey, bourbon?

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
Pick your poison.

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,120
If you have a lemonade, that'd be great.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Lemonade?

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Why, sure.

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
There's some in the fridge.

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
Mother makes her own lemonade from scratch.

35
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,320
It's the best.

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080
So what are your hobbies, son?

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
If you want, we can do some hunting tomorrow.

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,680
I've just picked up a new rifle I've been meaning to try out.

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
It should be a real hoot.

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,120
Um, I'm not really, uh, I don't really hunt.

41
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
You don't hunt?

42
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,840
Well, I'll beat damn.

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,040
Bob is an animal rights activist.

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
He doesn't believe in harming animals.

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Dinner's ready.

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,400
Let's go out to the patio where the pig is roasting.

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Roast pig?

48
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm a vegetarian.

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,680
All right, we're back.

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,160
So a very awkward situation.

51
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,360
I think they might have a little bit of a problems in the future.

52
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeah, there's there are a lot of cultural differences between the characters, the son-in-law

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,800
and the new parents, the father.

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,480
So it's really interesting.

55
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,800
Why don't we start off by looking at a couple of different words on language takeaway.

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,840
Language takeaway.

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,380
So first of all, we have the two characters, Cindy and Bob, who are getting married.

58
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,800
So we call them, we call Bob, Cindy's fiance.

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Right.

60
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,560
So my fiance.

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,360
And it's, uh, it comes from French and it means to the person that you're going to get

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
married to.

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
That's right.

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,840
The person you've decided to get married to.

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,800
So we say fiance.

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,320
We can say the same word for a man or a woman.

67
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,000
So he is my fiance.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,360
She is my fiance.

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Okay.

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
My fiance.

71
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Very good.

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,240
So Cindy introduces her fiance, Bob, to her parents and they start talking a little bit

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,800
and her dad, Thurston, invites him to go do some hunting tomorrow.

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
That's right.

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,840
So hunting is a sport in America and lots of places in the world where you shoot animals.

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Okay.

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,960
So you go in the woods, you wear brown and green colors and you shoot animals to take

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,240
them home and skin them and eat them or to keep them as trophies.

79
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
All right.

80
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,640
So you go hunting and well, the way that you shoot these animals is you need to have a

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
rifle.

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
A rifle.

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,400
So you could also call it a hunting rifle in this case.

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,720
A rifle is a gun, but it's a very long gun.

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Right.

86
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,240
So it's not a little gun that you just hold in your hand.

87
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
It's very long.

88
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,360
It'll be maybe like half a meter, a meter long.

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
That's right.

90
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,120
And so oftentimes people, when they're hunting, they lie on the ground and they wait for the

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,600
animals to pass and they hide themselves and then they shoot from a long distance.

92
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Right.

93
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
So he's talking about hunting.

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,560
He's got a new rifle and he says, yeah, we should definitely go.

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,600
It should be a real hoot.

96
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Should be a real hoot.

97
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,280
This is a very fun spoken English phrase.

98
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,760
It's said more by older people than by younger people.

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,840
So this is why the father says it in the dialogue.

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,480
A hoot should be a real good time, real fun.

101
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,080
So how can you can use this like, oh, the party last night was a real hoot.

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Yeah.

103
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
You can say that.

104
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,520
You can say or she's a real hoot.

105
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
She's really funny.

106
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Okay.

107
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
But it's really enjoyable.

108
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,000
This is a little bit more like spoken and for used by maybe older people.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,720
My mother would say that I wouldn't say this.

110
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,520
So, oh my goodness, it was a real hoot.

111
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah.

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
All right.

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,800
So he's talking about hunting, how much fun they would have.

114
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,160
And unfortunately, Bob is an animal rights activist.

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
What does this mean?

116
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,440
So an animal rights activist is someone who is very concerned with protecting the rights

117
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
of animals.

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,960
So for example, if I'm an animal rights activist, maybe I will protest people who wear fur or

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,720
perhaps I will also try and secure land for a natural wildlife preserve so that animals

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
can live in the wild.

121
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,800
There's not houses or cars.

122
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
So animal rights activists are people who try to make sure that animals are protected

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,080
from human beings.

124
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,320
Okay, very good.

125
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,420
And this is what Bob is.

126
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,880
So obviously Bob is not really into hunting, right?

127
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm guessing no.

128
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
These are two opposites.

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,040
You have people who like to kill animals and people who want to protect the lives of animals.

130
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Right.

131
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Okay.

132
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Well, and to finish off our language takeaway, dinner is ready.

133
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,440
So let's go out to the patio.

134
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Okay.

135
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,120
A patio is a space outside the house, usually in the back that's paved.

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
So there's like cement or bricks or some kind of tile.

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,640
And that's where you have a table and chairs or some place to sit and rest.

138
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,120
This is where you have a grill.

139
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,360
So it's an outdoor area, but it's not grass.

140
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay.

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
So it's not your backyard.

142
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,260
Oh, it could be in your backyard.

143
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,040
The patio could be in the backyard.

144
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
That's right.

145
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,400
But the ground in the patio is not grass.

146
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,040
It's some kind of material like cement or brick or wood.

147
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,080
Okay, very good.

148
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
So great words there.

149
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,440
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
All right, we're back.

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,360
So we have three great phrases here on Fluency Builder.

152
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,240
Why don't we start off with the first one?

153
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,600
So the first one, we have to go back to the very beginning of this dialogue and think

154
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,080
about these people who are introducing each other for the very first time.

155
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,400
Cindy says, I want to introduce you to my fiance, Bob.

156
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,480
Bob says to Cindy's parents, I've heard so much.

157
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,240
I've heard so much.

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Okay.

159
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,960
So this phrase, you can usually use it when you meet somebody for the first time.

160
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I've heard so much about you.

161
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
That's right.

162
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,960
So the longer version is I've heard so much about you.

163
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,280
Basically you're saying, listen, Cindy talks about you a lot.

164
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,880
I've heard really nice things.

165
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Sometimes people like to joke.

166
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,640
You say, I've heard so much about you.

167
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,560
They say, I hope only good things.

168
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,880
Yeah, I hope not too much.

169
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
I hope not too much.

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,720
So this is a very polite way to respond when someone introduces themselves.

171
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay.

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,880
I've heard so much about you.

173
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,200
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

174
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Exactly.

175
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Okay.

176
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,920
So they started talking and actually Thurston offers him a drink.

177
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,400
He says, well, what do you want?

178
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,840
Whiskey, bourbon?

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Pick your poison.

180
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
All right.

181
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,320
This is one of my very favorite phrases in English.

182
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,340
The father-in-law wants to give the new son-in-law a drink.

183
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,480
And there are many different options.

184
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,600
So pick your poison means pick your drink.

185
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You might hear this at a bar.

186
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
What do you want to drink?

187
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Pick your poison.

188
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Right.

189
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
You could have whiskey, rum.

190
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,040
So usually we're just talking about alcoholic drinks.

191
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Okay.

192
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,920
So you wouldn't really use this for juices or water or something like that?

193
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Nah.

194
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
This is for alcohol.

195
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Okay.

196
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,360
So if you say pick your poison, that's for alcohol, right?

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,640
Or maybe you can ask somebody what they're drinking.

198
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,520
You would say, what's your poison?

199
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Yeah.

200
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
What's your poison?

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Okay.

202
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,840
So poison in this case is a slang term for alcohol.

203
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
Very good.

204
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,600
And finally, when Cindy was talking about lemonade that her mother made, she said she

205
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,840
makes it from scratch, to make something from scratch.

206
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,440
You could say, my mother makes chocolate chip cookies from scratch.

207
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,440
This means not to buy something in the store, but to make it all yourself from nothing.

208
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,640
So making lemonade from scratch means taking lemons, cutting them, taking the juice, adding

209
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
some sugar.

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,500
So you're making it from nothing.

211
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,880
You're not using some kind of kit or some kind of canned drink from the store.

212
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Okay.

213
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,240
So for example, maybe some Italians in Italy make their spaghetti from scratch with flour

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
and they knead it and they make everything from scratch.

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Wow.

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
So you don't buy a box of spaghetti, but you actually have to cut the spaghetti and

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
pull it.

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Exactly.

219
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Very, very hard work.

220
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
So to make something from scratch.

221
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,680
And usually you can add the something goes in between, right?

222
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,520
To make lemonade from scratch, make bread from scratch.

223
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,000
Make ice cream from scratch.

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,320
So those are our three phrases for today.

226
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Let's listen to the dialogue for one last time and we'll be back to talk about this

227
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,440
very, very interesting topic.

228
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Mother, father, I'd like to introduce you to my fiance, Bob.

229
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Hello, Bob.

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Welcome.

231
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Thanks for having me.

232
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,920
Uh, nice to meet the both of you.

233
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,720
I've heard so much.

234
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,240
So Cindy told you about bringing home her last boyfriend then.

235
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
That idiot.

236
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Shhh.

237
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Thurston, you're going to scare the poor boy.

238
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Come in and have a drink.

239
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,400
Dinner will be on in just a bit.

240
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,960
What will you be having?

241
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,320
Whiskey, bourbon, pick your poison.

242
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
If you have a lemonade, that'd be great.

243
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Lemonade?

244
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,200
Why sure, there's some in the fridge.

245
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,360
Mother makes her own lemonade from scratch.

246
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
It's the best.

247
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,280
So, what are your hobbies, son?

248
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,600
If you want, we can do some hunting tomorrow.

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,120
I've just picked up a new rifle I've been meaning to try out.

250
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Should be a real hoot.

251
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,340
Um, I'm not really, uh, I don't really hunt.

252
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
You don't hunt?

253
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,080
Well, I'll be damned.

254
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Bob is an animal rights activist.

255
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,640
He doesn't believe in harming animals.

256
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Dinner's ready.

257
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,600
Let's go out to the patio where the pig is roasting.

258
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Roast pig?

259
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a vegetarian.

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,400
This is a very scary topic for a lot of people.

261
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,760
I think they get very nervous introducing themselves because in this case, Bob is going

262
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,160
to be marrying Cindy.

263
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,480
So these are going to be his in-laws forever.

264
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah, and it seems interesting, the differences, as you mentioned before, between the father-in-law

265
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,960
who's very much into hunting and drinks and likes roast pig, whereas this guy is more

266
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,960
of an animal rights activist, doesn't drink.

267
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
He's a vegetarian.

268
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
And a vegetarian.

269
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
He doesn't eat meat.

270
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,760
So, I think it would be very complicated.

271
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,640
And I think this happens a lot also with people from different cultures, right?

272
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,040
Maybe you're Asian and you're marrying an American or something like this.

273
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Yeah, that's right.

274
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
I think it can be very, very difficult.

275
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,560
I recently went to a wedding between a Chinese girl and an American guy, and it was amazing

276
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,040
to see all these people getting together because the families were so different.

277
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,280
But they all got along really well.

278
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
It was really fun.

279
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
They were all very supportive.

280
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,160
They were just excited for their kids.

281
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,240
Yeah, but I think it can be a little bit difficult, right?

282
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,640
I mean, being in a family where the culture is so different or the traditions and the

283
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,880
customs are strange to you.

284
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,680
But it's exciting because then as a family, the young people who are getting married,

285
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,880
they can pick the traditions they want and make new traditions.

286
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,580
So this is a very interesting topic.

287
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,200
We want to know, maybe if you are married, how did it go when you met your in-laws?

288
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,520
Are you very different?

289
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,600
Or did you get along very well?

290
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
Or how is it in your country?

291
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
Yeah, please do let us know.

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,620
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

293
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,620
We hope to see you there.

294
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
All right, everyone.

295
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
Bye.

296
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:18,440
It looks like we've just gotta do our job.
