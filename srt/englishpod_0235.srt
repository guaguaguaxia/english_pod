00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello, everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,560
My name is Katherine and today we have a very special lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,560
This is actually the first in a series of lessons about interview skills.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,560
That's right.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,880
For 10 lessons that you will hear once a week for the next 10 weeks, we're going to take

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,160
a look at an interview, a job interview and we're going to take you step by step throughout

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,560
the whole interview process as well as teaching you some useful words and phrases that you

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,320
can use next time you're at a job interview in English.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Exactly.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
So pay attention.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,720
Today is the first day we're going to be entering the office and we're going to learn some things

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:52,000
that are important for talking to your future employer or meeting people in an interview.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,800
Come in.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Mr. Parsons?

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Ah, you must be Rebecca.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,880
Please do come in.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,400
Thank you for making some time to see me, Mr. Parsons.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,320
It's a pleasure to meet you finally.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,840
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,480
Have a seat, please.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,440
Now would you like any refreshments, tea or coffee?

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,800
A coffee would be lovely.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Thank you.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,960
Black, no sugar.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,120
No problem.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,440
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,320
One, no milk or sugar.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Certainly, Mr. Parsons.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,280
So Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Ms. Childs last week?

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,520
Yes, that's correct.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,080
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Great.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,160
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview and here we are.

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,360
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,840
Yes, of course.

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Alright, we're back.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,960
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,880
Language takeaway.

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,440
So one of the first things that you're offered when you go to interview at a company is refreshments.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Right.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,520
Would you like any refreshments?

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,480
This sounds complicated, but it's actually a very simple word for beverages or drinks.

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Right.

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,120
So that's why he offered her tea or coffee.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Right.

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
So refreshments are cola, coffee, tea.

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,480
But how do you answer this?

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,960
If I say, would you like any refreshments, Marco?

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,440
You can say, yes, water would be fine.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Thank you.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Okay.

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Water would be fine.

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Or I'd like a Coke.

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
Or I'd like a cup of coffee.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Cup of coffee.

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Great.

58
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
So that's how you answer drinks.

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,280
And after that, the characters are talking about the details of the job.

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,920
So what are these details?

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
How are they different from the job itself?

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Well, the details of the job are the specific points about the job.

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,340
So for example, if she applied for a job as a receptionist, the details of the job would

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,220
be answering the phones, taking messages, receiving people at the office.

65
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,360
Those are the main details of the job.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Also, we need someone who works from 9am to 5pm, someone who is going to come five days

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
a week.

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,160
So the details are basically more information about something.

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Right.

70
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,480
The specific information about a general topic.

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,680
And it's not only related to work.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
The details can be of many, many things.

73
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Right.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,840
So if I ask you about your details, Marco, you could maybe tell me your phone number,

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
your address.

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
My full name.

77
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,240
Your full name or birthday.

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
So these are details.

79
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Okay.

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,040
And well, after they talked about the details of the job, after she explained that she received

81
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:59,760
the details of the job by phone, Mr. Parson said that she was recommended for a second

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
interview.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,340
So Rebecca is coming to the office for a second time.

84
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,040
She already had one interview.

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,720
And the woman she talked to the first time recommended her for a second interview.

86
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
So the verb here is to recommend.

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
Right.

88
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,980
And you can recommend a person, an object, a movie.

89
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,560
And that's basically you are saying that this is good and that it's worth seeing, it's worth

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,120
buying, it's worth interviewing.

91
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,760
For example, I really like the movie Avatar.

92
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,200
Marco, I recommend you see it.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Okay.

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,400
And you can say, Catherine recommended the movie Avatar.

95
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Okay.

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
So Catherine liked it.

97
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,760
Catherine decided, Catherine suggested or told Marco it would be good.

98
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
That's right.

99
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,800
So to recommend.

100
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,680
And then Mr. Parson said that they're going to start discussing her background.

101
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,560
Well, background, think of the word back.

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,840
That means behind.

103
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,840
This usually means a person's history at a job or at many jobs or even their educational

104
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
background, information about where they studied.

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
That's right.

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,280
So the background, maybe a person's background is, as you said, all their history, work,

107
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,040
study, many, many different things, even maybe seminars or courses that they assisted.

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,600
Or even just their personal history.

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,640
For example, Marco, you speak English like an American.

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,840
What's your background because I know you're not American.

111
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Right.

112
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm from Ecuador.

113
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Okay.

114
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Background.

115
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
So that means someone's personal history.

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
That's right.

117
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,680
And hand in hand with background, we have a piece of paper that usually you send into

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,640
an employer to apply for a job.

119
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
This is the famous resume.

120
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Resume.

121
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,360
So you're right, Marco.

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,860
Resume is a document.

123
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,600
In this case, it is a document that lists your work history, your working background.

124
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,920
And it's a very important part of applying for a job.

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,640
And usually you send your resume before you go for the interview so that the employer

126
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,400
can look and see is this person qualified, how old are they, what's their work history.

127
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,080
And well, very similar to a resume, you may have heard a CV.

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
That's right.

129
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,200
A CV is a lot like a resume.

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,220
It stands for curriculum C, vitae V, CV.

131
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,120
And it's more detailed.

132
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,400
It has more details about a person's academic or study history.

133
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Exactly.

134
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,360
So a resume, I guess it's very similar to a summary, a summary of your work background.

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,080
Whereas a CV will have more details about your education, maybe more details about your

136
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,400
work background, what did you do, objectives, etc.

137
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Great.

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,040
So maybe we should listen to today's dialogue one more time.

139
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,920
And when we come back, we'll be talking about some of the interesting phrases we heard in

140
00:06:51,920 --> 00:07:01,400
today's dialogue.

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Come in.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
Mr. Parsons.

143
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Ah, you must be Rebecca.

144
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Please do come in.

145
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,240
Thank you for making some time to see me, Mr. Parsons.

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
It's a pleasure to meet you finally.

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,280
Have a seat, please.

149
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,240
Now would you like any refreshments, tea or coffee?

150
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,320
A coffee would be lovely, thank you.

151
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,800
Black, no sugar.

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
No problem.

153
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,240
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
One, no milk or sugar.

155
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Certainly, Mr. Parsons.

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,120
So Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Ms. Childs last week?

157
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
Yes, that's correct.

158
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Great.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview.

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
And here we are.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

163
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,280
Yes, of course.

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,240
Alright, we're back.

165
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,720
So now we have three phrases that we're going to take a look at on Fluency Builder.

166
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Fluency Builder.

167
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,440
Alright, so when Rebecca arrived, Mr. Parsons said, ah, you must be Rebecca.

168
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,080
Please do come in.

169
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,440
Okay, so you could say, please come in.

170
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,800
This means, please come into my office or come on in.

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Right.

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
But here, the interesting thing about this is the word do.

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,240
Right, he's using the verb do and it may sound wrong.

174
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,080
It may sound like it's unnecessary because you do have a phrasal verb there already,

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
come in.

176
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,960
So you can just say, please come in.

177
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,040
But when he says, please do come in, he is emphasizing on her to come in.

178
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
That's right.

179
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,240
So this is a very polite way to invite someone inside.

180
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,080
You can also say, please do have a seat.

181
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,120
Alright, so again, you are emphasizing in a very polite way to please sit down.

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
That's right.

183
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Please do come in.

184
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,160
So there are many other ways that you can use it.

185
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,400
So for example, if you really want your friend to call you sometime next time you're in town,

186
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,040
say please do call me next time you're in town.

187
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,280
Please do.

188
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,520
You could even say it afterwards, simply please do for emphasis.

189
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Right.

190
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,960
So if I say, hey, Catherine, I'm going to call you next time I'm in Shanghai.

191
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Please do.

192
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
There you go.

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
So that means, please do call.

194
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,160
Alright, so please do come in.

195
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,560
Please do call.

196
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Alright.

197
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,640
After that, Rebecca says, thank you for making some time to see me, Mr. Parsons.

198
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,280
So she is happy that Mr. Parsons is available and wants to talk to her.

199
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,880
This is a very common phrase that means, thank you so much for interviewing me.

200
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Right.

201
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,840
So I guess it's kind of a way of saying, look, I know that you're a busy person and that

202
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
you don't have very much time.

203
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,960
So thank you for making some time to see me.

204
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Right.

205
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,120
So this isn't just about interviews.

206
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,720
You could say this phrase for meeting with a client or meeting with even a friend.

207
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,260
You could say, hey, Marco, I know you were really busy last week, but thank you so much

208
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,120
for making some time to see me.

209
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Right.

210
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,480
So it's just basically saying, I understand that you're very busy, but I appreciate that

211
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,520
you made some time to see me.

212
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Mm hmm.

213
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
All right.

214
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,560
And well, she said, you know what?

215
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,240
It's a pleasure to meet you, but Mr. Parsons replied by saying, the pleasure is all mine.

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
All right.

217
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Another very, very polite phrase that you hear a lot.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,080
Maybe some of you have heard the phrase, it's a pleasure to meet you before, but the response,

219
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,560
the answer is very interesting.

220
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
The pleasure is all mine.

221
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Right.

222
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
So this stands for the pleasure is all mine.

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Mm hmm.

224
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Right.

225
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,200
And I guess it's the most appropriate response if somebody says, it's a pleasure to meet

226
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,960
you, because if you don't say this, I think you may sound a little bit arrogant.

227
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,600
Well, you could say it's a pleasure to meet you too.

228
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Right.

229
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,800
But this is another way to answer the person because you don't always want to say it's

230
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,920
a pleasure to meet you.

231
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,240
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Right.

233
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,040
This is a way to say something different and to say, well, the pleasure is all mine.

234
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Right.

235
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
But it's very important to answer something, right?

236
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,800
Because if I say, it's a pleasure to meet you and you say, thank you.

237
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,560
It's like, no, that is a little bit arrogant.

238
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
You have to say something.

239
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Right.

240
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,520
And we recommend that you say this or you just say the same thing back.

241
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
So it's nice to meet you.

242
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,480
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

243
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Right.

244
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Okay.

245
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,720
And our last phrase is actually when they were talking about, again, the details of

246
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
the job.

247
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,680
And she said that Miss Childs filled her in on the details.

248
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,160
She said, she filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

249
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Okay.

250
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,360
So this is an interesting verb, to fill in, or in this case, to fill someone in, to fill

251
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,560
me in, to fill you in.

252
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,000
This basically means to tell someone about something.

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Or if I know a little bit of information, but not a lot of information about something,

254
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
this way you're telling me more so I understand it better.

255
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Right.

256
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I'm giving you all the information.

257
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,240
So maybe there is somebody is talking about a rumor in the office and you go and you say,

258
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,160
hey, fill me in on the gossip.

259
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
All right.

260
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
So you want to know all about it.

261
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Right.

262
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
So you go, we're having a party next Sunday, but I'll have to fill you in on the details

263
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
around Friday.

264
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Okay.

265
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
Because you don't have all the information right now.

266
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah.

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know yet what time or where.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,040
So to fill someone in is to give them all the information or to give them more information.

270
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Fill me in.

271
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Fill me in.

272
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
All right.

273
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,880
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a little

274
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
bit.

275
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:39,320
Come in.

276
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Mr. Parsons.

277
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,920
Ah, you must be Rebecca.

278
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,380
Please do come in.

279
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,920
Thank you for making some time to see me, Mr. Parsons.

280
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,240
It's a pleasure to meet you.

281
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,080
Finally, the pleasure is all mine.

282
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,000
Rebecca, have a seat, please.

283
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,920
Now would you like any refreshments, tea or coffee?

284
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,320
A coffee would be lovely.

285
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Thank you.

286
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
Black, no sugar.

287
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,280
No problem.

288
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,960
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

289
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,840
One, no milk or sugar.

290
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,920
Certainly, Mr. Parsons.

291
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,760
So Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Ms. Childs last week?

292
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,020
Yes, that's correct.

293
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,520
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

294
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Great.

295
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,680
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview and here we are.

296
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,880
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

297
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Yes, of course.

298
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:39,760
Alright, so as we mentioned, this is the first part of a ten-part series of the interview

299
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,080
series and this is going to be very, very helpful.

300
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,400
As you saw in this first part, we're just taking a look at some basic vocab and phrases

301
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,200
that you can use when you're just introducing yourself, you're just getting started in the

302
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
interview.

303
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,880
So, what we're going to be looking at later on is talking about yourself, answering questions,

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,120
but many people don't realize that one of the most important parts of the interview

305
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,560
is the very, very beginning because some psychologists say that we make a decision about a person

306
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,480
or how we like a person within the first, I think, what, 30 seconds of talking to them?

307
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I think so, yeah.

308
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,480
So, it's important that you speak confidently and that you speak, say some of these English

309
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,560
phrases comfortably.

310
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
It's a pleasure to meet you.

311
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,200
Oh, it's the pleasure is mine.

312
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,240
These little things will really help you.

313
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
That's right.

314
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,600
And I think as talking about introductions and how this woman arrived to the office,

315
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,040
I think one of the key things that we would recommend is to look that person in the eye

316
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
and give a firm handshake.

317
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,820
I don't know how many people actually realize how important this is.

318
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,800
It's very, very important because as an interviewer, the person or the manager who's interviewing

319
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,080
you, I think you can tell a lot from a person if somebody gives you a very flimsy handshake

320
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,980
or doesn't look you in the eye.

321
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
That's right.

322
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,760
Well, I think in many ways people think, oh, this person is not confident or this person

323
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,400
is uncomfortable or this person is hiding something.

324
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,520
And so, it's important really to be yourself, to smile, to look at a person in the eyes,

325
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,040
especially in a lot of like American companies or Canadian companies.

326
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,880
I know in other parts of the world, smiling with a stranger is unusual or maybe unacceptable,

327
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,160
but in America it means I'm confident.

328
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Here I am.

329
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Here's my name.

330
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Nice to meet you.

331
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,280
It's a very important part of an introduction.

332
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,520
Yes, very true.

333
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,340
So we actually want to hear what you think.

334
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:46,240
How important for you is a handshake, a firm handshake, looking someone in the eye or how

335
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,880
do interviews work in your country?

336
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
Let us know and we hope that this is helpful for you in the future if you're looking for

337
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,120
jobs or you just want to practice your English.

338
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
That's right.

339
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
So, if you have any other questions or doubts, we're at EnglishPod.com.

340
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
We'll see everyone there.

341
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Bye.

342
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Thank you.
