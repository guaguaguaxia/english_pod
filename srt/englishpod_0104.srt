00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,760
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,920
And today we're bringing you another part of our sports series and this time it's an

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
advanced lesson.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
That's right.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,280
We're heading to the mountains today to take a skiing lesson.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,180
Alright, so we're going to be learning about skiing, a winter sport and very popular throughout

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,180
the world.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,880
But before we get started, why don't we take a look at a couple of words in Vocabulary

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,880
Preview.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
Alright, so we're going to hear these two words in our dialogue.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,720
The first one is fresh powder.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Fresh powder.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
Fresh powder.

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,160
Okay, so powder.

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,400
We probably know this phrase already.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, but here we're talking about fresh light snow.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,560
So fresh light snow, snow that recently fell.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Yep.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,920
Okay, so it looks like powder.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,360
The best kind for skiing on.

25
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,800
Okay, the best kind.

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,160
Alright, so fresh powder.

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
What about our next phrase?

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,480
Well, we're also going to meet a four-time giant slalom champion.

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Alright, a four-time giant slalom champion.

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,480
Okay, so giant slalom is a type of ski race.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,920
When you probably see it on TV when they go down the hill and they have to go through

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,360
these red or blue flags, right?

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Yep.

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,160
Now, four-time giant slalom champion means he won the giant slalom four times.

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Okay.

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,960
That's an interesting way of saying that somebody did something many times.

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Right.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
So I can say the three-time Nobel Prize winner.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
Yes, exactly.

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Okay.

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Or the five-time Olympic gold medalist.

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,800
Okay, perfect.

43
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,040
So now it's time for us to go to the mountains with our famous Rick Fields and Bob Copeland

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
and we'll see what happens.

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:59,880
Welcome, ski lovers of all ages.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,280
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Thank you, Rick.

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,960
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
inches of fresh powder.

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,920
It doesn't get much better than this.

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
That's right, Bob.

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,560
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,480
We're joined here by Ian Russe, four-time giant slalom champion.

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,440
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
So let's hit the slopes.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,640
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,320
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
That's right.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Now snap them into your bindings.

60
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,600
And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

61
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,340
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

62
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,360
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,760
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,280
Easy there, Rick.

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,200
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,720
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,960
So Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns?

69
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,480
Gnarly run, Rick.

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Nice carving.

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
You've got some mad skills.

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,120
That was sick.

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
You want to see gnarly?

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
Well, see that bump over there?

75
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm going to catch some major air.

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Butt plant.

77
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Ha ha ha.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
He lost his skis.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Yard sale.

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,280
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,840
I think that about does it.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,600
Bob, Ian, time for some aprÃ¨s-ski?

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
No way, man.

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:43,360
We're off to grab some freshies.

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,720
Pretty embarrassing for Rick there, wasn't it?

86
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah, he was a little bit cocky and then he ended up falling.

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Well, I think there's a lesson in that for all of us, but what the real lesson is today

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,720
is language.

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
So why don't we start with language takeaway?

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Language takeaway.

91
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,280
All right, on language takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word.

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
We have some bindings.

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Bindings.

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Bindings.

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,560
Bindings are sort of like a lock that attaches your boot to your ski.

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,760
So those are the bindings.

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,560
I guess it comes from the verb to bind.

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Yeah, to tie something so that it stays.

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Okay.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Binding.

101
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,880
So for example, my bindings are broken.

102
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Okay.

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,240
And another piece of skiing equipment and very important is goggles.

104
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Goggles.

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,200
Okay, we have goggles now.

106
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Yep.

107
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,560
Not to be confused with Google.

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,440
It's spelled almost the same way, huh?

109
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Yep.

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,280
But goggles are kind of like, imagine a big pair of glasses that you wear when you ski.

111
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,240
So it makes people kind of look like flies.

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Yes.

113
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
They have these huge glasses.

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Yeah.

115
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,480
And you'll also see safety goggles, which you might wear if you are a mechanic fixing

116
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,560
a car or someone working with wood or chemicals or what have you.

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,640
Okay, so goggles basically protect your eyes from snow, from the sun, from anything.

118
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
That's right.

119
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
All right.

120
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,840
So moving on to our next ski word.

121
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,800
They said you should wear the goggles so that you don't accidentally go over the moguls.

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,480
Okay, moguls.

123
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,920
It sounds kind of strange.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,800
What are these things?

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,280
Basically these are the bumps that are in a ski hill.

126
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Bumps.

127
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,960
Okay, so they're kind of like mini little hills.

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Yep.

129
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,200
And they're very difficult to ski over, right?

130
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
That's right.

131
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,080
You got to be pretty good to handle those moguls.

132
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Okay.

133
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,400
Now, since these guys are beginner skiers, they're starting out on the bunny hill.

134
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
A bunny hill.

135
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
The bunny hill.

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Okay.

137
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
Very popular among skiers.

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,120
The bunny hill is the easiest hill.

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,440
So it's where the beginners start to learn.

140
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Yeah, all the kids.

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,560
All the kids are on the bunny hill.

142
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
All right.

143
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
And our final words.

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,880
Actually, we're going to look at two words here because they mean almost exactly the

145
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,160
same thing.

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,080
We heard the ski instructor say gnarly.

147
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Gnarly run.

148
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Yeah, gnarly.

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,200
So an interesting word.

150
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
It's spelled G-N-A-R-L-E-Y.

151
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay, but you don't say gnarly.

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
No.

153
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
You say gnarly.

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Okay.

155
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
And a related word, sick.

156
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Okay.

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,520
Now, sick means to be sick, right?

158
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
No, no, no.

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Not here.

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,960
Let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

161
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,000
Example one.

162
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,880
Those were some sick dance moves.

163
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,280
You are amazing.

164
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,760
Example two.

165
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,960
Jack and I went to the beach yesterday and surfed some really gnarly waves.

166
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Example three.

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,600
Man, the concha last night was sick.

168
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I can't believe we got front row seats.

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Okay.

170
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,400
So, basically, gnarly and sick, they mean that it's amazing, it was cool.

171
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
It's awesome.

172
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Awesome.

173
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah.

174
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,280
So, these two words are very, very informal.

175
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
It's slang.

176
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah.

177
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,680
And actually, skier slang.

178
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,240
Both of these words, I think, originated with skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders.

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Gnarly dudes.

180
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Gnarly dudes.

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
So, okay.

182
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,720
So, that's all the words we have for language takeaway, but we have some great phrases that

183
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,880
we want to take a look at before we listen to the dialogue again.

184
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,840
So, it's time now for Fluency Builder.

185
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Fluency Builder.

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
All right.

187
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,040
So, Rick said that it is time to...

188
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,720
So, Rick invited everyone to start skiing by saying, let's hit the slopes.

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Okay.

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,960
So, to hit the slopes.

191
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
To hit the slopes.

192
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Okay.

193
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,440
Now, we want to hit the slopes.

194
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
What does that mean?

195
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Let's go skiing.

196
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Let's go skiing.

197
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Let's go to the mountain.

198
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Yep.

199
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,680
Now, we can change the noun slope for something else, right?

200
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Yeah.

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
You can change it for a lot of other different nouns.

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,400
And why don't we hear some examples of how you can do that?

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Example one.

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,960
I really have to hit the books and study for my exam tomorrow.

205
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,240
Example two.

206
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm really tired.

207
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
I think I'm going to hit the bed now.

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
Example three.

209
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,920
Honey, can we hit the supermarket on our way home?

210
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I need to buy some milk.

211
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
Okay, great.

212
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,440
So, great examples and now we understand how we can use the hit the something.

213
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
All right.

214
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,240
What about our next phrase?

215
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,560
Well, Rick warned Bob that he might take a few spills.

216
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Okay.

217
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
So, to take a spill.

218
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,880
To take a spill.

219
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Take a spill.

220
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Fall.

221
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
To fall.

222
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Yep.

223
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
It means like a light fall or...

224
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,440
Yeah, a pretty dramatic fall.

225
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Pretty dramatic.

226
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
So, you fell.

227
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah.

228
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,320
So, for example, instead of saying, that little girl was riding her bike and she fell, I can

229
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,880
say, that little girl was riding her bike and she took a bad spill.

230
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Yep.

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Okay.

232
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
So, to take a spill.

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
You have to use the verb take though.

234
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Yes, exactly.

235
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
You cannot just spill.

236
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Okay.

237
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
You have to take a spill.

238
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
All right.

239
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
What about our next phrase?

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,680
Well, you might take a spill when you catch some major air.

241
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Okay.

242
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
To catch some major air.

243
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
To catch some major air.

244
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,760
So, am I catching something?

245
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,920
How am I catching air?

246
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
That's impossible.

247
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,720
Well, imagine if you're jumping and your skis are catching the air.

248
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Ah, okay.

249
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
So, I'm in the air for a very long time maybe?

250
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Yeah.

251
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,880
When you catch some air, basically, it's like you're flying for a couple of seconds.

252
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,360
So, you're flying for a couple of seconds.

253
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
You're very high up in the air.

254
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Yep.

255
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Okay.

256
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
To catch some air.

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Yeah.

258
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,880
And you'll hear this phrase when you're, you know, not only when you're talking about skiing,

259
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,000
but also maybe if you're, you know, you're driving your car really fast and it sort of

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,960
jumps up in the air for a minute, well, not a minute, a second, that would be catching

261
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
air as well.

262
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Okay.

263
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
So, to catch air.

264
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
All right.

265
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
So, they finished skiing.

266
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,880
They were kind of tired and he said, well, let's call it a day.

267
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,360
To call it a day.

268
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
Let's call it a day.

269
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Let's go home.

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Let's go home.

271
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
It's over.

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Let's finish.

273
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Let's finish the day.

274
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Yep.

275
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Let's call it a day and go home.

276
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
And not before we go to our next word, to grab some freshies.

277
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,280
All right.

278
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,520
Grab us some freshies.

279
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Grab some freshies.

280
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay.

281
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Freshies.

282
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
What are these freshies?

283
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,760
Remember we talked about fresh powder?

284
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
It's that.

285
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
So, it's an informal way of saying fresh powder.

286
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah.

287
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Fresh powdery light snow.

288
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay.

289
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Freshies.

290
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Yep.

291
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,960
So, the snow that nobody has skied on before.

292
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,520
Really good phrases and some amazing vocabulary.

293
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

294
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:41,640
bit more about this really fun sport.

295
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,920
Welcome ski lovers of all ages.

296
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,360
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Thank you, Rick.

298
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,040
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12

299
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,720
inches of fresh powder.

300
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,000
It doesn't get much better than this.

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right, Bob.

302
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,640
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

303
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,560
We're joined here by Ian Russe, four-time Giant Slalom champion.

304
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

305
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
So, let's hit the slopes.

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,720
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

307
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,400
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

308
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
That's right.

309
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Now, snap them into your bindings.

310
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,680
And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

311
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,440
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

312
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have

314
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Easy there, Rick.

316
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,280
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

317
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:52,000
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns.

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,560
Gnarly run, Rick.

319
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Nice carving.

320
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
You've got some mad skills.

321
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,200
That was sick.

322
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You want to see gnarly?

323
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Well, see that bump over there?

324
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm going to catch some major air.

325
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Butt plant.

326
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,800
Ha ha ha, he lost his skis.

327
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Yard sale.

328
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,360
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

329
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,880
I think that about does it.

330
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,680
Bob, Ian, time for some aprÃ¨s-ski?

331
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
No way, man.

332
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:25,200
We're off to grab some freshies.

333
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,840
We heard the guys talk about aprÃ¨s-ski, and actually this is one of my favorite parts

334
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
of skiing.

335
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
What is this?

336
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
It sounds French.

337
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Yeah, it is.

338
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,240
I guess the Frenchness sort of gives it an air of specialness, right?

339
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,720
But aprÃ¨s-ski is basically the party that you have after you're finished skiing.

340
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,600
So usually you would have parties after skiing.

341
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Right, so you finish your ski day, you've called it a day, you've glided down those

342
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,560
slopes and you head on over to the lodge, the little cabin, grab a beer or two or maybe

343
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,760
some hot alcoholic drink and kick back and relax with your friends.

344
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,680
Wow, so it's popular for families to go to a ski resort and stay there for a couple of

345
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
days.

346
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,360
So this is when you would do this with your friends or family.

347
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
And you know what?

348
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
If it's with your friends, it's going to last until late into the night.

349
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
All right, so it sounds fun.

350
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,760
And next time maybe if you go skiing with your friends and you guys are speaking English

351
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,320
now, you can use all these great phrases and maybe surprise your friends if you tell them,

352
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
let's go grab some freshies or something like that.

353
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah, you'll sound pretty, pretty dialed, pretty cool.

354
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,360
All right, so that's all the time we have for today.

355
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,120
Be sure to check out our website englishpod.com.

356
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,440
Marco and I are always around to answer your questions and well, thanks for downloading.

357
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Until next time, goodbye.

358
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:50,720
Bye.
