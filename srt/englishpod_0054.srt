00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,560
And we're going to be looking at our fifth episode of our famous love story.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,360
Yes, I'm sorry I love you.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
Okay.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,360
Part five.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,960
So if you haven't listened to the first four, I suggest you go do that first because...

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,160
You're going to be a little bit lost.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,640
But it's getting really good.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Yeah, and so, so good that I don't think we can even say...

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
What's going to happen next.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,840
We can't say what the key language is.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,120
Yeah, we can't preview anything because we want to surprise you.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Yes.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
But we can tell you this.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
What's going on?

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,160
The last time we saw Veronica and Steven, they broke up, right?

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Right.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
And Veronica was with her friend and feeling really terrible.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,840
And then Steven suddenly came to sing a beautiful song.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,760
So this is continuing on that.

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Right.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Okay.

25
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,000
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about some of the difficult

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,120
vocabulary we might find.

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:14,080
Honey, of course I forgive you.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,560
I love you so much.

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,520
I've really missed you.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,560
I was wrong to get upset over nothing.

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm sorry I haven't called or anything.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,200
But right after you decided you wanted a break, I was up north to put out some major forest

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
fires.

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,040
I was in the middle of nowhere working day and night trying to prevent the blaze from

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
spreading.

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
It was pretty intense.

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,480
Oh, honey, I'm glad you're okay.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,360
But I have some exciting news.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,480
I think I'm pregnant.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Really?

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
Wow, that's amazing.

42
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
This is great news.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
I've always wanted to be a father.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:05,760
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,880
We have your test results back and indeed you are pregnant.

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Let's see here.

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,280
Everything seems to be in order.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,000
Your approximate due date is October 27, 2009, so that means the baby was conceived on February

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,680
3, 2009.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Are you sure?

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
Are these things accurate?

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,920
Well, yes, sir, they are.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
What's wrong?

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,160
Why are you asking me these questions?

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,600
This baby isn't mine.

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,720
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I...

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
I...

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
No.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,720
It can't be.

61
00:02:48,720 --> 00:03:03,000
All right, so more drama in our love story.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,760
Things were going well and now more bad news.

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Yeah, or good news.

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Or good news.

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
We're not sure yet.

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Yeah.

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,400
Okay, let's take a look at the vocabulary first in Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,760
Well, we're going to look at four words now.

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
The first one, blaze.

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Blaze.

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Blaze.

74
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Blaze.

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,600
So, this noun is another word for a fire, right?

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Or a big fire.

77
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,040
Yeah, a really big fire.

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
The blaze.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,560
So, basically, it's like the flame of the fire.

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Yes.

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,360
This one is a little bit difficult, so I think we can use some examples to show us how to

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,840
use this word.

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,680
Example one.

84
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,600
The blaze is spreading quickly.

85
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,400
We need to evacuate these people.

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,640
Example two.

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,080
We have to go in there and save those people from the blaze.

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,700
Okay, so it's clear now, blaze.

89
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,200
Let's look at our next word, conceived.

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,380
Conceived.

91
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,440
The past of conceive.

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Right, conceive.

93
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,160
Conceive is a nice fancy word.

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,960
Yes, and what does it mean, Marco?

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
To create.

96
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, like how you sidestepped around that one.

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,280
So, it means to create.

98
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,000
You can conceive a baby.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can conceive an idea.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,640
So, it basically means to create.

103
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,400
Yes, most commonly with the baby, though.

104
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,720
Yeah, yeah, conceive.

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,520
So, after the baby was conceived, we have a due date.

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Yes.

107
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,880
We all know that it's nine months later, approximately.

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
Yes, due dates.

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,040
So, the due date is the date of birth, basically.

110
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,840
It's the doctor's guess when the birth would be.

111
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Would be, okay.

112
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Yes.

113
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,440
When you go to the doctor and say, when will my baby be born?

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,560
He'll say, well, your due date is blah, blah, blah.

115
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Nine months later.

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Yes.

117
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Okay, and our last word in language takeaway, accurate.

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Accurate.

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Accurate.

120
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Accurate.

121
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,240
So, the due dates aren't accurate.

122
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
You're right.

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,880
That means they're not 100% sure or precise.

124
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Yes.

125
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,600
So, when something is accurate, it's absolutely certain.

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Absolutely precise.

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Yes.

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
100%.

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Okay, so accurate.

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,520
Let's listen to some more examples of how we can use accurate.

131
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,480
Example one.

132
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:39,520
A blood test is the most accurate way of finding out if you're pregnant.

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,280
Example two.

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,200
These reports are not accurate, John.

135
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,920
We checked and discovered a lot of mistakes.

136
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,280
Example three.

137
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,800
This new software helps us calculate costs in a very accurate way.

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
With those examples, I think we're ready to listen to this dialogue again.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
This time we're going to slow it down, right?

140
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,280
Yeah, in case you were so shocked by what happened that you couldn't follow.

141
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,120
Honey, of course I forgive you.

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
I love you so much.

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,400
I've really missed you.

144
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,680
Please forgive me.

145
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,600
I was wrong to get upset over nothing.

146
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm sorry I haven't called or anything, but right after you decided you wanted a break,

147
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,320
I was called up north to put out some major forest fires.

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,840
I was in the middle of nowhere, working day and night, trying to prevent the blaze from

149
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,040
spreading.

150
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,760
It was pretty intense.

151
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, honey.

152
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm glad you're okay, but I have some exciting news.

153
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,120
I think I'm pregnant.

154
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
Really?

155
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,960
Wow, that's amazing!

156
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
This is great news!

157
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,400
I've always wanted to be a father.

158
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,120
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,280
We have your test results back, and indeed, you are pregnant.

160
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's see here.

161
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,720
Everything seems to be in order.

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Your approximate due date is October 27th, 2009, so that means the baby was conceived

163
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,080
on February 3rd, 2009.

164
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,760
Are you sure?

165
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,000
Are these things accurate?

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,040
Well, yes sir, they are.

167
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,480
What's wrong?

168
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,500
Why are you asking these questions?

169
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,600
This baby isn't mine.

170
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,920
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

171
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I...

172
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I...

173
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,120
No, it can't be.

174
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,880
Alright, so continuing on with our drama, let's take a look at some interesting phrases

175
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,640
in Fluency Builder.

176
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,520
Well, we've got three phrases for you.

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,720
The first one is the middle of nowhere.

179
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
Middle of nowhere.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Middle of nowhere.

181
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Middle of nowhere.

182
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,760
This is a kind of a funny one, but I think if we listen to some examples, it will help

183
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,040
us to understand the meaning of this phrase.

184
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,000
Example one.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,600
We are in the middle of nowhere.

186
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,140
How can we find our way back home?

187
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,160
Example two.

188
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:49,280
I was in the middle of nowhere, so I couldn't even use my mobile phone.

189
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,960
Example three.

190
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,960
It takes me two hours to drive to your house.

191
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,400
It's in the middle of nowhere.

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,640
Alright, so middle of nowhere, it means that you are lost.

193
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,360
Yeah, you're in a place with no cities or people or anything nearby.

194
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,240
Okay, so just imagine yourself in a desert, that would be the middle of nowhere.

195
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
Yes, or in Canada.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Canada.

197
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
That would be the middle of nowhere.

198
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,800
Alright, let's take a look at our next phrase.

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
First thing in the morning.

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,280
First thing in the morning.

201
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
First thing in the morning.

202
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
First thing in the morning.

203
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,640
So when we talk about the first thing, it means...

204
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
Really really early in the morning.

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Really early.

206
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Yeah.

207
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,460
So I can change it a little bit and say, first thing in the afternoon.

208
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,680
Early in the afternoon.

209
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,880
Or first thing tomorrow morning.

210
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Right.

211
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Right?

212
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
So really early tomorrow.

213
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Okay.

214
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,680
So it's a very common way of referring to very early.

215
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,320
Yeah, it's not like first thing in the morning is like six o'clock in the morning, right?

216
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,120
But if you say, okay, I'll take care of that first thing in the morning, you'll do it right

217
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
away in the morning.

218
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Right away.

219
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,480
Right when you get to the office, for example.

220
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Right, yeah.

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Okay.

222
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,520
Let's look at our last phrase.

223
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,320
Seems to be in order.

224
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Seems to be in order.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,700
Everything seems to be in order.

226
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,440
So everything is okay.

227
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Everything's normal.

228
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,600
Everything seems to be normal.

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,200
Everything looks okay.

230
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,240
So this is a very common phrase when people check your documents or report.

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,840
They'll say, okay, all the papers seem to be in order.

232
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Very common.

233
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Yes.

234
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
Good news when you're pregnant that everything seems to be in order.

235
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Exactly.

236
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Everything is normal.

237
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,800
All right, so let's listen to this dramatic dialogue one more time and we'll come back

238
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,880
and talk some more.

239
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:54,080
Honey, of course I forgive you.

240
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
I love you so much.

241
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,520
I've really missed you.

242
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,560
I was wrong to get upset over nothing.

243
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
I'm sorry I haven't called or anything.

244
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,320
But right after you decided you wanted a break, I was up north to put out some major forest

245
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
fires.

246
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
I was in the middle of nowhere working day and night trying to prevent the blaze from

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
spreading.

248
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
It was pretty intense.

249
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,440
Oh, honey, I'm glad you're okay, but I have some exciting news.

250
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,520
I think I'm pregnant.

251
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Really?

252
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Wow, that's amazing.

253
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,880
This is great news.

254
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,960
I've always wanted to be a father.

255
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:45,760
You'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

256
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,880
We have your test results back and indeed, you are pregnant.

257
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,920
Let's see here.

258
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,320
Everything seems to be in order.

259
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,040
Our approximate due date is October 27, 2009, so that means the baby was conceived on February

260
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,720
3, 2009.

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,800
Are you sure?

262
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
Are these things accurate?

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,960
Well, yes, sir, they are.

264
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
What's wrong?

265
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,200
Why are you asking me these questions?

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
This baby isn't mine.

267
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,760
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

268
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I...

269
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I...

270
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
No.

271
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
It can't be.

272
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
It can't be.

273
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, Marco, what do you think about this situation?

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,960
What would you do if you were this guy?

275
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
It's complicated.

276
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I know.

277
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,620
Uh, I don't know what I would do.

278
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,440
It seems like something very typical of soap operas.

279
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes.

280
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,320
Well, I don't know because she didn't really deny it in the end.

281
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,440
She didn't say no right away.

282
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Yeah, but she didn't say like, oh.

283
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,080
Yeah, she didn't really accept it, so it's still a little bit difficult to see if maybe

284
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,440
she cheated on him or something.

285
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Hey, guys, what do you think?

286
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,520
Do you think Veronica cheated on Stephen?

287
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,880
Do you think it's his baby?

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Maybe it's not.

289
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Maybe the doctor is wrong.

290
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,080
Maybe it's the doctor's baby.

291
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
Maybe it's...

292
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,120

All right, guys, so until next time.

299
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Bye.

300
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:49,200
Independence.
