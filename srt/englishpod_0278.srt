00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,600
My name is Catherine and today we've got an intermediate level lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,480
Now Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
That's right.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,520
Today we're going to try to buy a new car.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,480
So we're going to the car dealer and we want to try and see if we can get a new car.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,120
Okay, so lots of great vocabulary for buying that car.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Let's check out today's dialogue.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,120
We'll be back in a moment.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,600
Hi there.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,800
I am looking for a new car.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,160
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,560
I see.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,160
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,440
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Perfect.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,800
I like this one.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,840
That is the Ford Focus, a very light but powerful vehicle.

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,160
It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,320
Sounds like a good car.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,240
How many miles to the gallon?

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,240
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle, giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
highway.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,840
That is really convenient, especially now that fuel prices are so high.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
What's under the hood?

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,760
A very powerful 2.5 liter turbocharged engine.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,080
Trust me, this car is fast.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,320
Now for the most difficult question.

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,120
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,440
Very affordable, ma'am.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,960
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,280
first year.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,640
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Great.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,760
Let's do it.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Alright we're back.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,760
So now we're going to take a look at some of that vocab, especially the one that the

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,520
salesman used on Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,800
Alright so at the beginning of this dialogue we hear a lot of features that this car has.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,480
The first one is trade in actually.

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,400
This is something that the man says when he goes to the car lot.

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
That's right.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
He says he has an old car.

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,840
He has a Ford Pinto and he wants to trade it in.

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,400
He wants to trade in his old car.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,720
So this is something that you do in America or other places when you have a car already

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
but you want a new car.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,760
And so the car lot, the place where you can buy the cars, they'll usually give you some

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,800
money for your old car and you can spend that money on your new car.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
That's right.

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,540
So basically you give them your old car plus some extra cash and then you can get a new

55
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,540
car.

56
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,400
So that's basically what a trade in is.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,160
And well as you said we had a lot of features on this car of the Ford Focus.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,520
First of all, dual side airbags.

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,560
Okay so dual side is pretty simple.

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,600
It means that you have them on both sides.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,160
The left and the right.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
Dual means two.

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,600
But airbags are what's important in this phrase.

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,260
Airbags do what exactly Marco?

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,180
They protect you from hitting the front part of the car.

66
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,240
So maybe out of the steering wheel a bag will inflate if you crash so it will prevent you

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,680
from hitting the steering wheel and getting hurt.

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,920
It's like a big balloon and it protects you from damaging your body.

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
That's right.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,080
So it has two airbags for the passenger and for the driver.

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,360
Alright so after that we also heard about a number of things that are power.

72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
Power steering, power windows.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,560
So what does power steering do?

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,600
Power steering or also called assisted steering, it allows you to turn your car with less effort.

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,560
So maybe you've driven a car that didn't have power steering and so you really have to struggle

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,760
when you're turning the car especially if you're parking.

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,880
So you have to turn the wheel and turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it to turn.

78
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,360
But a power steering makes it more automatic.

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
That's right.

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,080
So it's very easy to turn left or right.

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
That's right.

82
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
And the same thing goes for power windows.

83
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,980
So maybe your car doesn't have electric windows.

84
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,760
So you have to do it manually with a little lever.

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,720
To turn it around and around and around.

86
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,080
But instead with power windows you just push a button and the window goes down or up.

87
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
That's right.

88
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,800
And actually as well another feature for the windows we have tinted windows.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Now these are sometimes very popular.

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,160
I don't think I've ever had tinted windows on my car but tint means something is darker.

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,600
It's protected from the sun so tinted sunglasses for example can be very dark.

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,120
But tinted windows on a car are black.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
They don't let much sunlight in so you don't get blinded by the sun or so other people

94
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
can't see you from outside.

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,720
Usually limousines you will see all limousines have tinted windows.

96
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,680
Politicians like to drive around in cars with tinted windows.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
That's right.

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Okay.

99
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
So a lot of features there.

100
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
A lot of vocab regarding the car.

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
Why don't we take a break.

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

103
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:11,440
Then we'll be back to talk some more.

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Hi there.

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,320
I am looking for a new car.

106
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,880
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
I see.

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,880
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

109
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,200
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Perfect.

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,520
I like this one.

112
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
That is the Ford Focus.

113
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,560
A very light but powerful vehicle.

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,880
It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your

115
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,400
choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

116
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,040
Sounds like a good car.

117
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,960
How many miles to the gallon?

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the

119
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
highway.

120
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,520
That is really convenient especially now that fuel prices are so high.

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
What's under the hood?

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,480
A very powerful 2.5 liter turbocharged engine.

123
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Trust me, this car is fast.

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
Now for the most difficult question.

125
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,840
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

126
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
Very affordable ma'am.

127
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,680
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,020
first year.

129
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,320
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

130
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Great.

131
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,240
We'll be right back.

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
So now let's start again with Language Takeaway.

133
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,960
Now let's take a look at part two.

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Language Takeaway.

135
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,720
So a very, very key phrase that we heard in the dialogue is automatic or sometimes manual

136
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
transmission.

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,320
So automatic transmission, manual transmission.

138
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,160
This is very important when we talk about cars.

139
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
That's right.

140
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,160
So basically the car has a lot of gears and with an automatic transmission, the car will

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
basically change gears by itself.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Right.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,240
So you start in park and you go to drive and you can go to reverse, park, drive, reverse.

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,300
This controls kind of the way the car moves.

145
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,880
But with a manual transmission, this means you have to do it by yourself using your hand.

146
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
So we have what gears?

147
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
We have one, two, three, four, and sometimes five.

148
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
That's right.

149
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,680
So that's a manual transmission.

150
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,440
You have to change the gears manually.

151
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,520
It's a lot of work.

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,200
Now talking about another feature of the car, the client asked, well, how many miles to

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,240
the gallon does the car get?

154
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,400
And the salesman said that the car is very fuel efficient.

155
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Okay.

156
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,960
So this is a very important phrase right now as gas is very expensive in some parts of

157
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,760
the world and we're concerned about the environment, right?

158
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,960
So a fuel efficient car is a car that uses gas very well.

159
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,160
That means that I can go very, very far on one tank of gas.

160
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,820
I don't need to keep putting gas into my car.

161
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
That's right.

162
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,120
So usually, for example, sports cars are not fuel efficient.

163
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,360
Hummers are not fuel efficient.

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
That's right.

165
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,660
So fuel efficient is a key thing to look for these days.

166
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,920
But the customer also wanted to know what's under the hood.

167
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,300
So this phrase under the hood is very, very common when we're talking about cars.

168
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
That's right.

169
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,920
The person said, what's under the hood?

170
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,500
And basically what we're saying is what is under the hood, which is that metal cover

171
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,840
on the front part of the car.

172
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,320
So you lift that in there, you can have access to the engine.

173
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
So basically that's the question.

174
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,960
What kind of an engine does this car have?

175
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,560
Oftentimes when your car stops or you have a problem, like it's broken, someone like

176
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,680
a mechanic will say, hey, let's have a look, let's look under the hood.

177
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,600
He wants to know, let's look at the engine so we can find the problem.

178
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,280
But in this case, it's not a problem.

179
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,760
He just wants to know what kind of a car is this.

180
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,120
Is it powerful or is it not so powerful?

181
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
That's right.

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
That's exactly right.

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,500
So that's why we want to know what's under the hood.

184
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,100
And well, he goes on to explain all the features about the engine.

185
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,840
But then when we talk about the payment, how much the car costs, the salesman said, you

186
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
know what?

187
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
It's not expensive.

188
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,240
And on top of that, you can drive it out today with 0% down payment.

189
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,960
Okay, this is important.

190
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,320
Down payments are payments that you often make with very, very big ticket items, a house,

191
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
a car, things like this.

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,140
So a down payment is what you have to pay to get the thing.

193
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,120
To begin using it, but not all of the payment, right?

194
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Right.

195
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
So it's a percentage.

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,760
So if the car is $10,000 and the man says there's a 0% down payment, how much do I have

197
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
to pay Marco?

198
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Zero.

199
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Zero.

200
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
I don't pay anything today.

201
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,340
I pay in a month a little bit and then next month a little bit.

202
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,920
But if the payment is a 10% down payment, then I have to pay $1,000 today.

203
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
That's right.

204
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,040
So as you said, it's usually about things that have a big price tag that are very expensive,

205
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,160
a house, a car, these types of things.

206
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,200
Usually you need to give a down payment.

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
That means that you're committing to buying it.

208
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
That's right.

209
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,080
So a lot of interesting things going on in today's lesson.

210
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:19,680
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to talk some more.

211
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Hi there.

212
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,720
I am looking for a new car.

213
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,080
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

214
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
I see.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,080
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

216
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,440
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

217
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Perfect.

218
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
I like this one.

219
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,720
That is the Ford Focus, a very light but powerful vehicle.

220
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,040
It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your

221
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

222
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,200
Sounds like a good car.

223
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,120
How many miles to the gallon?

224
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,120
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle, giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the

225
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
highway.

226
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,680
That is really convenient, especially now that fuel prices are so high.

227
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
What's under the hood?

228
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,720
A very powerful 2.5 liter turbocharged engine.

229
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,880
Trust me, this car is fast.

230
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,320
Now for the most difficult question.

231
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,080
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

232
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,440
Very affordable, ma'am.

233
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,960
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the

234
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,280
first year.

235
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,480
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

236
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Great.

237
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,520
Let's do it.

238
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,120
All right, so buying a new car can always be tricky.

239
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,560
What do you prefer though, for example, in these types of features of the car?

240
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,680
For me, a car must be very fuel efficient because number one, cars are all bad for the

241
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,760
environment, so I want a car that's less bad for the environment.

242
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,680
But also, I really like manual transmission because number one, manual transmission is

243
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,400
more fuel efficient than automatic.

244
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,880
And also, I like to have more control when I'm driving.

245
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,720
I feel safer in a manual transition car because when you do manual, you actually pay more

246
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,880
attention to your driving.

247
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,340
You have to concentrate.

248
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,840
But automatic, you can think about other things and listen to the music.

249
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,600
So I think that that's a safety issue.

250
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
But what do you look for?

251
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,720
I know you're really, really into cars.

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Yeah, I actually prefer manual transmissions as well, most importantly because of the way

253
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,920
that the car drives, especially a sports car.

254
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,120
It's definitely something for me.

255
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,080
It's nice to have a manual transmission.

256
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,960
But also, little nice features like in the exterior, like the rims, I like nice rims

257
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,360
or maybe a nice paint job.

258
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,600
Tinted windows, I'm not a very big fan of tinted windows.

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,580
But yeah, I don't know.

260
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,440
Some cars nowadays, even for, as you said, politicians, they even sell them bulletproof.

261
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
That's right.

262
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
They have bulletproof glass.

263
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,720
Very, very secure.

264
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,480
Well, for me, I don't think I need bulletproof glass, but a good stereo is a good start.

265
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
That's right.

266
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Yeah.

267
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
You want to have good speakers and...

268
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,840
You can connect your iPod to the stereo now.

269
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Exactly.

270
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Exactly.

271
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
So a lot of great things with cars.

272
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,160
And actually, the model that they mentioned, the Ford Pinto, is a very popular but very

273
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
bad car.

274
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
It used to be...

275
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
It was cheap.

276
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,520
It was cheap, but it wasn't very good.

277
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,320
In the 1970s and 80s, this was a very common car.

278
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,320
And it's famous for being a small, cheap car.

279
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
That's right.

280
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
That's right.

281
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
It was a very cheap car.

282
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Yes, exactly.

283
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,520
So maybe you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and you can tell us if you have a car, what

284
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
was your first car?

285
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,280
And did you buy a new car or a used car?

286
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
That's right.

287
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Secondhand cars.

288
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
So let us know.

289
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,920

Good drive.
