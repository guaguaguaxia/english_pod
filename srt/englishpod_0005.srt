00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,400
All right, Amira is here today and she is going to tell us about the wonderful lesson

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,840
she has prepared this time.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,360
Well, thank you, Marco.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,880
Well, today we have a very interesting lesson prepared for you.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,200
It's about someone cutting in line.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,640
Cutting in line, okay.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, it happens all the time and we all get very upset about it but, you know, it happens.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,160
Right, right.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,840
Well, I imagine that everyone is wondering what cutting in line is.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,920
Why don't we just listen to the dialogue one time and then when we come back Amira and

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,040
I will gladly explain all the vocabulary in this dialogue.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Let's listen.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:01:01,000
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,880
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,840
Yeah, but just relax honey.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,880
We're here and we're going on vacation.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,760
In a few hours we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,120
Oh no, look at that line.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,320
It must be a mile long.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,440
There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,360
Honey, don't.

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,920
Hey man, the end of the line is over there.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Yeah.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,120
No, seriously, I was here first and you can't cut in line like this.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Says who?

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
I do.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
So sue me.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Alright, that's it.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Whoa, I think there's punching.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,880
Yeah, I guess this guy was just a crazy, I don't know, impatient man, huh?

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,440
Yes, yes, but we don't want to talk about this now.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,680
But for now, we will treat some of the vocabulary and very useful phrases in the dialogue.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Great.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,440
So, Marco, do you want to start?

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Yes.

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,760
Let's take a look at our first word would be unbelievable.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Unbelievable.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Unbelievable.

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Unbelievable.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Unbelievable.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,720
Unbelievable. Exactly, and just how you say it, it's something

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,920
incredible, something amazing.

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah, but I would like to point out that unbelievable was used here to describe the man's frustration.

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,880
He's not happy about the traffic in New York.

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Exactly.

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Perfect.

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,320
Okay, in the next part, the woman, she's trying to calm and relax her husband.

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,680
And she says that they'll be in Hawaii in a few hours and you'll be on the golf course.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Right.

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,280
So, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,680
Yes, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,800
So, this is a great way of talking about your physical location in the future.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Right.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,680
So, for example, Amira, tomorrow where will you be?

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Don't worry, Marco, I'll be in the office tomorrow.

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
Perfect, right?

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,760
That's where I need you to be.

61
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Yes.

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Okay.

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,760
All right, well, I have another interesting phrase here for you.

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,600
Must be a mile long.

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,320
A mile long.

66
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,040
A mile long.

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
A mile long.

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:29,760
Now, that's basically not a mile, it's not a kilometer long, but it's another way of

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,280
saying that this line is really, really long.

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,040
Right, it's just an exaggeration.

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,680
Now let's take a look at there's no way.

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,240
There's no way.

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
There's no way.

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,120
There's no way.

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Perfect.

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,800
Let's listen to some other examples on how we use there's no way in a different situation

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:04:03,040
and then we can come back and talk about it a little bit more.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:13,640
There's no way I can have those reports finished today.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:27,000
The stadium is so crowded that there's no way we'll find a seat.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
Do you think Michael's going to buy that house?

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:38,200
There's no way he has enough money to buy it.

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
All right, everyone.

83
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
So there's no way is another way of saying it is impossible.

84
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,280
Exactly.

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,760
There's no way you should miss this podcast, right?

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Yes.

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Well, I have another phrase for you as well.

88
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,480
Cut in line.

89
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
Cut in line.

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,280
Cut in line.

91
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,040
Cut in line.

92
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,640
Cut in line.

93
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,240
So again, we have some really good examples on how you could use this phrase in different

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
situations.

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:18,960
Let's listen to the examples and then we can come back and talk about it some more.

96
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,680
Excuse me, I'm really late.

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:29,280
Can I cut in line, please?

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,720
I hate it when people cut in line at the bank.

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
It's so rude.

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,960
I think it's okay when a pregnant woman cuts in line.

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
All right, everyone.

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
Cut in line.

103
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Right.

104
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,560
So from the examples, we can understand that it means when you are standing in line somewhere

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
and somebody gets in front of you.

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Right.

107
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
I have another phrase for you here.

108
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,760
Sue me.

109
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
Sue me.

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,320
Sue me.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Sue me.

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Okay.

113
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,520
Now, sue me is not a nice phrase.

114
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,880
If you hear that, you know you're in trouble.

115
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,960
Yeah, it's kind of rude, I guess, to say, sue me.

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Right.

117
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,400
Well, it actually means like taking someone to court and asking for money because someone

118
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,760
has harmed you in a way.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:31,840
I think that we should listen to the dialogue one more time and try to figure out why he

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:44,680
used that phrase and if he's really going to take him to court.

121
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,520
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

122
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,400
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Yeah, but just relax, honey.

124
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,440
We're here and we're going on vacation.

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,360
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

126
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Oh, no.

127
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Look at that line.

128
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,880
It must be a mile long.

129
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,000
There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Honey, don't.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,480
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there.

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Yeah.

133
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,680
No, seriously, I was here first and you can't cut in line like this.

134
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Says who?

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
I do.

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
So, sue me.

137
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,680
All right, that's it.

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,600
All right, we're back.

139
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,840
Now, this guy, when he says sue me, he's just being rude.

140
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I mean, he's just being kind of impolite and telling him, I don't care.

141
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Right, exactly.

142
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,600
Like, you can't do anything about it.

143
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah.

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah.

145
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Okay.

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,080
Today in the studio, we have a guest.

147
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,960
Her name is Sarah and she's from England.

148
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,560
Hi there.

149
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Hello.

150
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,880
All right.

151
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,200
So, we're going to be asking her a couple of questions and she'll be a frequent guest

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,280
on our show, so you can expect to hear from her a lot.

153
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,760
Well, she didn't know that.

154
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
Yeah, it's a surprise.

155
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,200
She knows now.

156
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,520
Well, Sarah, our topic today is about jumping the queue.

157
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Okay, Amira, wait.

158
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
What is this jump the queue?

159
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,560
It's the same as cut in line, but in British English.

160
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,920
Ah, okay.

161
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,040
Yes, queuing is very important in England.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,400
We're very proud of our queues.

163
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,520
It's true.

164
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,760
So what would be the reaction of people if they cut in line?

165
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,560
I think we do take it very seriously.

166
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm laughing now, but it's quite serious.

167
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,960
So you don't dump the queue.

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:48,040
If people jump in front of you, you get a little tuts and you shouldn't be doing that.

169
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,520
We make it very obvious.

170
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,400
So you say it out loud?

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,520
We would, you know, perhaps say something.

172
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,360
And we have systems, you know, in London on the Metro, on the underground, you have to

173
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
stand on the escalators on the right and queue, and you can't jump in front.

174
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,600
You have to walk on the left and queue on the right.

175
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
And it's all very serious.

176
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,080
There's rules and regulations.

177
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Is there like a queue handbook that you have to read in high school and kind of take a

178
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
test on?

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Perhaps there should be.

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
There should be, yeah.

181
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Wow.

182
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
What about New York, Marco?

183
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,640
Well, no, definitely, I guess this dialogue is similar to a reality of New York.

184
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,600
If somebody gets in front of you or cuts the line, somebody is going to say something and

185
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,720
probably end up in a fight if the guy is rude.

186
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah.

187
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Oh my God.

188
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Yeah.

189
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,360
Well, Sarah, why don't you tell us, is there a line or a queue for almost everything in

190
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
England?

191
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
It seems like we do just like to form a queue.

192
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Yeah.

193
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
So, you know.

194
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Can you think of like some other examples of where you would normally you wouldn't queue,

195
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
but you do?

196
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Oh, gosh.

197
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Things like in the supermarket when you're trying to find some vegetables or something,

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,600
I'd never push, I'd never sort of reach around or anything.

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,400
I'd just wait until that person had finished picking up their stuff and then go in.

200
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,120
So, just try and...

201
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,680
So if like five people want to buy oranges at the supermarket, then you have a little

202
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,120
mini queue of five people waiting.

203
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
There's no sort of just shoving through to the front.

204
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,960
You just don't do that.

205
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
So you don't stick your hand out and grab like a tomato.

206
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:36,400
If you do, again, you would make sure that that person knows, oh, I'm sorry, I'm just

207
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
in a hurry or whatever.

208
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,680
But yeah, it's just letting someone go before you.

209
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
It's a courtesy, I think.

210
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Okay.

211
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It's quite important to us.

212
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
All right.

213
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Well, thank you so much, Sarah.

214
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
It was a pleasure.

215
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,360
Yeah, we'll have you back very soon.

216
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,760
So, all right, we're out of time, but we'll be back tomorrow with another lesson.

217
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,320

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
And you should definitely leave your suggestions.

222
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,680
But for now, I wish you all well and bye.
