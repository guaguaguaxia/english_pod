00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,680
And today we're bringing you the third part of this series that we've created called I'm

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,200
Sorry I Love You.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
That's right.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
The third part in our story about our EnglishPod couple.

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
Yeah, it's a romantic series, but today we're bringing you an argument.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
That's right.

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,760
Like in every relationship, you have fights, you have discussions, so we're going to teach

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,400
you how to do that in English.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
That's right.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,080
And in today's lesson, you'll learn some great language that people use when they get into

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,160
an argument with their boyfriend or girlfriend.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Right.

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,800
So why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,080
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
We have one phrase today.

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,140
Get a hold.

21
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,140
Get a hold.

22
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,180
Get a hold.

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,600
To get a hold.

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
To get a hold of someone means...

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,880
To try and communicate with that person.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Exactly.

27
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,120
So to try and call that person.

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,400
For example, I can say, I've been calling his phone all day, but I can't get a hold

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,560
of him.

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,720
Or I could say, finally, Marco, I got a hold of you.

31
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,320
Where have you been all day?

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
Exactly.

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Now we're going to listen to our dialogue and as always, it's going to be at a normal

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,360
pace, but you don't have to worry about it.

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:32,920
We'll come back and teach you all of the important words.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:44,040
There was an emergency at work, so...

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's just that I...

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,160
Come on, Veronica.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,480
That's not fair.

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,800
I do care about you a lot.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
You know that.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I try to...

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
You know what?

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,480
Maybe we should just take a break.

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,300
But Veronica, would you listen to me?

49
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:28,080
There was a fire alarm at my office building today and I was...

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,280
Okay so a little bit of trouble in the relationship.

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Yeah, that's too bad.

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,800
Yeah, well, I think she's overreacting.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
You do?

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
We'll talk about that later on.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,400
But we saw some great words and phrases here, so it's time for Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
Today on Language Takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
The first word is, stood me up.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,680
Stood me up.

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,480
Stood me up.

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,680
Stood me up.

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,880
The phrase, stand someone up, when do we use this?

63
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,480
If, for example, you have a date and you don't go.

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,280
Okay, so let's say you and I were supposed to have dinner together and you just didn't

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,920
come and didn't call.

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
Right, so I stood you up.

67
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Okay.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Stand someone up.

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Our next word, priorities.

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Priorities.

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Priorities.

72
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,040
So, priorities are something that's really important in your life.

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,120
That's right, like family or maybe work or making a lot of money or whatever it is.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
What are your priorities in life, right?

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
Right, yeah.

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Okay.

77
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,960
And our last word for Language Takeaway, heading.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Heading.

79
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Heading.

80
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Heading.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,200
This is a bit of a funny verb.

82
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,440
So let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used so we can understand its meaning.

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Example one.

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:02,800
I don't know where our relationship is heading.

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,160
Example two.

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,800
Where's this bus heading?

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,040
Example three.

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,240
Where's this project heading?

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,320
So basically heading means going.

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Exactly.

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,160
A heading is where you're going.

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Yep.

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,440
Okay, easy word and interesting.

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Okay so now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,560
It's going to be slower so now we can understand the words that we just talked about.

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,520
Stephen, where have you been?

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,160
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,520
There was an emergency at work so...

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,920
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours and you didn't even have the decency

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
to call me.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,840
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
It's just that I...

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Yeah, right.

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,600
I've heard it all before.

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
This is the fifth time you've stood me up in two weeks.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
You need to get your priorities straight.

109
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

110
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,360
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

111
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,960
I do care about you a lot.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,120
You know that.

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,640
I tried.

114
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,920
You know what?

115
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,120
Maybe we should just take a break.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,320
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

117
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,400
But Veronica, would you just listen to me?

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:00,360
There was a fire alarm at my office building today and I was stuck...

119
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,920
Okay now we saw some interesting phrases in dialogue.

120
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,080
Yeah, we saw some great phrases that people use when they're getting in a fight.

121
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,560
Why don't we take a look at some of them in Fluency Builder?

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,600
The first phrase that I want to take a look at today is, do you have any idea?

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Do you have any idea?

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
Do you have any idea?

126
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,520
This is a great way to set up an argument.

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,040
So let's listen to some examples of how you would set up an argument using this phrase.

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Example one.

129
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
You forgot my birthday.

130
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,920
Do you have any idea how angry I am?

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Example two.

132
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,240
Julie kissed my boyfriend.

133
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,080
Does she have any idea how mean that was?

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Example three.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

136
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,240
Don't you have any idea how sad I am?

137
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
So it's a great phrase to make that person understand that you were really worried or

138
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
really angry.

139
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Really angry.

140
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Okay.

142
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,200
And now the second phrase that we can take a look at is, I've heard it all before.

143
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,840
I've heard it all before.

144
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,400
I've heard it all before.

145
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,440
I've heard it all before.

146
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,960
So this is a great phrase of just saying, you don't have to give me an excuse.

147
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,720
I know what you're going to say.

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Exactly.

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,320
And our last phrase today, take a break.

150
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
Take a break.

151
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,780
Take a break.

152
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,760
So when a couple takes a break, they sort of stop their relationship, right?

153
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
They're breaking up.

154
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Yeah.

155
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
But is it really like forever?

156
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,120
Like a breakup that lasts forever?

157
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,760
Not, well, maybe.

158
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,200
It could be forever, but they're saying, let's just take some time away from each other for

159
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,680
a couple of days or weeks.

160
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Yeah, yeah.

161
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
And see what happens.

162
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Yes.

163
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Take a break.

164
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Take a break.

165
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Okay.

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
So our happy couple is going to take a break.

167
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Well, I guess they're not that happy then, hey?

168
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay.

169
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,760
So let's listen to their dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

170
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Stephen, where have you been?

171
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:21,760
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

172
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I, uh, there was an emergency at work, so...

173
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,760
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours, and you didn't even have the

174
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
decency to call me.

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

176
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
It's just that I...

178
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Yeah, right.

179
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
I've heard it all before.

180
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

181
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,760
This is the fifth time you stood me up in two weeks.

182
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
You need to get your priorities straight.

183
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,760
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

184
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Come on, Veronica.

185
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
That's not fair.

186
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
I do care about you a lot.

187
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
You know that.

188
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
I try to...

189
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
You know what?

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Maybe we should just take a break.

191
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,760
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

192
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
But, Veronica, would you listen to me?

193
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,760
There was a fire alarm at my office building today, and I was...

194
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:22,760
So, Marco, this phrase, to take a break, really reminds me of a Friends episode.

195
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Yeah, that really famous Friends episode when Ross and Rachel were on a break.

196
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,760
And Ross, like, went with another girl, right?

197
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Yeah, and then they definitely broke up after that.

198
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Yeah.

199
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
So that's one of the key issues, right?

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
If you're taking a break, can you start to date someone else?

201
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
I've got to agree with Rachel.

202
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Really?

203
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Yeah. No, you can't.

204
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
You can't?

205
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
So what's the point of taking a break?

206
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
You need some time away.

207
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You need some time to think.

208
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
But you're not really broken up.

209
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Exactly.

210
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
That's convenient.

211
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I don't know.

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
They were on a break.

213
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
I agree with Ross.

214
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Well, you would, wouldn't you?

215
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
All right, guys.

216
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
We're out of time today.

217
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I hope you enjoyed our lesson, and be sure to listen next time because we will definitely have a part four to this.

218
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Yes.

219
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Coming out soon.

220
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Yep.

221
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
And also come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

222
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Yeah, Marco and I are always happy to hear from you, and we love answering your questions.

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Right, and maybe you can tell us what you think happens in the fourth part.

224
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah.

225
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Okay.

226
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Well, until then, it's...

227
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Goodbye.

228
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Bye.

229
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Bye.

230
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Bye.

231
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Bye.
