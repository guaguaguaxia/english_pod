00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,360
Hi guys, my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,640
And today we're going to be looking at another lesson as part of our sports series and this

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,080
time, well it's a debate.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,320
Is it a game or is it a sport?

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,580
Oh, it's a sport.

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,880
You have to work your mind.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,920
Yeah, so we're looking at chess, a very old, very popular sport, very difficult to play

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
as well.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
It takes a lot of practice and believe me, it's frustrating at the beginning and I'm

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,160
still kind of in the beginning and intermediate stages.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,640
But yeah, it takes a lot of practice and it takes a lot of time to familiarize yourself

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
with the rules.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Right.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,600
So we're going to be learning a little bit more about the pieces and the rules today.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,680
Okay, perfect.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
So we're not going to preview anything.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and talk about

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
the sport.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Bobby, come here.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,640
Look what I got you.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
What is that?

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
A chess board.

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Cool.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Okay.

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Each player gets 16 pieces.

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,280
Now in the front, you set up the pawns.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,960
Those are the least viable pieces and can only move one space forward.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,280
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,720
What about all these other pieces?

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
See this one?

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,240
It looks like a tower.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
It's called the rook.

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,880
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,740
See this little horsey?

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,440
This is called the knight.

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,600
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
And these two?

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
They are husband and wife.

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,800
That's right.

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
That's the queen and that's the king.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,520
If the other player captures your king, he will say, checkmate, and the game is over.

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Doesn't this sound fun?

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,800
Nah, this sounds boring.

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm going to go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation.

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
All right.

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
So the kid is obviously not very interested in learning how to play chess.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Not at all.

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,560
You know, the arts of these kind of slower games might be replaced very soon by video

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
games.

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,360
It doesn't really appeal to a little nine-year-old or ten-year-old instead of, you know, playing

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,000
something like this versus, yeah, shooting.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
But it's a very great game.

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
It's very difficult, like we mentioned.

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,920
So we're going to look at the name of the pieces and the rules that are related to these

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,960
pieces in Language Takeaway.

61
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,440
Language Takeaway.

62
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Well, the first one you might have heard before because this is a word that is often used

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,520
in strategy in general.

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,000
So the word pawn.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,040
A pawn.

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,560
A pawn usually means something that is not very important that you can use to distract

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
an opponent.

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
All right.

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,060
So on the chessboard, you have eight pawns.

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,360
So these are the ones that you have the most, but their movement is very limited.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,840
So they can only move two spaces forward on the first move, right?

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Right.

73
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
Or one space after that.

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,640
One space forward.

75
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,520
And only when it's going to capture another piece can it move diagonally.

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
All right.

77
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,600
So you can't just go diagonally.

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,620
You have to go forward until you're going to take another person's piece to capture

79
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,920
it and to go diagonally.

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,000
All right.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,240
But a pawn is funny.

82
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,000
You can also use this word when you're talking about other things like, he used her as a

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
pawn in his little game.

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,640
So you want to make an analogy.

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,160
You want to make a comparison from life to these games.

86
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,880
You can use the word pawn.

87
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Pawn.

88
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Very good.

89
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
So let's go to the other pieces on the chessboard.

90
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,160
On the very far ends of the board, you have the rook.

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Okay.

92
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,640
You've got two of these and they kind of look like towers from a castle.

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,480
And it's a very, well, they're very important pieces and actually my favorite pieces because

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,000
they're not very important at the beginning of a game, but at the end of a game, boom,

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,720
boom, boom, you can do a lot of damage because they can go anywhere in straight lines.

96
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Right.

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,400
So they can go forward, backwards, and to the sides, as many spaces as they want.

98
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
The whole board.

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
The whole board.

100
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Yeah.

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,880
So easy, easy pieces to forget about at the beginning, but they're very important.

102
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,240
And now next to the rook, we have the bishop.

103
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Okay.

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,160
This is very different from the rook because the bishop can also go anywhere, but they

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,960
can only go diagonally.

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Right.

107
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,680
So only diagonally.

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,640
They can also move four directions, but diagonally, right?

109
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Exactly.

110
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,360
So you can go forward and backward, but it has to be in a diagonal slanted line.

111
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay.

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,520
And now next to the bishop, we have the knight.

113
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,040
Ooh, the knight.

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,280
So he's the one galloping on the horse, like those old stories of King Arthur we used to

115
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
hear.

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,400
But the knight can go in an L shape and I've never understood this, but.

117
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
It's weird.

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,880
So it can move two spaces forward and then one to the right or one to the left, or it

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,600
can move two spaces to the right and then one forward.

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,840
So it's very strange, but it always has to move three spaces and in the shape of an L.

121
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
So I thought maybe he was the drunken piece.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
He can go forward a little bit, then he kind of moves to the side.

123
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Right.

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
So that's the knight.

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
It's actually a very, very important piece as well.

126
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,240
And now the two main pieces maybe of the chessboard, the queen and king.

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,720
So the king is kind of sad.

128
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,760
He can only move one space, but the queen is really the killer because she can do anything

129
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
she wants.

130
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
This is interesting, right?

131
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,880
Why do they make it like that?

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,600
The queen can move as many spaces as she wants in any direction, while the king can do the

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,880
same in any direction he wants, but only one space.

134
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,600
I think there's some similarity between real life now.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,920
It's like the queen can do anything she wants and the king can kind of do whatever he wants.

136
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,600
Well maybe it has to do with the fact that he has to stay put and represent the country

137
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,640
and she can move around and move behind the scenes and has a little bit more mobility.

138
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Maybe.

139
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Who knows?

140
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Yeah.

141
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,480
But in the end, the most important piece is the king, right?

142
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,840
Once the king is captured, the game is over.

143
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Exactly.

144
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,760
So let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and slow it down a bit and find out if

145
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,640
the boy understood any of these rules.

146
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Bobby, come here.

147
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Look what I got you.

148
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
What is that?

149
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
A chessboard.

150
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

151
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Cool.

152
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Okay.

153
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Each player gets 16 pieces.

154
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,640
You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces.

155
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Now in the front, you set up the pawns.

156
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Those are the least viable pieces and can only move one space forward.

157
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,640
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

158
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
What about all these other pieces?

159
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
See this one that looks like a tower?

160
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
It's called the rook.

161
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,640
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

162
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
See this little horsey?

163
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
This is called the knight.

164
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,640
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

165
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
And these two?

166
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
They are husband and wife.

167
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
That's right.

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
That's the queen and that's the king.

169
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,640
If the other player captures your king, he will say, checkmate, and the game is over.

170
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Doesn't this sound fun?

171
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Nah.

172
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
This sounds boring.

173
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm going to go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation.

174
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
All right, we're back.

175
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,640
And now why don't we explain a couple of these phrases that we also use to explain the pieces.

176
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,640
But let's look at some of these more in depth now in Fluency Builder.

177
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:57,640
So, Marco, one of the first phrases that we heard was the phrase to move diagonally or a diagonal line.

178
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,640
So, the pawns can sometimes do this and the bishop can do this, but what does it mean to move diagonally?

179
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Okay, so basically a diagonal line is not a line that goes straight up, right?

180
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Straight up to the sky, for example, or to the side, right?

181
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:22,640
It goes at an angle, so it's maybe going at 45 degrees or 30 degrees, so that's a diagonal movement or a diagonal line.

182
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,640
The next phrase we have is very strange, and this one you might hear from parents or children.

183
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
It says a little horsey.

184
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Little horsey.

185
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:41,640
So, in many languages we have ways of breaking down words or adding to words to make them sound cuter, and this is one of those cases.

186
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:48,640
So, for example, little puppy or little kitty or kitten, these are words to make things sound cuter.

187
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
So, in this case, horse becomes horsey.

188
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Horsey.

189
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
So, I want to ride the horsey.

190
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,640
It's a cute way of saying I want to ride the cute horse.

191
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Mommy, mommy, I want to ride the horsey.

192
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Exactly.

193
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,640
So, baby talk often involves having these rhyming words.

194
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Mommy, horsey, doggy, puppy.

195
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
A doggy, exactly. Very good.

196
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,640
So, it's a cute way of saying something.

197
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:22,640
And now, when we were talking about the chess pieces, when another piece takes or gets a piece, you say it captures it.

198
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Okay. We say capture because, well, maybe it's a bit nicer than killing it, but capture means taking and keeping for yourself.

199
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
So, we have a very popular game in America called capture the flag.

200
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Right. It's where you have to take each other's flag, right?

201
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
You're stealing, essentially.

202
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
You're stealing.

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,640
So, yeah, this is the term that is used in chess to capture another piece.

204
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Sometimes, like, for example, in Spanish, we actually say, like, to eat the other piece.

205
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Really?

206
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Yeah, you eat it.

207
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Weird.

208
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
That's weird.

209
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Well, we're a little bit more tame in those English-speaking countries, but to capture is a very important phrase,

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,640
and you're going to hear that in the news as well because you can capture a person.

211
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
You can capture a criminal.

212
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,640
All right, and the final word and the way that you end a game of chess, you say checkmate.

213
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Checkmate.

214
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Checkmate.

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Checkmate.

216
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
So, the game's over. Checkmate.

217
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Well, there's two things that can happen at the end of a game, and, well, only one thing can happen at the very end of a game,

218
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
but you're going to hear these two phrases.

219
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
One is check, and the other is checkmate.

220
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
So, check means that I can take your king if I want to. Move.

221
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Right. It's in danger.

222
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,640
It's in danger, but checkmate is the end all.

223
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
It means this is the very, very last part of a game where you cannot do anything.

224
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
I've trapped you, and I win.

225
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Right. Very good.

226
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,640
So, the game is over when somebody says checkmate.

227
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time,

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this very interesting game.

229
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Bobby, come here. Look what I got you.

230
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
What is that?

231
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
A chessboard.

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

233
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Cool.

234
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Okay. Each player gets 16 pieces.

235
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,640
You can be the white ones, and I'll play with the black pieces.

236
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Now, in the front, you set up the pawns.

237
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Those are the least viable pieces and can only move one space forward.

238
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,640
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

239
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
What about all these other pieces?

240
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,640
See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook.

241
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,640
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

242
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,640
See this little horsey? This is called the knight.

243
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,640
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

244
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,640
And these two? They are husband and wife.

245
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,640
That's right. That's the queen, and that's the king.

246
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,640
If the other player captures your king, he will say checkmate, and the game is over.

247
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Doesn't this sound fun?

248
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Nah, this sounds boring. I'm going to go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation.

249
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Pop quiz, Marco.

250
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
All right.

251
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,640
The word check and the word mate, they both have meanings in English,

252
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,640
but put together, where does this phrase come from? What could it possibly mean?

253
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I have no idea. Why don't you tell us? Because I seriously don't know where it comes from.

254
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Okay, well, this is actually very interesting, because I looked it up, and I had no idea either,

255
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,640
because we've always just said this, and it doesn't really make sense.

256
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,640
So I looked it up on the Internet, and I discovered that the game of chess is actually a very ancient game.

257
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,640
And it did not come from England, it did not come from France, it actually came from Persia.

258
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,640
And in Persian, there are some words that kind of became the English words checkmate

259
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,640
that mean the king is captured or the king is defeated.

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Okay, so that's what it means. It doesn't mean the king is dead.

261
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
No, it doesn't mean that he's dead, it means that he's been taken.

262
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:00,640
And so over time, the Persian word went into Arabic, and Arabic became French and English,

263
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
and then now we say checkmate.

264
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Checkmate, okay, interesting.

265
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:11,640
This is a very interesting word, and I'm sure everybody that's listening has a different translation for it in their own language.

266
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I know, for example, that in Spanish, we would say jaque mate.

267
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Jaque mate.

268
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Right, so I guess like jaque is something's in check, it's in danger, and then mate, kind of like kill.

269
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:30,640
So maybe it's probably not translated properly, because as you mentioned, it should mean defeated or captured, not killed.

270
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,640
So listeners, why don't you let us know how you say checkmate in your language?
