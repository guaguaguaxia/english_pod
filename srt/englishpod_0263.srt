00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,980
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about where people come from or nationalities.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,980
That's right.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,880
Many people come from many different countries just like our listeners and there are specific

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,200
words or adjectives and nouns to describe people.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,320
Like for example, somebody who is from China.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,440
A Chinese person.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
That's right.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,360
So in your case, Marco, you are an Ecuadorian.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
That's right.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,720
So that means I come from the country Ecuador.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,200
I, on the other hand, am an American.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
I come from America.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
That's right.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
So we have a lot of these examples.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,600
Why don't we jump into the dialogue.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,760
Let's see where all of the people from this international class are from and we'll be

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:55,600
back to talk about it.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,160
Hey how was your first day of class?

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm a level two and I'm loving my class this semester.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,720
It's great being in a class of international students.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,020
Mine was okay except that no one in my class speaks English.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,480
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,340
a lot this semester.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,560
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,680
It's the United Nations in my class.

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,120
We have people from all over the world.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,160
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scot, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean,

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,080
a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Who else do we have?

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,360
Oh we have a Moroccan, a Tagolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,040
That's quite the array of nationalities.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,960
Everyone in my class is from Asia except me.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:55,440
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani,

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
and one Russian.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Well I think you're pretty lucky actually.

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,720
You have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,160
I guess so but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,400
the language barrier.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,120
I think I might change classes.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't stay the course.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,960
Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,280
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,200
I highly doubt it.

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,880
Well there is that, yes.

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,620
So the student jokes that their class is kind of like the United Nations.

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
So it does sound like it.

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,200
We have so many different nationalities that we're going to look at them in two groups

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,360
today.

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,000
But the United Nations as you know is a political group that has people from all over the world

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,760
who make decisions about politics and the environment, things like that.

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
That's right.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,800
So why don't we take a look at these nationalities now on Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,880
Language Takeaway.

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,080
The first few are from Europe.

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,800
So these are some European nationalities.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
We've got German.

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
Where is a German from?

61
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
A German is from Germany.

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,200
Okay, so next to Germany we have another country, Poland.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,320
What do we call a person from Poland?

64
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,680
You call that person a Pole.

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,280
So is this for a woman and a man or is this just one gender?

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Yeah, it's for both.

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Okay, so Pole.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Yeah, a girl that's from Poland would be also a Pole.

69
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,160
Now someone that comes from Scotland on the other hand.

70
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,520
That would be a Scot or if it's a man, a Scotsman.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,720
Scotsman, okay.

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Now this is interesting because we are mentioning the nouns of these nationalities like for

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,480
example German.

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,840
Now when we took a look at Pole from Poland, what would be the adjective?

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,480
Do I say I am Pole?

76
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
I am Polish.

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,680
Or if you want to use the noun, I am a Pole.

78
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
But the adjective can be used for things as well.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,320
I love to eat Polish sausages.

80
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:06,480
Or for example or something from Scotland, you can say I love Scottish whiskey.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,440
Or I love Scottish kilts, those skirts.

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,800
Alright, so that's the adjective.

83
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,600
But in the case of France, the country France, we have to say as a noun, he is a Frenchman.

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Okay, and if it's a woman, a Frenchwoman.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,880
That's right or in the case of an adjective, I love to eat French bread.

86
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Okay.

87
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,040
Now moving on to South America, we took a look at a Brazilian and a Chilean.

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,440
Okay, so Brazil, Brazilian.

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,120
In this country, there are many Brazilians.

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:45,140
And Chile or Chile as many Americans say, has people called Chileans.

91
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Some people say Chilean.

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,280
So I don't know, I guess the accent varies a little bit.

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,000
Now why don't we move back to the other side of the world.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
We have a New Zealander.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,840
Alright, so many of you have heard of Australia.

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
Maybe New Zealand is not as famous.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,100
It's a small country near Australia.

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,320
And the people who come from there are called New Zealanders.

99
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,880
It's very hard to say those sometimes, especially when we have to use the adjective New Zealand.

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
That's right.

101
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,600
So the student said he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
Alright, so Kiwi was a special kind of bird that could only be found in New Zealand.

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,360
And so this became a very popular symbol for New Zealand.

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
And now people from New Zealand call themselves Kiwis.

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
So I could say I have many Kiwi friends.

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
That's right.

107
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
Okay, Kiwis.

108
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,520
So now if we go to the African continent, we have Moroccan and Togolese.

109
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,000
So Morocco is in North Africa and a person who comes from there is Moroccan.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,440
You can also say I like to eat Moroccan food, which is very popular.

111
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,560
But when we talk about the country Togo, what do we call a person from that country?

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Togolese.

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Togolese.

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
So it's Togo.

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
That's the way you pronounce it.

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Because if you look at it, I would say Togo.

117
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Right?

118
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
But it's not Togo.

119
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
It's Togo.

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,800
Or as my French-speaking friends would say, Togo.

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
That's right.

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,120
Alright, so that's our first set of nationalities.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and we'll be back in a moment to discuss

124
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,280
the other nationalities.

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:24,800
Hey, how was your first day of class?

126
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm a level two and I'm loving my class this semester.

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,320
It's great being in a class of international students.

128
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,640
Mine was okay, except that no one in my class speaks English.

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,080
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class, so at least I should improve

130
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,960
a lot this semester.

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,180
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

132
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,280
It's the United Nations in my class.

133
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,720
We have people from all over the world.

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,720
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scot, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean,

135
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,680
a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

136
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Who else do we have?

137
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,960
Oh, we have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

138
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,600
That's quite the array of nationalities.

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,560
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:23,040
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani,

141
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
and one Russian.

142
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,560
Well, I think you're pretty lucky, actually.

143
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,360
You have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

144
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,800
I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with

145
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,040
the language barrier.

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,280
I think I might change classes.

147
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Don't!

148
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Stay the course.

149
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,600
Your Chinese will be eternally grateful.

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,920
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

151
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,840
I highly doubt it.

152
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

153
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,240
Well, there is that, yes.

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,640
All right, we're back.

155
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,040
So now we have more nationalities prepared for you.

156
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,360
So let's take a look at those now on Language Takeaway Part 2.

157
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,600
Language Takeaway We're in Asia for this part of today's lesson,

158
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,520
so we're going to start with a country called Pakistan.

159
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
What do we call the people from Pakistan?

160
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,480
We say they are Pakistani.

161
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,160
Okay, so in Chicago, for example, there are many Pakistanis.

162
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Okay, and moving on to Southeast Asia, we have Indonesians.

163
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,440
All right, Indonesia is the country, and people who come from there are Indonesian.

164
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Okay, very good.

165
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,880
Now if we go back to the north part of Asia, we have South Koreans.

166
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,600
So we have North and South Korea on our maps.

167
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,680
A person from North Korea is North Korean, and a person from South Korea is South Korean.

168
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,320
It's kind of like that same structure, American, Brazilian, Korean.

169
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Very good.

170
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
And moving to the island of Japan, we have Japanese.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So this is an adjective.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,800
We're talking about a Japanese person.

173
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,840
He is Japanese.

174
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,400
Or we can also talk about the food, like sushi is Japanese food.

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
That's right.

176
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,680
Okay, moving back to Southeast Asia again, we have Malaysia.

177
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,960
So people from Malaysia are called Malaysian.

178
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Okay, again with this pattern, Malaysian, Korean.

179
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
That's right.

180
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,480
And I think you say Malaysian food or you say Malay?

181
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,800
I've heard some people say Malay.

182
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,640
I've said Malaysian food generally, but Malay I think is one of the languages, and I think

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,800
it's an ethnic group as well, so you can have Malay people in Singapore, for example.

184
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Okay.

185
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,880
And actually we have Thai people and Singaporeans.

186
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,120
So we have two countries there, Thailand and Singapore.

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,720
So Thai is the adjective to describe things that come from Thailand.

188
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
It's kind of unusual.

189
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,420
It doesn't fit that pattern that I mentioned, but it's a very important one to remember

190
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,440
if you like to eat food from this country, Thai food.

191
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah, excellent food.

192
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,360
And Singaporean food is also pretty good, and people from Singapore are also called

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Singaporean.

194
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
Here we've got a very tricky one.

195
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
We've got the country, the Philippines.

196
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,400
What do you call a person from the Philippines?

197
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,600
So the Philippines is actually spelled P-H-I, like Philippines, right?

198
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
But if somebody is from the Philippines, we say Filipino with an F.

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
All right, Filipino.

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,280
This is interesting, especially for people who are native Spanish speakers because the

201
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,400
Philippines was a Spanish colony for a very long time, and so you might hear someone refer

202
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,720
to himself as a Filipino.

203
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,280
He's a man.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,240
Or if she is a woman, a Filipina.

205
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,880
So this is very similar to the Spanish structure of having a gender on the end of the word.

206
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,180
That's right.

207
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,400
And well, now we're moving on to Kazakhstan and Russia.

208
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,360
We have people that are from Kazakhstan and Russia, and we say they are Kazakhstani.

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,400
So this is very common in that part of the world to end the adjective in an I, like Afghanistan,

210
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,280
Afghani, Pakistan, Pakistani, Kazakhstan, Kazakhstani.

211
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,400
And so these are the stans, the former USSR.

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,360
So this is a very important structure to remember, but Russia is pretty easy.

213
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Yeah, people from Russia, you say they are Russian or you have Russian food.

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
I love Russian food.

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,640
All right, so we have a lot of different nationalities there.

216
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,520
And obviously we didn't cover all of them.

217
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,280
I think, I don't know, maybe 200 nationalities.

218
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,160
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more

219
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,400
about this really interesting topic.

220
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,440
Hey, how was your first day of class?

221
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,220
I'm a level two and I'm loving my class this semester.

222
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,000
It's great being in a class of international students.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,280
Mine was okay, except that no one in my class speaks English.

224
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,560
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class.

225
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,600
So at least I should improve a lot this semester.

226
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,840
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

227
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,920
It's the United Nations in my class.

228
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,360
We have people from all over the world.

229
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,400
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scot, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean,

230
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,320
a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Who else do we have?

232
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,640
Oh, we have a Moroccan, a Tagolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

233
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,320
That's quite the array of nationalities.

234
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,240
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

235
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:37,760
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani,

236
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
and one Russian.

237
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,280
Well, I think you're pretty lucky, actually.

238
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,040
You have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

239
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,560
I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with

240
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,720
the language barrier.

241
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,960
I think I might change classes.

242
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Don't!

243
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Stay the course.

244
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,240
Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful.

245
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,560
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

246
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
I highly doubt it.

247
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

248
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,040
Well, there is that, yes.

249
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,840
All right, we're back.

250
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,360
So talking about nationalities, I think there's one that we didn't mention that's very, very

251
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
popular.

252
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
People from Ireland.

253
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,600
Okay, so people from Ireland are called Irish.

254
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,680
Irish.

255
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
The Irish or Irishmen.

256
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,520
This is a similar structure to a lot of those countries in Northern Europe like Sweden and

257
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Finland.

258
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
That's right.

259
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,360
So somebody from Sweden would be called Swedish.

260
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,080
Yes, or a Swede is the noun.

261
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,960
So I love to eat Swedish food like salmon.

262
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,400
But a similar structure applies to Finland.

263
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,360
In Finland, they're very famous for their Finnish bread.

264
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Finnish.

265
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,240
So that's the way that you say Finnish with double N, right?

266
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
That's right.

267
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,920
It's not like I finished my homework.

268
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,400
It's like F-I-N-N-I-S-H.

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Finnish.

270
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Finnish.

271
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,480
And now, what about people from Denmark?

272
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
They are Danish.

273
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Danish.

274
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,880
And what about people from Norway?

275
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
They are Norwegian.

276
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,320
So that's one that does not fit the pattern.

277
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,240
And this is a very interesting one that also doesn't fit the pattern at all.

278
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
People from Holland.

279
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
Okay, so Holland as a country has two names.

280
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,320
We sometimes say Holland.

281
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,400
We sometimes say the Netherlands.

282
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,000
But a person who comes from Holland is called Dutch.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,080
He is Dutch.

284
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
That's right.

285
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,040
So it doesn't have to do with neither Holland, you don't say a Hollander, or Netherlands,

286
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,160
you don't say Netherlander.

287
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
It's Dutch.

288
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Dutch.

289
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
And you'll also read this on like cookie tins.

290
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,560
You know, boxes for cookies, Dutch style cookies.

291
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
That's right.

292
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,920
All right, so that's a very important one when it comes to food.

293
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,480
But we're very curious to hear about where you come from.

294
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,520
You should try some of the new vocabulary words that we have introduced here.

295
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,400
Talk about your friends or your family.

296
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,040
But also, tell us if we didn't include your nationality.

297
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
That's right.

298
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

299
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
EnglishPod.com.

300
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:07,240
Enjoy your meal!
