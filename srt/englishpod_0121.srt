00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,480
Welcome back to another advanced lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
And my name is Erica.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,080
So, today we're bringing you another advanced lesson and this time it's kind of historical.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,800
Like the name suggests, we are listening in as a president says goodbye to the nation

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,640
before he steps down from his role as president.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,280
Now actually this dialogue is very much based on President Eisenhower's farewell speech.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Ah, okay.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,760
So a pretty famous...

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,880
Now we have to tell you that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,280
Just a little bit to make it a little bit more understandable.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,440
But it's basically what he said to the nation back in 1969.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,240
Alright now, I will as well tell you that this is a pretty hard dialogue.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,600
It is very hard because the structures are a little bit complicated and even to a certain

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,440
point a little bit poetic, right?

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,400
So why are we taking this speech as our dialogue?

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
What are we going to learn from this?

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, we're going to learn some structures and some words that you can use maybe on a

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,400
resignation letter or maybe in a celebration you want to thank Pete for coming.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,240
Okay, so we're going to learn some pretty difficult vocabulary but also learn some really

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,600
useful structures like you said you could use in a resignation letter or even in a formal

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,920
speech of your own.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Exactly.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,760
Now, this presidential farewell speech is divided into two parts.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,080
So today we're going to do part one and then next time we'll finish the speech with part

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
two.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,240
So let's listen to President Eisenhower as he says goodbye to the nation and we'll come

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:46,080
back just in a little bit.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,640
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Three days from now, after a century of service to our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,400
of office as in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the presidency is vested

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
in my successor.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,240
This evening I come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell and to share

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,360
a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,960
Like every other citizen, I wish the new president and all who will labor with him, Godspeed.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,720
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,320
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,720
of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,000
great nation.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,040
My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a member

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,960
of the Senate appointed me to West Point.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,440
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during the war

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
and the immediate post-war period.

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,280
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we've had during

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,520
these past eight years.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,080
Wow, so Eisenhower is a pretty good speaker, isn't he?

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,240
A good speaker and well, he said a lot of really nice things when he was saying goodbye.

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,560
Yeah, pretty inspiring, I thought.

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Really inspiring and as we said, there were a couple of different and difficult words

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,480
and phrases, so why don't we start right now with Language Takeaway.

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Language Takeaway.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:30,260
Well, Eisenhower said that in three days he shall lay down the responsibilities.

54
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,320
To lay down the responsibilities.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,040
All right, lay down something.

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
Basically, we understand the verb to lay down, right?

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,880
To put it down, to put it on the ground.

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,800
Right, now he's using it with responsibilities which is a little bit strange but it's kind

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,240
of like a metaphor by saying lay down arms, to lay down your weapons.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,760
Right, and you know what?

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,160
This is a really common phrase that we would hear especially when we're talking about the

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,600
end of a war or something like that.

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
To lay down your arms, lay down your weapons.

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,160
Yeah, so here I think Eisenhower is kind of referencing this and giving us a little bit

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,040
of poetry in his speech.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,000
Right, so it's not that he's quitting, it's not that he's being fired, he's just like

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,920
finishing what he started.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,720
Yes, so he's laying down his responsibilities.

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,280
Now, I think this would be quite an interesting phrase to use for example in a resignation

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
letter.

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,360
Right, so I would say a month from now I will lay down my responsibilities as manager.

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,720
Yep, all right, so that sounds pretty good.

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Now, he said he's going to be laying down the responsibilities in a traditional and

74
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,720
solemn ceremony.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
All right, solemn.

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Now, solemn, what does that mean?

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
What is a solemn ceremony?

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,800
Well, a solemn ceremony would be a serious, respectful and a little bit sad ceremony.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,640
Okay, so it's a serious matter and it's very respectful, right?

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, so you might say for example on the 11th of November when you're remembering the

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,720
war you might say something like this is a very solemn day.

82
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Very good.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Okay, and the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Okay, so interesting verb.

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,400
So interesting word, vested.

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,680
Vested.

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,880
The authority vested in my successor.

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Very good.

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
So this word basically means power that I have by law.

90
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,360
Right, so this power, this important power you have is given to you by the law, by the

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,600
president, by the country.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,200
This is a very common word you will hear in a wedding when the priest or the person that's

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,280
leading the wedding will say by the power vested in me by the state of California.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,640
So he's saying the power that I have given to me by the state of California I can now

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
make you be married.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,160
So here Eisenhower is saying the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,920
So the power of the presidency will be given to the next president by law.

100
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Exactly.

101
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,200
And he also wished the new president and everyone with him, he said Godspeed.

102
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
All right, Godspeed.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Godspeed.

104
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I wish you Godspeed.

105
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,080
Now, Godspeed, what does that mean?

106
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,120
Well, it's kind of a blessing.

107
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,400
It basically means good luck and good fortune.

108
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,520
All right.

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
And especially in a journey.

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,280
Yeah, I think you'd almost only use this when someone's going off on a big trip or a journey.

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,080
So here they're going on the journey of the presidency.

112
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Right.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
So I wish you Godspeed.

114
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Godspeed.

115
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,160
Very good.

116
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,400
And now let's take a look at our last set of words.

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,520
When he was talking about Congress, he said that his relation with Congress began on a

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,440
remote and tenuous basis.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
All right.

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,280
So two interesting words here, remote and tenuous.

121
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Now, remote, we understand as being far away or distant.

122
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Yeah.

123
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,680
What about tenuous, though?

124
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,360
But tenuous is kind of unimportant or not really relevant.

125
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
All right.

126
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
So actually, this is a pretty high quality, useful and smart sounding word.

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,640
So I think we should hear a few more examples of how it's used.

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,880
Example one.

129
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,560
How can you say the earth is actually getting cooler?

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,440
That is a pretty tenuous argument.

131
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,720
Example two.

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,000
John believes that Elvis Presley is still alive.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,880
He's got a tenuous hold on reality.

134
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,400
Example three.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,760
You're making yourself seem more important than you are.

136
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,680
The connection between our company's success and your performance is tenuous at best.

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
All right.

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,040
So as we said, these are some pretty difficult words that we found in the dialogue.

139
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,000
But now I want to go and look at some really interesting formal structures that Eisenhower

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
used here.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Fluency Builder.

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
All right.

144
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,320
On Fluency Builder today, we have three phrases.

145
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,800
And well, starting with the first one, I think it's one of the most interesting ones.

146
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,160
He said, three days from now, after half a century of service of our country, I shall

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,840
lay down the responsibilities of office.

148
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
All right.

149
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,820
So what's interesting about this?

150
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,800
If you take a look at the structure, he's saying three days from now, which is future,

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,800
and then he makes a reference to the past after a half century of service.

152
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,060
Okay.

153
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,620
So we've got future past.

154
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,120
And then again, future, I shall lay down the responsibilities.

155
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
All right.

156
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,520
So this actually is quite a good structure if you're giving a farewell speech or even

157
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,440
I could imagine using this at a wedding.

158
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Right.

159
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
How would you use it in a wedding?

160
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,720
I might say, 12 hours for now after a long and beautiful relationship, this couple shall

161
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
marry.

162
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Very good.

163
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
So you're making reference to the future and then a past event or something that's been

164
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,880
going on for a while and then future again.

165
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
Why don't we do one more example?

166
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,480
So for example, in a resignation letter, I can say, one month from now, after 30 years

167
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,320
of hard work and dedication to this company, I shall lay down my responsibilities as product

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
manager.

169
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
All right.

170
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Interesting.

171
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,640
So we can use it and it sounds good.

172
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
It sounds very professional.

173
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
And very poetic.

174
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Very poetic.

175
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
It sounds nice.

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Yeah.

177
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
All right.

178
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
So that's a good structure.

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,400
Now, why don't we go on to this next kind of very formal and helpful in a very formal

180
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
speech?

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,920
Well, President Eisenhower said, this evening I come to you with a message of leave taking

182
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,240
and farewell.

183
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,840
So this evening I come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell.

184
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,320
So it's a very nice way of saying, I'm talking to you today because I am saying goodbye.

185
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Yes.

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
And what I really like about this phrase is the beginning part.

187
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
This evening I come to you with a message of.

188
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,840
So again, let's suppose we're at a wedding.

189
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,680
If I'm offering a toast or I'm the best man, I could say, this evening I come to you with

190
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,320
a message of love and trust and respect.

191
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
All right.

192
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Or maybe if you're the leader of a company, you might say something like, this afternoon

193
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,680
I come to you with a message of hope for the future.

194
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Very good.

195
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,840
And now the part when he says leave taking and farewell, it's basically saying taking

196
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,280
leave or taking like a vacation, right?

197
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Yeah.

198
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,320
And farewell is goodbye.

199
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,080
And what about our last phrase?

200
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,820
This is actually a bit of a long one.

201
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,260
So I'm going to read it now.

202
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,880
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions

203
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,580
of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our

204
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
great nation.

205
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
Okay, great.

206
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,960
So let's take a look at the first part.

207
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,720
Basically he's saying the people expect the president and the Congress to give them answers,

208
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
right?

209
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Yeah.

210
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,160
To agree on important issues.

211
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,360
But in the part when he says the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our

212
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
great nation.

213
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Yeah.

214
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,920
And this is the part I want to focus on.

215
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,000
The wise resolution of which.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,680
Now this is a really wonderful sort of formal structure.

217
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,880
So we can see what he's doing here.

218
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,340
He's talking about the first idea, right?

219
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,920
So the president and the Congress need to find agreement on important issues, right?

220
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,880
Now the wise resolution of which.

221
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,760
So he's referring back to that idea.

222
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,600
So the wise resolution of what?

223
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,360
Of the essential agreement on questions of great importance.

224
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Right.

225
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,520
So really useful structure.

226
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,460
Why don't we hear a few more examples of this?

227
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:06,080
Example one, we now face a great challenge, the overcoming of which lead us all to untold

228
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,980
riches and success.

229
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:16,440
Example two, we as a company now face our most difficult months to date, the outcome

230
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,240
of which will determine our company's future.

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,640
Example three, the ambitious plan to reduce poverty, the start of which was launched last

232
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:34,520
Tuesday in New York, will require a huge investment of taxpayers' dollars.

233
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
All right.

234
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,680
So as you can hear from the examples, we have the main idea and then he passes on, but then

235
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
kind of refers back to it again.

236
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Yeah.

237
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,360
And this sounds quite formal, but also quite literary and intelligent.

238
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
It makes you sound well-spoken.

239
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,820
Very good.

240
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,400
This was quite a difficult dialogue with some really interesting and tricky structures and

241
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
words.

242
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,840
Let's hear it one more time all together.

243
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:08,600
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

244
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,440
Three days from now, after a century of service to our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities

245
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,360
of office as in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the presidency is vested

246
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
in my successor.

247
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,200
This evening, I come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell, and to share

248
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,220
a few final thoughts with you.

249
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:33,760
My countrymen, like every other citizen, I wish the new president and all who will labor

250
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
with him Godspeed.

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,680
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

252
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,280
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions

253
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,680
of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our

254
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,960
great nation.

255
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,720
My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a

256
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,120
member of the Senate appointed me to West Point.

257
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,400
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during the war

258
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,680
and the immediate post-war period.

259
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,240
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we've had during

260
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,640
these past eight years.

261
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:25,920
All right, we're back, and here with us in the studio we have Pete, the actor in the

262
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,760
dialogue of President Eisenhower's presidential farewell speech.

263
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,760
He's a pretty convincing actor at that.

264
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Not quite.

265
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,720
So, Pete is going to give us a little bit of insight about President Eisenhower.

266
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,840
All right, so what can you tell us about President Eisenhower?

267
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,700
Well, he started off as a general.

268
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,000
He was an accomplished officer all through the early 20th century, and then he was the

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,160
supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II.

270
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,580
And so now he's most famous for D-Day.

271
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,620
He was leading it?

272
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,620
Or he was on the battlefield?

273
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,560
No, he was the organizer.

274
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,680
He was kind of like the brains behind the operation.

275
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Yeah.

276
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,280
I don't know if you want to leave this in, but there's a really cool document that he

277
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,460
wrote right before the invasion, and it said he basically knew this was going to go one

278
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,160
of two ways, and he wrote down a script to read in case it failed.

279
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,480
And he basically said, you know, I'm sorry to inform you that the invasion did not go

280
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,200
as planned, and this is setback our war effort.

281
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,460
And when the invasion went well, he threw that in the trash, and then one of his aides

282
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,400
found that and was like, wow, this is a historical document.

283
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
And they kept the...

284
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Oh, really?

285
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Yeah.

286
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
So they had the copy.

287
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Alternate history.

288
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,200
All right, so he was an accomplished general, an amazing warrior.

289
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
But what about his presidency?

290
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,800
Well, at the beginning, probably the biggest thing he did was to wrap up the Korean War,

291
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,640
which was a vow he made during his campaign.

292
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,040
And then he visited Korea.

293
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Obviously the war is still technically on, but they did arrange a ceasefire.

294
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,720
Eisenhower built up the interstate highway system, which is one of the big reasons that

295
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,760
America was able to become economically successful in the 20th century.

296
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,980
He did it basically so that in case of a war, we'd have an easy way of shipping our soldiers

297
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,880
and nukes across the country.

298
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,080
But it worked well anyways.

299
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,320
Yeah, it's one of these things that pays a side benefit.

300
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,440
At least he had to sell it to the country that way.

301
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,280
It's very likely that he didn't intend ever to use it that way.

302
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,200
But you have to have...

303
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
It's like the war on terror.

304
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
You got to sell these things.

305
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,840
Well, and I guess it's had a huge impact not only on the economy of the states, but also

306
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,480
like the culture and the way that people view the car and its effect on society.

307
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Definitely.

308
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,360
So pretty influential guy, this Eisenhower.

309
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,880
Yeah, and a very historical lesson.

310
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,800
It's just a little bit of a culture and maybe some insight on American history.

311
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,400
It's not like we're politically active or anything, but yeah, it was some interesting

312
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
information there.

313
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,840
And also, well, he was considered to be a pretty good president.

314
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,560
Yeah, he's rated, I wouldn't say among the top five or so, but quite accomplished.

315
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,480
Well, maybe not the greatest president we've ever seen, but he wrote a pretty good farewell

316
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
speech.

317
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,240
So I think we have that to thank him for.

318
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,760
All right, guys, so if you have any other questions or comments, you can come to the

319
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,760
website at EnglishPod.com and you can leave them there for Erica or I.

320
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Okay, so thanks for downloading you guys and until next time, goodbye.

321
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Bye.
