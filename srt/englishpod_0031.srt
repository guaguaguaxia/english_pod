00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,920
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,980
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,200
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,920
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about appointments.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
That's right.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,120
We've got an elementary lesson about cancelling an appointment.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,460
It's a really common situation sometimes.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,920
You have an appointment at the doctor's or something.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,160
Or at work.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
And you have to cancel it.

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Yes.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,000
So we're going to learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's go straight to the dialogue then.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,320
We're going to be listening as Samantha and Angela have a phone conversation.

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,320
And Angela is trying to cancel an appointment.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,520
And it's going to be a little bit fast in the beginning.

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,640
But when we come back, we will explain all the great vocabulary.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Hello, Samantha speaking.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Hi, Samantha.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,640
This is Angela calling.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh, hi, Angela.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
What's up?

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,640
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,640
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Let me see.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm really sorry.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
It's just this thing came up and...

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Angela, you know what?

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I can't make it to our meeting either.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Sounds great.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
See you tomorrow.

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Angela, look up.

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,640
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Isn't that Samantha?

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
What?

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,640
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Oh, no.

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I think she saw me.

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Okay, we have some really interesting words that you probably listened to in this dialogue.

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
So let's start with language takeaway.

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Today on language takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Erica, what's the first one?

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640
The first word is reschedule.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Reschedule.

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Reschedule.

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Reschedule.

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,640
When you reschedule an appointment, you...

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Change it for another day or time.

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Exactly.

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Great.

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
The second word that we have is inconvenience.

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Inconvenience.

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Inconvenience.

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Inconvenience.

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
So, to inconvenience someone is to...

61
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,640
To make things not convenient for that person.

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Right.

63
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,640
So, to make things a little bit difficult or to make things a little bit...

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Uncomfortable.

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Uncomfortable.

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Inconvenience.

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
And our third word is...

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Postpone.

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Postpone.

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Postpone.

71
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Postpone.

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,640
We have some examples of the word postpone that will help you to understand its meaning

73
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
a little bit better.

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's listen.

75
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Example 1.

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting.

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Example 2.

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm sorry, Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month.

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Example 3.

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed.

81
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Okay, so basically postpone is to delay.

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
That's right.

83
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Make it at a later time.

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
At a later time.

85
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Okay, some great words there and we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower

86
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
speed.

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Hello, Samantha speaking.

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Hi, Samantha.

89
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
This is Angela calling.

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Oh, hi, Angela.

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
What's up?

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

93
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

94
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Let me see.

96
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,640
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm really sorry.

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,640
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
It's just this thing came up and…

100
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Angela, you know what?

101
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I can't make it to our meeting either.

102
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

103
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Sounds great.

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,640
See you tomorrow.

105
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Angela, Angela, look up.

106
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,640
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

107
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Isn't that Samantha?

108
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
What?

109
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,640
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

110
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Oh, no.

111
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
I think she saw me.

112
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Alright, so in this dialogue, we had some really great phrases that we should look at

113
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
in Fluency Builder.

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,640
We have three phrases for you today in Fluency Builder, and the first one is so common.

115
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
It's a great phrase.

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,640
What's up?

117
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
So, this is a very common way of saying hi.

118
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Yeah.

119
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
What's up?

120
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
How's it going?

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
What's going on?

122
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Right, and now the interesting thing is that many people don't know how to answer this phrase.

123
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Yes, I see this all the time with my students.

124
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
So, if you say what's up, you should say…

125
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Not much.

126
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Not much.

127
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Nothing.

128
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Nothing.

129
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
So, what's up?

130
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Not much.

131
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Not much.

132
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Alright, so the next time someone tells you what's up, now you know what to answer.

133
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Yeah.

134
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Okay, our second phrase is can't make it.

135
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Can't make it.

136
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
I can't make it.

137
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,640
We use this phrase when we want to say I cannot attend.

138
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I cannot make it.

139
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Yeah, I can't come.

140
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Right, so if you're having a party today, I say, oh, I'm sorry, I can't make it.

141
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
It means I can't go.

142
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Exactly.

143
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Maybe one more example.

144
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
So, Marco, we've got a meeting today at three o'clock.

145
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
I can't make it.

146
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm recording today.

147
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Oh, okay.

148
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640
So, can't make it.

149
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Our last word for fluency builder, this thing came up.

150
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
This thing came up.

151
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
This thing came up.

152
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,640
This is a great way of giving an excuse for why you can't make it to an event.

153
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Right.

154
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,640
So, I can't make it today because this thing came up.

155
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Like, something…

156
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Something happened.

157
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Something happened.

158
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah.

159
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Let's listen to a few examples of this phrase so we can see how it's used in the wild.

160
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Example one.

161
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I'm sorry that I'm late, this thing came up at work and I had to stay to take care of it.

162
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Example two.

163
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
I can't talk right now.

164
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Something came up.

165
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Example three.

166
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Sorry I missed the meeting.

167
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Something came up.

168
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Okay, great example and I guess it's perfectly clear now.

169
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Yes.

170
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,640
So, let's listen to our dialogue a third time and now we're ready to understand everything.

171
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm really sorry.

172
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,640
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

173
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It's just this thing came up and…

174
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Sounds great.

175
00:07:40,640 --> 00:08:06,640
So, Erica, have you ever cancelled an appointment like this under false pretenses?

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,640
So, for a fake reason?

177
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
For a fake reason to go shopping?

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I may not have told my boss so I can't make it to a meeting because this thing came up

179
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
and then I really was going shopping.

180
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
I've never done that.

181
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
But how about you, Marco?

182
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Well, you know, in Ecuador, soccer is a really big thing.

183
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Right.

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,640
So, when we were playing in the World Cup, Ecuador was playing and…

185
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Not you, but…

186
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Well, no, like the Ecuadorian soccer team.

187
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I cancelled an appointment because I was going to go watch the game.

188
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Really?

189
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
A business appointment.

190
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
A business appointment.

191
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Well, I guess that's okay.

192
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah, I mean, it was like the first time we were ever in the World Cup and, you know,

193
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,640
my boss didn't really put up much of a fight because I guess he also wanted to go watch the game.

194
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
So, very similar to the events in this dialogue.

195
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Very similar.

196
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I guess that's kind of the inspiration behind it.

197
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
All right, guys.

198
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I hope you found some of these phrases helpful and useful.

199
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
