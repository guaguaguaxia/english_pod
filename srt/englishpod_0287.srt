00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,720
My name is Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson in which we're going

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,600
to talk about small talk.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
That's right.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,160
Today we're going to talk to an old friend and so we're going to give you some of the

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,640
words and phrases you need to talk about your past or talk about how you have been.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,480
So let's listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to discuss it.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,520
I hate coming to high school reunions.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,840
It'll be great, honey.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,520
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,600
Yeah, I guess so.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,080
Oh look, there's Robert Matthews.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Rob.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Hey, Bill.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Wow.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Great to see you.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Likewise.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
It's been a long time.

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
This is my wife, Dorothy.

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,180
Pleasure to meet you.

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,000
So Bill, how have you been?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,160
Can't complain.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,960
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
How about you?

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
Ah, you know me.

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,640
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
You remember her.

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,480
We were high school sweethearts.

31
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,560
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
That's good.

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Have you seen Frank?

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,960
I was hoping he would come tonight.

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,840
You didn't hear?

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,960
Frank passed away last year.

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Are you serious?

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

39
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
He'll be here soon.

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
I saw him last week.

41
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,520
I was hoping he would show up.

42
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Alright we're back.

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,520
So now let's get started with our language takeaway.

44
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,240
Language takeaway.

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,800
The first phrase we have here in language takeaway is a very important one because it

46
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,360
is the setting for today's dialogue.

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,960
We are at a high school reunion.

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
That's right.

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,400
So everyone knows what high school is, but a high school reunion is when you go back

50
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,280
to your high school for a party maybe five years or ten years after you graduate.

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,800
So then you meet all your old friends from high school.

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,440
You talk about how you have been and just meet up with everyone that maybe you haven't

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
seen in a very long time.

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Exactly.

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,200
So a reunion usually happens every five years, ten years, or twenty years.

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,760
It can happen at different times, but this is important because you can have many different

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,640
kinds of reunions like a college reunion or a high school reunion.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,480
I've even heard of some people who had an elementary school reunion.

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Really?

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Wow.

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,360
Imagine seeing your classmates when you were maybe ten years old.

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
I couldn't imagine.

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
Alright so we're at a high school reunion and we are there because we're going to meet

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,960
our old classmates and to catch up and see how they have been.

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,640
Okay so this is exactly what you do at a reunion.

66
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,200
You catch up with people that you maybe lost touch with, to catch up means to find out

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,780
about what people have been doing since the last time you talked.

68
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,920
So maybe Marco and I were classmates in high school and we haven't talked in ten years.

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
I say, Marco, I want to catch up.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,400
I want to learn about what you do, who you married, where you work, things like that.

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,540
Right, so when two people get together to catch up, maybe it doesn't even have to be

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,040
a very long time.

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Maybe you haven't seen your friend for a week and so you want to get together, have a cup

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,520
of coffee and catch up and see how the relationship has been going or how it works so you want

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
to catch up.

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,720
So you can say this in a very simple way, let's catch up or it's been nice to catch

77
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
up.

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
That's right.

79
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,840
Alright, moving on to our next word.

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,560
This guy Bill meets up with Robert Matthews and they're saying, hey, wow, great to see

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,080
you and he answers by saying, likewise.

82
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,800
So it's good to see you, likewise.

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,280
That means it's good to see you too.

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,840
So you don't have to repeat everything that person just said.

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,080
For example, if I just meet someone new and I say it's a pleasure to meet you, you can

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
say?

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
I could say likewise.

88
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,960
Because I don't want to say it's a pleasure to meet you too.

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
That's so many words.

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,240
So likewise is a very short way to say all of those things.

91
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,320
That's right.

92
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,320
So we were finding out about Robert Matthews and he says that, well, he is a dedicated

93
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,860
bachelor.

94
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,360
So a dedicated bachelor, what is a bachelor, Marco?

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,640
So a bachelor is a person who is not married, a person who is single.

96
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
A man.

97
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,680
A woman cannot be a bachelor.

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,800
So a bachelor is specifically a man and he's not married and we often have a stereotype,

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
that means we have an idea of what a bachelor lives like.

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,120
He has only beer in his refrigerator and he has many relationships and no wife.

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
That's right.

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,960
So a dedicated bachelor is a person who is not married and doesn't really seem to want

103
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,600
to get married or any of this.

104
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
He wants to stay single.

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Exactly.

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay.

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,400
And well, to finish off, this guy Robert lied a little bit to Bill saying that Frank had

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,920
passed away.

109
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,480
That's really mean, but this phrase to pass away is very important and something we should

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
talk about.

111
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,040
So what does it mean to pass away?

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,200
It's another way of saying he died.

113
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
So it's nicer.

114
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Yeah, it's a lot more subtle and nicer.

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,280
So instead of saying Frank died, you say Frank passed away.

116
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,040
So you could say, you know, last year my grandmother passed away.

117
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,160
That's a way of saying that my grandmother died last year, but again, it's a lot nicer

118
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
way to say that.

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah, because the word died can be a little bit too direct and too harsh.

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,760
So maybe saying my grandmother passed away last year, it's a nicer way of saying it.

121
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Okay.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,680
So that's all the language takeaway you have.

123
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,080
Let's take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back.

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
I hate coming to high school reunions.

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,480
It'll be great, honey.

126
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,200
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

127
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,240
Yeah, I guess so.

128
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,760
Oh look, there's Robert Matthews.

129
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Rob.

130
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Hey Bill.

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Wow.

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Great to see you.

133
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Likewise.

134
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
It's been a long time.

135
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,280
This is my wife, Dorothy.

136
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
Pleasure to meet you.

137
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
So Bill, how have you been?

138
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,760
Can't complain.

139
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,560
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

140
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
How about you?

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Ah, you know me.

142
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

143
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,280
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

144
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
You remember her.

145
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,160
We were high school sweethearts.

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,240
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

147
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
That's good.

148
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Have you seen Frank?

149
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
I was hoping he would come tonight.

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
You didn't hear?

151
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,640
Frank passed away last year.

152
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Are you serious?

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,360
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
He'll be here soon.

155
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I saw him last week.

156
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,480
He told me he would show up.

157
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,160
Alright let's move on now to four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Fluency Builder.

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,760
So the focus of today's Fluency Builder is small talk.

160
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,200
These are phrases you can use when you're at a reunion or a dinner, especially with

161
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
people you don't know very well.

162
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,920
So let's jump in and look at this first phrase.

163
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,320
Great to see you.

164
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
That's right.

165
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,380
So he says, hey Bill, wow, great to see you.

166
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,120
So this is a nice little opening phrase saying, wow, I'm really excited to see you.

167
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm really happy to see you.

168
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Exactly.

169
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
It means I'm happy.

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Look at you.

171
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Great to see you.

172
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,360
You say this at the beginning of a conversation.

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
That's right.

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,600
And actually Bill responded by saying likewise.

175
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
So we talked about this.

176
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,320
He's saying, wow, great to see you too.

177
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Then he continues by saying, it's been a long time.

178
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,760
This means that these two people, they have not seen each other in a very long time.

179
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,520
You can also say, it's been so long or it's been a long time.

180
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,640
That means it's been a long time since we last saw each other.

181
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
That's right.

182
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,440
So Robert goes on to ask Bill.

183
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,280
He says, well, you know, how have you been?

184
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,920
How are things?

185
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,960
Bill answers by saying, can't complain.

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Okay.

187
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,840
So this is not grammatically correct.

188
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,480
Normally you need a subject.

189
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,240
I can't complain.

190
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,880
But when we're speaking in English and we're having a conversation like this, it's okay

191
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,600
to say just can't complain as a phrase.

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,640
So he's saying, how have you been?

193
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,200
Well, I can't complain.

194
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Can't complain.

195
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
That means nothing bad has happened.

196
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Things are okay.

197
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Right.

198
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,240
You're saying that things are good.

199
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,400
They're not fantastic, but they're not bad either.

200
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,320
So you can't really complain.

201
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,640
So it's just a phrase where very directly you can say, oh, can't complain.

202
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
Everything's great.

203
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,160
So you could even say this about other things.

204
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,760
Like, you know, I asked John how his job was and he said, can't complain.

205
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Right.

206
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,160
It's not great, but it's not bad.

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Right.

208
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Exactly right.

209
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
All right.

210
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,440
And obviously we saw how Robert lied to Bill by saying that their good friend, that their

211
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,320
good friend Frank had passed away.

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
And he said, are you serious?

213
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,000
No, I'm just yanking your chain.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Okay, so this might sound very strange to a lot of you because a chain is something

215
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,000
that doesn't really seem to fit in this conversation.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,760
But yanking your chain, remember this as a phrase, it means I'm just joking.

217
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Right.

218
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I'm not serious.

219
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm just kidding.

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm lying to you, I guess.

221
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Right.

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,520
So, but how can you use this in another context?

223
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay.

224
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,000
I could say, you know what, Marco, I have something I have to tell you.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,840
And I say what?

226
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm leaving EnglishPod.

227
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
I quit.

228
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Are you serious?

230
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
No, I'm just yanking your chain.

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Okay.

232
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,920
Or no, I'm just kidding.

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Right.

234
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,840
So you're kind of teasing someone when you do this, right?

235
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,120
I'm just yanking your chain.

236
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,160
I'm just lying to you.

237
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm teasing you.

238
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm making you believe something that isn't true.

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Exactly.

240
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,000
So this is something you can use after you tell someone that you were just joking.

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I'm just yanking your chain.

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,760
I'm just joking with you.

243
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
That's right.

244
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,680
You can't translate it directly or literally because it's not going to make sense.

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,440
So just remember this as a phrasal verb or a phrase in general.

246
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Exactly.

247
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
All right.

248
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,920
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

249
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
I hate coming to high school reunions.

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,320
It'll be great, honey.

251
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,960
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

252
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,080
Yeah, I guess so.

253
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,440
Oh, look, there's Robert Matthews.

254
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Rob.

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Hey, Bill.

256
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Wow.

257
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Great to see you.

258
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Likewise.

259
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
It's been a long time.

260
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,160
This is my wife, Dorothy.

261
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Pleasure to meet you.

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,400
So Bill, how have you been?

263
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,560
Can't complain.

264
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,360
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

265
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
How about you?

266
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,760
Ah, you know me.

267
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

268
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,080
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

269
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
You remember her.

270
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,920
We were high school sweethearts.

271
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,000
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's good.

273
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Have you seen Frank?

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,400
I was hoping he would come tonight.

275
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,280
You didn't hear?

276
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,400
Frank passed away last year.

277
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Are you serious?

278
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,120
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

279
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
He'll be here soon.

280
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
I saw him last week.

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
He told me he would show up.

282
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,320
All right, so we're back and talking about high school reunions.

283
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,200
These are very popular in the United States, right?

284
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,160
They are very popular and I think people often have them every five, ten, fifteen, twenty

285
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,840
years, but most people don't go to the high school reunion until either ten or twenty

286
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,560
years after their high school graduation.

287
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Why is that?

288
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,960
I think five years is very soon.

289
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,720
Ten years is nice because you haven't seen people, but twenty years is really, I think,

290
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,080
shocking because people can be completely different or they could be the same, but it's

291
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,560
been, you know, you were eighteen when you graduated high school.

292
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,320
Now you're thirty-eight years old.

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,280
You have this whole life that you've had and so I think it's much more interesting.

294
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah, it's very interesting and I guess people go to these things half because they do want

295
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,080
to maybe meet up with old friends that they haven't kept in touch with.

296
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,520
I think especially this was very popular before the whole internet revolution.

297
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,180
Now everyone's in touch on Facebook and emails and it's just so much easier to keep in touch,

298
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,000
but before you have to remember that it was basically by telephone or by mail, so actually

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,760
seeing a person ten years or catching up with them was very difficult back then.

300
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,040
Yeah, we all see photos and videos now of our classmates, so it's not quite as surprising

301
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,960
when we bump into them later, but I think it is still interesting though because at

302
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,800
least on my social networking websites there are a lot of people that I don't have connections

303
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,440
to, and so I look forward to my high school reunion when I get to see some of these people

304
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,120
and kind of find out what they've been doing for the past ten or fifteen years.

305
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,720
It's actually very interesting I guess when you see how your classmates have changed,

306
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,040
how maybe the one that used to be the nerd or maybe not very attractive all of a sudden

307
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,920
is really attractive and has like a supermodel as a wife or how these things work out.

308
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,800
Or the high school football captain is now kind of sad and fat.

309
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,440
So yeah, these are the types of surprises that people look forward to when they go to

310
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,100
high school reunions.

311
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,060
So a very interesting subject.

312
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,920
Let us know on our website EnglishPod.com if your high school and the place where you

313
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,800
live, do they have high school reunions or maybe even elementary school reunions.

314
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Yeah let us know.

315
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,440
We hope to find out more about you guys' experiences and until next time.

316
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Bye.

317
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,260
Bye guys.
