00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm Erika.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,200
And today we have a great intermediate lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,680
That's right. We've got some excellent real English for you all about cleaning the house.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,400
Cleaning the house. That's a real life situation, so we're going to give you real English.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,320
Exactly. So in today's lesson, we're going to look at language about cleaning the house.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,720
We're also going to learn a few phrases that you can use if you want to ask someone for

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,360
help and maybe if you're a little bit lazy like me, a phrase or two to avoid doing work.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,960
Okay, well let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,000
All right, great. We have two great words for you today. Erika, why don't you tell us

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the first one?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,260
The first word is such a mess.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,480
Such a mess.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,800
Such a mess.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,240
So when something is a mess.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
It's dirty.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,800
Yeah, or things are everywhere.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Disorganized.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,840
Yeah, so you have your clothes on the floor and your shoes on...

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,320
Okay, so that sounds a lot like my desk at work.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
Your shoes on your desk. Yeah, I've seen that. I've been wanting to ask you about that.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,240
Okay, such a mess. Really, really dirty.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,880
Okay, now let's take a look at our second word, chores.

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Chores.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Chores.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Chores.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,980
Chores is a really common word for...

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,120
Things you have to do around the house.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,480
Like for example, laundry.

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Or making the bed.

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,440
Or when you have to take out the garbage.

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,160
Those are all examples of chores.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,120
Chores, yeah. I guess everyone can remember when they were kids, they had chores to do.

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Yeah, when I was a kid, it was my chore to chop wood.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Chop wood?

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
Yeah.

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
That's a great chore. Playing with an axe.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,480
Maybe if you're a boy, but for a girl, it was not so great.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,560
That's why you're so strong and fit.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,040
Alright, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. It's going to be kind of fast.

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,200
But don't worry if you miss something, because we'll explain all of the important language

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
afterwards.

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Honey, the house is such a mess. I need you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,440
husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

46
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll be there in a second.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,600
This can't wait. I need your help now.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,240
Alright, alright. I'm coming.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Okay, here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,280
for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors. Oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted.

51
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,420
You know what? I have to pick something up in the mall. So why don't you clean the floors

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,960
and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,080
Sure, that's fine. Here's the list of all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything.

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,160
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

55
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Hey honey, I'm back.

56
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,080
Wow, the house looks really good.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,600
Great. Can you set the table?

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,760
Just a sec. I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Wait, don't turn it on.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Oh my god, Marco, what happened there?

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
An explosion.

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,840
We love a good explosion here at English Flash.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,040
We're going to give you as many explosions as possible.

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Okay.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,920
So let's take a look at our language takeaway.

66
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,600
Language takeaway.

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,360
So language takeaway is the part of our lesson where we teach you what we think are some

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,800
really important words that are found in the dialogue.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Exactly. And we have three really important words in our dialogue today. So let's start

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
with the first one.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,720
Tidy up.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
Tidy up.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,100
Tidy up.

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,720
So to tidy up means to...

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,240
Put things in their correct spot.

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,320
Right. So put the shoes on the floor.

77
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,040
Get those shoes off my desk.

78
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,400
Exactly. So tidy up, organize things a little bit.

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah. Put things away.

80
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,440
Okay. Let's take a look at our second word now. Spotless.

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Spotless.

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Spotless.

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
Spotless.

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,320
So when you want something to be spotless...

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,720
You want it to be really clean.

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,440
Really clean, not a spot of dirt on it.

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Like your desk.

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,920
Exactly. My desk is spotless.

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
My desk is not spotless.

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,560
All right. Great word. Now let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway. Mall.

91
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Mall.

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Mall.

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
M-A-L-L, mall.

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
Mall. Yeah. It's a strange sounding word.

95
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,000
It is a little bit funny sounding, but it basically means a large building with many

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,160
shops inside, many different stores inside.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,120
Right. Now in British English, you would say shopping center.

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah. I think that's a little bit more common, but in American English, we say mall.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:19,040
Mall. Great. So now it's time in our show to look at putting it together.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Putting it together.

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay. So in putting it together, we take a word from the dialogue and we show you how

102
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,760
to use this word in real English. So we give you a couple of examples of how this particular

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,880
word can be used.

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,720
Exactly. So the word that we have for today is groceries.

105
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Groceries.

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Groceries.

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Groceries.

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,280
Erica, why don't you tell us what groceries are all about?

109
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,880
So groceries are all of the food items that you need to buy at the supermarket. So like

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,720
your bread and milk and meat and...

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Vegetables.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
Exactly. Those are all groceries.

113
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,480
Okay. So let's listen to some examples on how we use this phrase.

114
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,360
Example one.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,160
There's no milk. Can you go to the grocery store?

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,520
Example two.

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,280
Here's the grocery list. I need all of these things so that I can cook dinner tonight.

118
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't forget anything.

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Example three.

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,040
I hate grocery shopping. I can never find what I'm looking for.

121
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay. Great examples. We heard some really interesting combinations, right?

122
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,840
Yeah. We heard grocery store.

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,720
Which is where you buy your groceries.

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,800
Exactly. Grocery shopping.

125
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,040
Buying all your groceries.

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,480
And grocery list.

127
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
Where you have all the items that you need to buy.

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,880
A list of everything you need to buy.

129
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Exactly.

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,440
You know, grocery store. I think this is quite a common word in Canada.

131
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Probably North America.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,320
Yeah. Do you say grocery store in America?

133
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,720
Well, if it's a small one.

134
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Really?

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Like a small store.

136
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,000
In Canada, I say grocery store for even like a supermarket.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really?

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,640
I would say supermarket for a large one and grocery store for a little corner shop.

140
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,600
All of these little differences in American Canadian English.

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,880
Okay. I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue another time. This time it'll

142
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,200
be a little bit slower.

143
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Honey, the house is such a mess. I need you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her

144
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,560
husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

145
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,040
I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll be there in a second.

146
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,440
This can't wait. I need your help now.

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,800
All right. All right. I'm coming.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,320
Okay. Here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries

149
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:16,040
for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors. Oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted.

150
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,920
You know what? I have to pick something up at the mall. So why don't you clean the floors

151
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,400
and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

152
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,960
Sure. That's fine. Here's the list of all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything.

153
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,600
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

154
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,920
Hey, honey, I'm back. Wow. The house looks really good.

155
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,080
Great. Can you set the table?

156
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,040
Just a sec. I'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast.

157
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:03,880
Wait, don't turn it on.

158
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay. Great stuff. Love hearing that explosion. That vacuum just is a bomb.

159
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,640
Yeah. In this dialogue, there was some really interesting language that you can use if you

160
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,400
don't want to do any chores in the house.

161
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,720
Exactly. So it's time now for Fluency Builder.

162
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Fluency Builder.

163
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,640
You know, Fluency Builder is a part of our show that we use to take a common phrase or

164
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,360
a word that you already know and show you how to express that idea more fluently and

165
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
more naturally.

166
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,280
Exactly. So let's take a look at our first idea that we want to explain.

167
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Let's say you're watching TV like the woman in this dialogue and your husband wants you

168
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,360
to help him do the chores and you say, no, I'm busy.

169
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,640
Right. Or I'm doing something.

170
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,720
Those are two great expressions, but we heard something a little bit different in the dialogue.

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm in the middle of something right now.

172
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm in the middle of something right now.

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,560
Yeah, that phrase is great. It means she's busy. She's doing something.

174
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,280
Yeah. I'm in the middle of something.

175
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Yeah.

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,720
And so, Marco, you can tell us about our next phrase.

177
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Okay. Well, now suppose that you want to say, you'll be there soon.

178
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,760
You might say, I'll be there soon or...

179
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm coming.

180
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Exactly.

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,960
But in our dialogue, we heard something a little bit different. Let's listen.

182
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,240
I'll be there in a second.

183
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
I'll be there in a second.

184
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
So this is a more natural way of saying, I'll be there very soon.

185
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah. You know what? I think I use this phrase almost every day. I'll be there in a second.

186
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's really common.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah. It means I'll be there really fast.

188
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Yes.

189
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:56,720
Okay. So our final item today in Fluency Builder is a great phrase that helps you say the idea

190
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,320
of, could you or would you?

191
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,880
Right. Or can you?

192
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,680
Yeah. So, can you sweep the floor? Could you sweep the floor?

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,400
But in the dialogue, we heard something that's a little bit different.

194
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,960
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket?

195
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,000
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket?

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Great. So this is more natural and it's giving a suggestion.

197
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,600
Yeah. It's sort of a polite way of asking someone to clean the floors.

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,760
Right. It's a really good and polite way of saying it. Yeah. I would agree on that.

199
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,760
This was Fluency Builder. Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue again at its normal

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
speed.

201
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,160
And this time you'll understand a lot better.

202
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:56,920
Honey, the house is such a mess. I need you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,120
husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

204
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll be there in a second.

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
This can't wait. I need your help now.

206
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,120
All right. All right. I'm coming.

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,720
OK. Here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries

208
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,920
for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors. Oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted.

209
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,060
You know what? I have to pick something up in the mall. So why don't you clean the floors

210
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,600
and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

211
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,720
Sure. That's fine. Here's the list of all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything.

212
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:45,480
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home? Hey, honey, I'm back. Wow. The house

213
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,840
looks really good. Great. Can you set the table? Just a sec. I'm just going to vacuum

214
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:12,360
this rug real fast. Wait, don't turn it on. Has this ever happened to you? Has your vacuum

215
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,240
cleaner exploded in your house? Well, not a big explosion like this one. Not so dramatically.

216
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,720
Not so dramatically. But I've had this happen to me before. Yeah. And dust everywhere. And

217
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,400
it's just it's a mess. You don't want to have. You know, this word vacuum is really a very

218
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,800
American word. Yeah. Vacuum. Vacuum the rug. Vacuum the carpet. Yeah. Vacuum cleaner. In

219
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,760
the UK, what do they say? Hoover. Hoover. Hoover. Hoover the rug. Hoover the rug. Which

220
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,440
is interesting because it's actually a brand. Yeah. So I guess it's kind of like American

221
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,200
English. You say, pass me a Kleenex. Oh, that's true. That would be like a tissue. Yeah. So

222
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,800
I guess they say Hoover the rug or Hoover the house. Yeah. Wow. You know, I really love

223
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,280
these small differences in meaning that we have between American English and British

224
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,720
English. Yeah, it's fun. Okay. Well, another interesting thing about this is that the man

225
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,340
was doing the housework. I know. He's a house husband. Yeah. So he's the one doing all the

226
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,760
chores in the house. Yeah, that's well, that's the new trend now. Now it's more popular for

227
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,420
men to stay home and take care of the babies and clean the house. Yeah. Like when I was

228
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:30,080
growing up, my dad would take out the garbage and that was it. My mom had to do everything

229
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,520
else. But now I think it's becoming a lot more common in especially in North America

230
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,720
for the household chores to be divided between the man and the wife equally. Yeah, I think

231
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,560
it's fair. Me too. Yeah. You'd make a good husband, Marco. That's what they say, but

232
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,880
they haven't married me yet. Okay. All right. Well, we're out of time, folks. Be sure to

233

log on to our community website and you can leave all your comments and maybe other house
