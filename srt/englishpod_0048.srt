00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,080
I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,440
And today we're at a party.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah, this is a great, exciting, fun, energetic lesson.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,440
We're at the biggest party in the world, Carnival in Rio.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,120
Okay, so Rio, this is the name of a city, right?

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,840
Yeah, this is a city in Brazil called Rio de Janeiro.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,640
So Rio de Janeiro.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Yeah, different pronunciations, right?

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,280
Yeah, yours sounds a lot more, I don't know, authentic than mine.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,680
So we sometimes refer to it as Rio just to make it shorter.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Yeah, I think that's actually the most common way it's referred to in English.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Yeah, Rio.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,880
It's just like if you would say Los Angeles, you would say LA.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,120
Yeah, or if you're talking about Kuala Lumpur, you might say KL.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
Yeah.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Same idea.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,040
Okay, so we have some words that we're going to preview before we listen to our dialogue.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,720
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Vocabulary Preview.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,880
Okay, in vocabulary preview, we have one word, Sambadrome.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Sambadrome.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Sambadrome.

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Sambadrome.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,840
This is actually a building.

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
So it's a proper noun, not a common noun, right?

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,760
No, it's not really a common noun.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,520
It's a proper noun, but it is a building.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,120
And what happens in this building?

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,360
Basically, it's very similar to a stadium, but each end isn't closed off.

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,680
So you have stands on one side and stands on the other.

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,240
And you have like a little street in the middle.

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,960
So you can sit down and you can watch people parade or walk by, and you can see the dancers

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,120
and everything.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,080
And so what is it used for?

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,840
The Sambadrome is used so that the Samba schools can present their dances and their dancers

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,280
and their costumes to judges and all the people that want to watch them dance Samba.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,320
Okay, so you've been using this word a lot.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Samba.

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Samba.

42
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
What is this?

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,920
It's a dance that Brazil is famous for.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,600
It's a very fast dance, a lot of hip movements, a lot of...

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,080
It's very fast, but it's very, very nice.

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,920
And the music is based with many different type of tropical instruments.

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,560
So it's really, really fun.

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,840
Can you Samba?

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,000
I can Samba a little bit.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,160
It's kind of hard.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,320
It's trickier than what it seems.

52
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,560
Okay, well, we're actually going to hear some Samba music in the dialogue, right?

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Exactly.

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,440
And we're going to hear some Samba that is actually used during Carnival.

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,040
Okay, so let's go to Rio now and listen to some Samba.

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,120
I can't believe we're here.

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Carnival in Rio.

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Seriously.

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,720
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Can you believe it?

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,400
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
I know.

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,440
We're so lucky we found tickets for the Sambadrome.

64
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,680
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Look, it's starting.

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
Wow, this is amazing.

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,760
Look at how many dancers there are.

68
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh my gosh.

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
The costumes are so colorful.

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
This is so cool.

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,280
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Samba schools in Rio.

73
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
No kidding.

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Look at them.

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
They're amazing.

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
Look at that girl on top of that float.

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,240
She must be the Carnival Queen.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Go over there so I can get a picture of you.

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Okay.

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Hurry up.

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Take the picture.

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Come dance with us.

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Oh, really?

84
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
No, I can't.

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Really, I don't know how to dance.

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Honey, I'll see you later.

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:37,080
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

88
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:45,080
All right.

89
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
What a lucky guy.

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
He got asked out to dance by a beautiful Brazilian Samba dancer.

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I know.

92
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,080
I don't think his wife was very happy though.

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Well, we've got some language about Carnival in Rio, right?

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Exactly.

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,880
So let's look at that now with Language Takeaway.

96
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Language Takeaway.

97
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,640
All right.

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,280
Our first word on Language Takeaway today, ticket scalper.

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Ticket scalper.

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,840
Ticket scalper.

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,480
Ticket scalper.

102
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,400
This is actually a job title, I think.

103
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,760
Maybe not a totally legal job title.

104
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Exactly.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,320
So what does a ticket scalper do?

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,720
Basically this person will sell tickets at a higher price to people who don't have tickets.

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Okay.

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,680
So he buys like 100 tickets and goes and stands outside of the Samba Dome or the...

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Stadium.

110
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,480
And he sells them for like twice the price, right?

111
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Yeah, exactly.

112
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Yeah, that's a ticket scalper.

113
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,120
So basically they come in handy sometimes because you want to go to a concert or something

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,840
and you don't have tickets, you got to turn to them, right?

115
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Right.

116
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Okay.

117
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Our next word, prestigious.

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Prestigious.

119
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Prestigious.

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Prestigious.

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Now, this is a very nice word, prestigious.

122
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,080
Before we explain anything, let's listen to some examples.

123
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,320
Example 1.

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Harvard University is one of the most prestigious schools in North America.

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,360
Example 2.

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:24,840
The Academy Award is the most prestigious prize an actor can get in the film industry.

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Example 3.

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,200
He worked really hard and now he is a very prestigious heart surgeon.

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,120
I can see that when something is prestigious, it's really well-respected, right?

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
It's well-known, well-respected.

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
And if you are part of this thing, you can feel a sense of pride.

132
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Right.

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Prestige.

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Okay, now let's take a look at our last word, float.

135
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Float.

136
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Float.

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Float.

138
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
Now, this doesn't mean like to float in water, right?

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,320
No, this is a noun, not a verb.

140
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
It's kind of hard to describe, actually.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,320
Yeah, it is hard to describe.

142
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,400
A float is something that you commonly see in parades.

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Right.

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,480
So, it'd be like a car, but you can't really see the car.

145
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,920
No, because it's covered with decorations.

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,960
With big decorations and it's made to look like an artificial island.

147
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,320
Yeah, or a tree maybe.

148
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,880
So you have people standing on there and dancing or waving.

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Yeah.

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Okay.

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,480
We'll definitely post a picture of a float on our comment section so you could see what

152
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
a float looks like.

153
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Right.

154
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
Now, let's listen to our dialogue again.

155
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,560
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can understand all of these words we've

156
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,560
just talked about.

157
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,760
I can't believe we're here.

158
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,040
Carnival in Rio.

159
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,520
Seriously.

160
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,560
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

161
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,320
Can you believe it?

162
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,760
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

163
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
I know.

164
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,120
We're so lucky that we found tickets for the Samba Drome.

165
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

166
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
Look, it's starting.

167
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Wow.

168
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,800
This is amazing.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Look at how many dancers there are.

170
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Oh my gosh.

171
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,360
The costumes are so colorful.

172
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,980
This is so cool.

173
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,440
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious

174
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,760
Samba schools in Rio.

175
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
No kidding.

176
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,880
Look at them.

177
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,640
They're amazing.

178
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,080
Look at that girl on top of that float.

179
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,920
She must be the Carnival Queen.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,400
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

181
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay.

182
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Hurry up.

183
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Take the picture.

184
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Oh, really?

185
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
No, I can't.

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
No.

187
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Really, I don't know how to dance.

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Honey, I'll see you later.

189
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:11,080
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

190
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
All right, we're back.

191
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
So now, I think we should take a look at some of the phrases.

192
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,040
Yeah, let's go to Fluency Builder.

193
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,080
All right.

194
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,760
Fluency Builder.

195
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,920
So we have this phrase, once in a lifetime.

196
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,280
Once in a lifetime.

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Once in a lifetime.

198
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
Once in a lifetime.

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,400
So this is an expression you would use to say that it doesn't happen very often.

200
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,660
Yeah, it's a really special event.

201
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,440
So like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

202
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,400
Or a once in a lifetime chance.

203
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Okay.

204
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Yeah.

205
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Once in a lifetime.

206
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,280
Let's look at our next phrase, good thing.

207
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,560
Good thing.

208
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Good thing.

209
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,800
Good thing.

210
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,960
So we have some examples for good thing.

211
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,600
Why don't we listen to them and then we'll come back.

212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,320
Example 1.

213
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,360
Good thing I studied for my exam.

214
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,440
It was really hard.

215
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,360
Example 2.

216
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,480
It's a good thing I brought my umbrella.

217
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,680
It rained the whole day.

218
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,880
Example 3.

219
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,120
It's a good thing that I bought my house before the prices went up.

220
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Good thing I had money in my wallet.

221
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
You're happy you had money in your wallet.

222
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
You could also maybe use it as a negative, right?

223
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,480
Like good thing I didn't go.

224
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Right.

225
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,240
I'm happy I didn't go because it was terrible.

226
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Okay.

227
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Good thing.

228
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Yep.

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
All right.

230
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,280
Now let's take a look at our last word, no kidding.

231
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,400
No kidding.

232
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
No kidding.

233
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
No kidding.

234
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Okay, so many of you probably already know this word kidding, right?

235
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Yeah, it means joking.

236
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,960
Yeah, I'm joking.

237
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Just kidding.

238
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Yeah.

239
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Okay.

240
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,640
But if I would say no kidding.

241
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,560
You're saying like, yeah, I totally agree with you.

242
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Right.

243
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
I agree with you.

244
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
I know you are.

245
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I know you're being serious.

246
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I know you're being serious.

247
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I know it's true.

248
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Yeah.

249
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,200
So I could say, wow, this restaurant is really expensive.

250
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
No kidding.

251
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Yeah.

252
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
So you would agree like, yeah, for real.

253
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Yeah.

254
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
All right.

255
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,620
So this term no kidding is slang, right?

256
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
It's a little bit informal.

257
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,620
Yeah.

258
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Yeah.

259
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Okay.

260
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,560
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again for the third time and then we'll come back

261
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,560
and talk about Brazil.

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,840
I can't believe we're here.

263
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Carnival in Rio.

264
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Seriously.

265
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

266
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Can you believe it?

267
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

268
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I know.

269
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
We're so lucky we found time to do this.

270
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

271
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Look, it's starting.

272
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Wow.

273
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
This is amazing.

274
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Look at how many dancers there are.

275
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Oh my gosh.

276
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
The costumes are so colorful.

277
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
This is so cool.

278
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,840
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious

279
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
samba schools in Rio.

280
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
No kidding.

281
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Look at them.

282
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
They're amazing.

283
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Look at that girl on top of that float.

284
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
She's so beautiful.

285
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
She's so beautiful.

286
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Look at that float.

287
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
She must be the carnival queen.

288
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Go over there so I can get a picture of you.

289
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Okay.

290
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Hurry up.

291
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Take the picture.

292
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Come dance with us.

293
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Oh, really?

294
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
No, I can't.

295
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Really, I don't know how to dance.

296
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Honey, I'll see you later.

297
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

298
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Woo!

299
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:50,880
All right, Marco, so carnival, it's a Brazilian celebration, right?

300
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,840
It's very popular in all Latin America.

301
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Oh, really?

302
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,160
Yeah, but Brazilian carnival is very, very special.

303
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,640
Okay, so what are they celebrating?

304
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,320
So basically, it's the beginning of Lent, which is this period of time in the Catholic

305
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,120
religion right before Easter.

306
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Right.

307
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,520
But carnival in Brazil is very special because of all the dancing and all of this and costumes

308
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
and everything.

309
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,080
Yeah, well, from the dialogue, it sounds really wild and crazy.

310
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
So what happens?

311
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,040
Well, it definitely is really amazing and it's just basically a lot of samba music and

312
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,360
partying and it's really nice and especially to be able to see something so spectacular.

313
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,480
It's like hundreds and thousands of dancers in the samba drum and they're parading down

314
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,680
in their costumes and in floats.

315
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,320
So it's a very, very special event.

316
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,560
All right, so it sounds like a lot of fun.

317
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,880
I want to hear from our listeners.

318
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Yeah, for sure.

319
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,920
We have a lot of listeners from Brazil and carnival is not only celebrated in Rio.

320
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,520
It's also in Sao Paulo, in Pernambuco, in Bahia, and it's a little bit different in

321
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
each place.

322
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,480
So it's not just a thing of Rio.

323
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
It's just more popular there.

324
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
Is there a samba drum in each city?

325
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah, there is a samba drum in Sao Paulo.

326
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Oh, cool.

327
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Yeah.

328
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,280
Let us know if you've ever been to carnival or how you celebrate it in your hometown or

329
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280

334
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Okay, everyone.

335
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
Thanks for listening and until next time.

336
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120

337
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Bye.
