00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,560
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,660
And today we're going to go back to the movies, but this time we're going to do it a little

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,660
bit different.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,660
That's right.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,040
We're going to be listening as two movie critics offer their opinion on the latest release.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,320
Alright, so we're going to be learning how to criticize or give your opinions about something.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,480
That's right.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,480
And here we're talking movies, but a lot of this language can be used to offer your criticism

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,320
or ideas on literature or art or other artistic pursuits.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,720
Okay, so before we listen to this dialogue for the first time, let's take a look at vocabulary

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,080
preview.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,680
Well, we're going to look at one word here that we will hear in the dialogue and it is

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
erudite.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Erudite.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Erudite.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,880
Okay, so this word erudite.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Some people pronounce it erudite.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
That's true.

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,680
And basically it's an adjective describing someone who has a lot of knowledge about a

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
subject.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
Okay, so an erudite in engineering.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,440
Yes, or an erudite professor.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,900
Okay, very good.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,360
So that's the word that we're going to preview today.

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:25,520
And now let's listen to our dialogue and find out what movie they are criticizing.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,120
Welcome back movie lovers to another premiere movie review.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,360
My name is Richard Clark and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,620
Thank you, Dick.

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,240
Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,320
Tell me, what is your impression of this film?

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,560
Well, I think this film is simply a fable depicting man's eternal greed for power.

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,180
And in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,920
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries,

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,540
the musical score was amazing.

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,120
The animation was very well done and the story was simply enchanting.

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
I think otherwise.

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,040
Even though the animation was technically strong and as you say, the score and songs

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
performed by Elton John were great.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,040
The film lacks certain originality.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,260
It lacked heart.

44
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,760
And I would dare to say it was too predictable.

45
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Predictable?

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
How?

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,120
Come on, Dave.

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
It's a G-rated movie.

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,000
It's for the kids.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not a thriller.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,740
Well, that's just it.

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,800
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes.

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,720
For example, when Mufasa dies or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,880
Even so, the film is linear.

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,120
Mufasa dies.

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
Simba runs away thinking it's his fault.

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Falls in love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,280
It's just too cliche.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
How can it be cliche?

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
It's a fable.

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,040
It's telling a time-honored story.

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,320
The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power leads to corruption and teaches children

63
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,700
of the value of respect, life, and love.

64
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,320
You have always been so soft, Dick.

65
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,960
Open your heart, Dave.

66
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Don't shut us out.

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,880
Anyway, that's all for today, folks.

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,760
Join us next time as we talk about How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
All right.

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,200
So The Lion King, one of my all-time favorites.

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,080
A very good movie and, well, mixed feelings about it, right?

73
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,360
Some people think it's good.

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,640
Other people think it's not that good.

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm in the good camp, as you know.

76
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,800
But anyway, there's tons of really useful and quite difficult language here.

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,040
So why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
All right.

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,000
On Language Takeaway today, we have five words and we can start with the first one.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,800
So the first critic said that this was a movie depicting man's eternal greed for power.

82
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Depicting.

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
To depict.

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
All right.

85
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,120
So this word, depict, it sounds a little bit strange.

86
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,680
So before we explain it, let's take a look at some examples.

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,200
Example one.

88
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,440
I don't really like the way that novel depicted the role of women in society.

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,440
It was pretty sexist.

90
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,080
Example two.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,300
A film depicts the realities of war very accurately.

92
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,160
Example three.

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,880
Apparently this image here is depicting some of the most well-known scenes from Australian

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
history.

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
All right.

96
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
So depicting.

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,480
I can basically understand that this means to show something.

98
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,320
Now we can notice that the word depict has this short little word picked in there that

99
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,000
sounds like picture.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,680
And when we think about depicting, we're often thinking about in a picture or in a book or

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
in a painting.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
So in this case, the story is depicted in a movie, right?

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
That's right.

104
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
So you can see it.

105
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
It's a picture, basically.

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Exactly.

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
All right.

108
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Very good.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
So to depict.

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,120
Well, moving on, the critic also talked about the grim portrayal of the villain of the movie,

111
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Scar.

112
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
That's right.

113
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
So grim portrayal.

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,160
A grim portrayal.

115
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Okay.

116
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Let's look at the word grim first.

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,560
When something is grim, it's really unpleasant or uncomfortable or even shocking to think

118
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
about.

119
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Okay.

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
So we're going to use something that is grim.

121
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,260
Now what about portrayal?

122
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,760
Really close to depict.

123
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,880
A portrayal is something that shows or describes something, especially like in a book or in

124
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
a picture or in a play.

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay.

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
So a portrayal.

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
I guess we can relate it again to a portrait.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So portrayal.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,480
Now we can also use this as a verb, to portray.

132
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,880
So this movie portrays man's eternal greed.

133
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Okay.

134
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,160
So we can use this as a noun or as a verb.

135
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
That's right.

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,200
So moving on with our third word today, we have an enchanting movie.

137
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
That's right.

138
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
The story was simply enchanting.

139
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Okay.

140
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,960
So if something is enchanting.

141
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,160
It's really attractive and beautiful and interesting and it holds your attention.

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Okay.

143
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
It holds your attention.

144
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
So it's something very nice.

145
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760
Something that is enchanting has to be nice.

146
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
That's right.

147
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
And it has this sense of magic around it.

148
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Okay.

149
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Very good.

150
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,120
So an enchanting moment.

151
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Or an enchanting woman.

152
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Okay.

153
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,680
And now what about our next word?

154
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,080
It's a very...

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,160
And what about our next word?

156
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,240
It's French actually, but we use it in English.

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
That's right.

158
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,960
So the critics said that this story was cliché.

159
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Cliché.

160
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Cliché.

161
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Okay.

162
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,840
So we hear this all the time.

163
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
What is a cliché?

164
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,180
Well, basically, a cliché is a phrase or an idea that is used so often that it loses

165
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,200
its meaning or importance or interest.

166
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Okay.

167
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,640
So can you give us some examples of a cliché moment or maybe a phrase that's cliché?

168
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Okay.

169
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Well, how about this one?

170
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,520
When you're breaking up with your boyfriend and you say, honey, it's not you.

171
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
It's me.

172
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Okay.

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
That's cliché.

174
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
It's typical.

175
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Yeah.

176
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,280
Or maybe a cliché portrayal of a French man would be a guy riding a bike with a baguette,

177
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,440
smoking a cigarette and with a beret on his head.

178
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Okay.

179
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
So it's a cliché portrayal.

180
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Very good.

181
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
So it's common.

182
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,320
It's even to a certain point a little bit stereotypical.

183
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
That's right.

184
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
All right.

185
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
And what about our last word?

186
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Well, they describe this story as a fable.

187
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Fable.

188
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
A fable.

189
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Okay.

190
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,960
So when we were small, we all read fables.

191
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
That's right.

192
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,440
They are stories about animals that are used to teach people a lesson.

193
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Okay.

194
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
So a fable teaches you a lesson.

195
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,960
I think the most famous one is the one of the tortoise and the hare, right?

196
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Yeah.

197
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,520
And another good one would be the three little pigs.

198
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Okay.

199
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
That's also a fable.

200
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Yep.

201
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Okay.

202
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,960
So we've looked at these five great words and now it's time for us to move on to putting

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,200
it together.

204
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Putting it together.

205
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Okay.

206
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,160
Here we're going to look at some phrases that you can use in a bunch of different ways to

207
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,560
help you criticize or give your opinion about a piece of art, like a movie or a book or

208
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
whatever.

209
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Okay.

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's start with our first word.

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
So the film critic asked, what is your impression of this film?

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
What's your impression of?

213
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
What's your impression of something, right?

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
That's right.

215
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
All right.

216
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,720
So before we get into explaining impression, let's listen to some more examples.

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,160
Example one.

218
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,680
I don't know where, but I have the impression that we've met before.

219
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,600
Example two.

220
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,720
I get the impression that he's a very organized person.

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,880
Example three.

222
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,080
Somehow Jim got the impression that I was gay.

223
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,360
Did you tell him that?

224
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Okay.

225
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,280
So I can see that this means basically, what's your opinion or how do you feel about something?

226
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Okay.

227
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,440
So you can have an impression of something or of someone.

228
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Yep.

229
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
All right.

230
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
And what about the next word?

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,280
Well, the critic Richard Clark said that it was a really enjoyable film even despite the

232
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,400
accusations of plagiarism.

233
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Okay.

234
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,520
So now we have an interesting phrase here.

235
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,920
The accusations of plagiarism.

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Accusations of plagiarism.

237
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Okay.

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,080
So accusations is a noun, right?

239
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Right.

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
It's the action of accusing.

241
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Okay.

242
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Of blaming somebody.

243
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah.

244
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
All right.

245
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
And what about plagiarism?

246
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
This is an academic term.

247
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,200
If you plagiarize, you copy someone's work and take credit for it.

248
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Okay.

249
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,520
So if I copy somebody's book and I say I wrote it, then that's plagiarism.

250
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Yeah.

251
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
That's pretty bad.

252
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,920
So accusations of plagiarism.

253
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,720
Now we can use this phrase, accusations of something in a bunch of different ways.

254
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,240
So Marco, let's have an example.

255
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
All right.

256
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,080
So for example, we can say he was cleared of all accusations of tax evasion.

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,280
Okay.

258
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,320
He denied accusations of cheating on his wife.

259
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
All right.

260
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Very good.

261
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
So accusations.

262
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,320
And now moving on to the final part of putting it together, we have this word lacks.

263
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
The film lacks a certain originality.

264
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Okay.

265
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,680
So the film lacks a certain originality.

266
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
What does he mean by that?

267
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
It doesn't have enough of.

268
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Okay.

269
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,720
So if you are lacking something, you don't have enough of it.

270
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
Or you don't have it at all.

271
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
All right.

272
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,360
So can you give us some more examples of how we can use lack?

273
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Okay.

274
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,400
So the same way it's used in the dialogue, our team lacks the appropriate talent to complete

275
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
this project.

276
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Okay.

277
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,320
Or I can say, our school lacks infrastructure for so many students.

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,960
Or we can also say, infrastructure is lacking at our school.

279
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Okay.

280
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,640
So you can use it in those two ways, right?

281
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,120
You can use it as a gerund or as a verb.

282
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
That's right.

283
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Okay.

284
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Lots of great language here.

285
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:04,160
Let's hear it one more time in context with the dialogue.

286
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
Welcome back movie lovers to another premiere movie review.

287
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,040
My name is Richard Clark and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,280
Thank you, Dick.

289
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,880
Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,000
Tell me what is your impression of this film?

291
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Well, I think this film is simply a fable.

292
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,240
Rising man's eternal greed for power.

293
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,840
And in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

294
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,600
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries,

295
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,220
the musical score was amazing.

296
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,760
The animation was very well done and the story was simply enchanting.

297
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,960
I think otherwise, even though the animation was technically strong and as you say, the

298
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,520
score and songs performed by Elton John were great.

299
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,720
The film lacks certain originality.

300
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,920
It lacked heart.

301
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,640
And I would dare to say it was too predictable.

302
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Predictable?

303
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
How?

304
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Come on, Dave.

305
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
It's a G-rated movie.

306
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
It's for the kids.

307
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
It's not a thriller.

308
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Well, that's just it.

309
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes.

310
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
For example, when Mufasa dies or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.

311
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Even so, the film is linear.

312
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault, falls in love and returns to retake

313
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
what's rightfully his.

314
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
It's just too cliche.

315
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
How can it be cliche?

316
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
It's a fable.

317
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
It's telling a time-honored story.

318
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
The movie makes a point of how the hunger for power is a part of the story.

319
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
It's a fable.

320
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
It's a fable.

321
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
It's a fable.

322
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
It's a fable.

323
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
It's a fable.

324
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
It's a fable.

325
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:27,400
It's a fable.

326
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,960
You have always been so soft, Dick.

327
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
Open your heart, Dave.

328
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Don't shut us out.

329
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,560
Anyway, that's all for today, folks.

330
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
Join us next time as we talk about How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

331
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.

332
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,120
All right, so a good movie.

333
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,960
What do you think about The Lion King?

334
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,200
What do you think about his critique?

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Well, I am with Dick on this one.

336
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
I think that this is a great film.

337
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,520
It was one of my favorites and I've seen it about five billion times.

338
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Really?

339
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Yeah.

340
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
You really liked it?

341
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
But I'm not interested in my opinion.

342
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,360
I want to hear criticisms and film criticisms from our users.

343
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Right.

344
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,560
So come to our website at EnglishPod.com where you can leave your questions, your comments,

345
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,760
and also any criticisms on this particular movie or maybe the other one that we mentioned,

346
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

347
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,400
Personally, not so fond of that one, but looking forward to hearing from our users.

348
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
All right.

349
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,920
Or maybe any other movies you might like.

350
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,240
So come to the website and until next time.

351
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Goodbye.

352
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,760
I'll watch Kill Bill at the end.
