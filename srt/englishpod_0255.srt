00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,400
My name is Catherine and today we've got a very advanced dialogue for you.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,400
This is all about what we call the miracle of life.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
That's right.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Today we're going to talk a little bit more in depth about our bodies, about what's going

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,560
on inside and how and where babies come from.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
That's right.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,040
So you're going to learn very technical terms for parts of people's bodies, men and women,

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,040
and also about the beginning of life.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,200
So before a baby is born, what do you call some of these parts and some of these things?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,720
So let's check out today's dialogue and when we come back, we'll be exploring in depth

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,000
these topics.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,920
Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,160
Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I'm sure that some

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,480
of the things we will be talking about today may surprise you.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Billy, can you turn on the projector please?

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Thanks.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Okay.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,040
Does anyone know what this is?

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,440
Looks like a goat head to me.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,800
Nice try.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,760
But this is a woman's womb, which contains her uterus and ovaries.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,760
The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle,

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,500
the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,800
This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of a woman's

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
cycle.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,080
In an average 28-day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,760
days, counting day one as the first day of your last period.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
That's amazing!

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,280
So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,920
Actually every woman is already born with over 400,000 eggs.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,520
Some will start dying off immediately and others are released during her fertile period.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,840
What about the guys?

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
I know they produce sperm and stuff.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
That's right.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,080
The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm 24 hours a day.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,480
Each ejaculation will release about 100 million sperm, so the factory is always pretty busy.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,840
The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,440
So then we basically need to put one and one together so we can have babies, right?

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Yes.

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,880
Some will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,560
Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,000
from the cervix through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,320
This could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 12 hours.

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,200
Not all of them make it since some of them go the wrong way and get lost or simply die.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,120
Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it.

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,280
As this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
is safely inside.

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,880
And then that's it?

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,840
Well the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,400
a new cell that will rapidly start dividing.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,980
The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells known as the embryo travels

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,440
the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
Any other questions?

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,760
Then let's move on.

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
All right we're back.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,240
So very interesting.

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,280
Actually this type of lecture or class that we just saw is very common in biology class

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,240
or anatomy class in the US for example.

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
That's right.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:56,000
We have a class called sex ed or sexual education and this is all about sex and bodies and biology

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,320
that most students have to learn before they go into high school.

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
That's right.

66
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,280
So we actually had a previous lesson about sex ed.

67
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,640
We talked about contraceptives and while continuing on the topic, this is why we have this advanced

68
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
lesson now.

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,560
It is a little bit more difficult because we have medical terms and specific names of

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
parts inside of our body.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,960
So why don't we start with the first one when the teacher explained about a woman's womb.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,400
So this might look like a very hard word to pronounce.

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
There's a B there.

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
So W-O-M-B.

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
We don't pronounce womb.

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,640
We say womb.

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,620
This is basically where the baby will grow when a baby is produced.

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,760
So it's a part inside a woman's body that we also call the uterus.

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,880
So I guess the uterus is the specific name of that area, right?

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,520
But I guess the whole thing, kind of like the woman's belly where the baby is going

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
to be, is called the womb.

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
That's right.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Okay.

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,040
So now taking a look at other parts of a woman's body, we have the womb, we have the uterus.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,180
Now what about the ovaries?

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,560
So ovaries are, actually there are two of them in a woman's body and ovaries are where

87
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,900
eggs are stored.

88
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,840
So women have eggs and this is what will one day become, in some cases, a baby.

89
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,400
And so they are stored in ovaries and when it's time to come down, they come down through

90
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,800
the uterus, through these tubes to either come out or to be met by a sperm.

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Right.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,920
And these tubes are actually called fallopian tubes.

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,040
So a hard word, fallopian.

94
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Again, there are two of these, right, one from each ovary and they come down and that's

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,080
basically a passageway for eggs.

96
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
That's right.

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,680
And it's interesting because in English, some women that don't want to have any more kids,

98
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,040
they very colloquially say, I have my tubes tied or I had my tubes tied.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
That's right.

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,280
So this means a woman has had an operation so that she will not have children in the

101
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,000
future and her fallopian tubes are closed off so that eggs cannot come down.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's right.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,880
And this is kind of now you more or less, if you've heard this phrase before, now you

104
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,280
understand why the fallopian tubes and that's why women say tubes tied.

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,080
Yeah, she had her tubes tied.

106
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
All right.

107
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:26,720
So now all of this is going on because, well, a woman can potentially get pregnant and during

108
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,960
this period of time, this is when the woman is ovulating or this is called ovulation.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
That's right.

110
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,160
So ovulation is a cycle that means it's something that happens again and again and again.

111
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,280
We call it a menstrual cycle and it happens once, basically it's a process that takes

112
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:52,080
28 days and it's the process of an egg coming down and either being fertilized or not.

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
That's right.

114
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,080
So during ovulation, there is a certain period of time where it's precise for a woman to

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,920
be able to get pregnant, right?

116
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,440
And now what about when we move on to the men?

117
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,920
Now we talked about the women's side.

118
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
What about the men's?

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,880
So basically women have eggs, men have sperm.

120
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,280
Okay, these are little, they look like fish almost, they swim around and they are passed

121
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,560
to a woman through semen and men have, I don't know, like 10 million of them or something

122
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
crazy.

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,660
It's a huge amount of sperm.

124
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,800
Now this is an interesting thing to differentiate.

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
You said two things, sperm and semen, right?

126
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
So sperm are the little creatures or little fish as you said that swim and semen is kind

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
of actually like the liquid that contains them.

128
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
That's right.

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,480
So it's almost not bigger than, but it's the liquid that they come in to basically attack

130
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,880
an egg and try and fertilize an egg.

131
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,480
And so remember in English, sperm can fertilize an egg, semen cannot.

132
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
And now this is interesting.

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,320
We're talking about to fertilize.

134
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,040
Maybe we've heard this in gardening or something like this, we've heard a fertilizer.

135
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,040
But what do we mean by to fertilize or fertilization?

136
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:11,840
Okay, basically fertilization or to fertilize something is to, in this case, put a sperm

137
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,040
together with an egg.

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
So to make a baby.

139
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
That's right.

140
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,120
And so an egg that is not fertilized will come down and will never become a baby.

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,400
Because sperm, they don't find eggs and they just, you know, they die.

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,120
Now there's another interesting word that's very related or close to this when we say

143
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,940
when a man or a woman is fertile.

144
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
That's right.

145
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,800
So this only applies to women, not to men.

146
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,240
You can say she's fertile.

147
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,400
That means she has eggs, her eggs come down and she can have a baby at some time.

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,920
But a woman who is infertile, she's not fertile, can never have babies.

149
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
That's right.

150
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
So a lot of these women adopt babies.

151
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
Now what about guys?

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,200
You know that some men can't have babies as well.

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,680
Maybe their sperm is not very good or they have some, same thing, medical condition that

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,600
prevents their sperm from fertilizing.

155
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
So you don't say that he is infertile or not fertile.

156
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
No, you don't.

157
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
What do you say?

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
He is sterile.

159
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Okay.

160
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,960
So a woman can be fertile or infertile.

161
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Infertile means she cannot have babies.

162
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,800
If a man's semen cannot fertilize an egg properly, he is called sterile.

163
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,200
Okay, very good.

164
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,840
So this is all of what's going on inside the man's body as well.

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:33,160
And well, actually once they finally combine and get together and the sperm fertilize the

166
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,080
egg, we have a little thing called an embryo.

167
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,520
Okay, so obviously it doesn't become a baby for a little while.

168
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,780
This is a point of contention, a point of argument for a lot of people because no one

169
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,360
agrees when a baby becomes a baby.

170
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,080
But basically when an egg and a sperm come together, they create an embryo, which is

171
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,280
a combination of genetic information and tissue and all these things.

172
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,160
And that starts to grow and to become a fetus, which will one day when it is born, become

173
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
a baby.

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
That's right.

175
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,040
So the embryo is basically the first stage of when the baby is forming.

176
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,600
But it's not really, as you said, this word fetus, it's not in our dialogue, but a fetus

177
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,920
is actually a formed being, so to say, inside a woman's body, right?

178
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,040
It's growing, it's starting to get the pieces that it needs to become a human being, but

179
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,800
maybe has not fully developed yet.

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,120
So it's still inside the woman's womb, we can say.

181
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Very good.

182
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
Okay, a lot of interesting things going on.

183
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,680
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

184
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life.

185
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,920
Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I'm sure that some

186
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,240
of the things we will be talking about today may surprise you.

187
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
Billy, can you turn on the projector, please?

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Thanks.

189
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Okay.

190
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Does anyone know what this is?

191
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,160
It looks like a goat head to me.

192
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
Nice try.

193
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,520
But this is a woman's womb, which contains her uterus and ovaries.

194
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,520
The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle,

195
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,280
the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes.

196
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,560
This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of a woman's

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,640
cycle.

198
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,160
In an average 28-day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th

199
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,520
days, counting day one as the first day of your last period.

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
That's amazing.

201
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,040
So each month the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?

202
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Actually every woman is already born with over 400,000 eggs.

203
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
Some will start dying off immediately and others are released during her fertile period.

204
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
What about the guys?

205
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,120
I know they produce sperm and stuff.

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
That's right.

207
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,880
The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm 24 hours a day.

208
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,280
Each ejaculation will release about 100 million sperm, so the factory is always pretty busy.

209
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,600
The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

210
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,200
So then we basically need to put one and one together so we can have babies, right?

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes.

212
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,640
The man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.

213
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,300
Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim

214
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,720
from the cervix through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes.

215
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
This could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 12 hours.

216
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,920
Not all of them make it since some of them go the wrong way and get lost or simply die.

217
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,840
Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it.

218
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,960
Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm

219
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,080
is safely inside.

220
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,600
And then that's it?

221
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,520
Well the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release.

222
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,340
The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create

223
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,100
a new cell that will rapidly start dividing.

224
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,680
The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells known as the embryo travels

225
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,160
the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

226
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,360
Any other questions?

227
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,680
Then let's move on.

228
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,280
Alright so this whole aspect, we understand how the miracle of life works, right?

229
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,760
This is what it's called, having babies, the miracle of life.

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,580
It's even the name of a video we were forced to watch when I was 12 years old and I still

231
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,960
have nightmares about.

232
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,440
Well it is interesting, it is almost a miracle because you are basically creating something

233
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
out of nothing almost, right?

234
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,080
That's right and what's amazing about it is that two people who have different genetic

235
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,520
material and who have different experiences and who have different parts to their bodies

236
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,160
come together and create something that's a combination of all those things.

237
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,080
So it's almost kind of like a game of surprise.

238
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,440
You don't know what's going to happen.

239
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,120
Are they going to have red hair or green eyes or are they going to be tall or short or fat

240
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
or thin?

241
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
It's interesting.

242
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,920
Now talking about this aspect that you mentioned before, it's controversial when there is life

243
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,560
or when if the embryo is a baby or it's not.

244
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,360
This is because of many countries or cities or states that are discussing the legalization

245
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,400
or not of abortions.

246
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
That's right.

247
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,240
So the reason this is a problem for a lot of people is because no one agrees on when

248
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,120
a fetus becomes a baby and so that will determine for a lot of people when it is okay to abort

249
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,760
the fetus or to kill it and when it is not.

250
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,360
Because I've heard that some people say, well, in your first month, if you've already been

251
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,200
pregnant for a month, the baby already has certain parts formed or even I think the heart

252
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,960
is beginning to form.

253
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,840
So they say you're already pregnant.

254
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,800
I mean, you already have a life inside you.

255
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Well, they say, well, no, it's actually after two months because then the baby has a heartbeat.

256
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm not really sure about the timetables that I'm giving you.

257
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm giving you more or less a rough outline, but this is the controversy.

258
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
That's right.

259
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
It affects laws in many countries.

260
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,920
It affects what medical practitioners like doctors and nurses can do.

261
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,160
And it's always, I think, been an issue as long as I've been alive.

262
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,360
Actually, the whole abortion topic is a big political debate between people who are against

264
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
it, who are in favor of it.

265
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
So it's very interesting.

266
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,840
And actually, it's still very much illegal in many places in the world.

267
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Absolutely.

268
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,880
And it changes, I think, according to where you are in America as well.

269
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,280
So some states have different laws about it, and some states are more lenient, for example.

270
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,760
And actually, this spawned a whole new controversy with the emergency pill, right?

271
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,040
That basically, if you maybe are in risk of being pregnant, then you take this pill and

272
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,320
it kind of prevents fertilization.

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,960
Or if fertilization occurred already, then it kind of prevents further growth of the

274
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
embryo.

275
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Right.

276
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,520
Basically, it's called the emergency contraceptive, and it's taken after you think you might be

277
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
pregnant.

278
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,840
But if you didn't use other contraceptives, like a condom, and you think maybe one of

279
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,080
your eggs as a woman was fertilized by sperm, it makes you have your period.

280
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,320
It makes you menstruate.

281
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,080
That means the lining of your uterus and any egg, even if it was fertilized, comes out.

282
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,200
And in some cases, people think of it as a kind of abortion.

283
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
That's right.

284
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,160
So yeah, it's very interesting how the more that we understand about medicine and about

285
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,760
how life works, well, there have been advancements as well, like contraceptives that not only

286
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:51,560
prevent unwanted pregnancies, but also prevent transmission of diseases, sexually transmitted

287
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
diseases.

288
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
That's right.

289
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,160
But at the same time, other things like this, like the emergency contraceptive and abortions

290
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
start popping up.

291
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
So ethics.

292
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Ethics, exactly.

293
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,480
So a very interesting topic, as we said, controversial, but at the same time, very much beautiful,

294
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,540
because we are talking about how our bodies work and how everyone came to existence.

295
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,880
And how babies are born.

296
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Everyone loves babies.

297
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
That's right.

298
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,600
So we're really interested to get your insights, your opinion about anything that we've talked

299
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,800
about today.

300
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,120
And if you have any other questions or comments, you can always reach us at EnglishPod.com.

301
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,960
Yeah, we hope to see you there.

302
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,440
And we hope this will start a nice conversation on our website.

303
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,320
But remember, keep it clean.

304
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
That's right.

305
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
All right.

306
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
So we'll see everyone there.

307
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Bye.

308
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:42,040
See you there.
