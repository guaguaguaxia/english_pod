00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,680
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,560
And today we're bringing you part 9 of our romantic drama suspense action series, I'm

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,040
Sorry I Love You.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,600
This is actually our penultimate lesson.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,200
Exactly, this story will end in part 10, so we're almost done.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
What's happening?

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,280
Well, I am pretty excited to find out, so why don't we go straight into the dialogue

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,480
and catch up with Steven and Veronica.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,880
Veronica, wait.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,120
Come on, honey, get back in the car.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,800
Let's talk it over, okay?

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,320
No, I'm tired of your lies.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,440
I don't know who you are anymore.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,840
Veronica, it's me, the man that has and always will love you.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,280
I'm sorry that I've lied to you, believe me.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,600
It's been hard for me as well.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,980
And time and again, I've thought of coming clean.

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,680
But I couldn't put you or my mission at risk.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
It's all over now.

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
My assignment is complete.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,800
And now I have to go back to India.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
What?

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,080
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,680
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,280
How could you deceive me like that?

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Yes.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,440
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now, but

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,920
I want to be completely forthright with you.

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,200
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
Veronica, will you marry me?

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,360
Come with me to India, baby.

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,840
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,560
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,520
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,880
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,400
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I love you.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:15,560
This is the last call for flight A15 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
We can't wait any longer.

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,360
You must board the plane.

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,440
Are you waiting for someone?

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,360
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:43,880
All right, so it seems like our poor Steven is going home by himself.

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
It's so sad.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
I know.

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,640
She proposed, she didn't accept, and now he's going back to India by himself.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,600
I think this must be one of the worst feelings in the world, wondering if the person you

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,240
love is going to show up at the last minute and realizing they aren't.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,480
I think it's very common of movies, you always expect the person to come running and show

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,600
up, but as you can see, our dialogues are more realistic, so it didn't happen in this

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
occasion.

57
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
More realistic.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Okay.

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,640
Anyway, let's not debate that topic.

60
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,440
Let's go straight into the language now with Language Takeaway.

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,960
All right, so today on Language Takeaway, we have six words that we're going to be looking

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,480
at and let's get started with the first one.

64
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,240
Okay, so we've got language about love and language about telling the truth.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,320
And the first one is a word about telling the truth.

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,440
So Steven said, I've thought of coming clean.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay, to come clean.

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,600
To come clean.

69
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,160
Now if I want to come clean, it means I want to...

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,920
You want to admit to something or to tell the truth about something you've been hiding.

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Exactly.

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,120
Okay, so I want to finally tell the truth or confess.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,120
So someone needs to come clean about who stole the chocolate out of the kitchen.

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,840
Okay, come clean.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,000
So Steven wanted to come clean on many occasions, but Veronica said, how could you deceive me

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,040
like that?

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,160
Deceive someone.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,220
How could you deceive me?

79
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,920
So to deceive someone.

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
All right, to deceive.

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,160
When you deceive somebody, you make them believe something that is untrue.

82
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,920
So you kind of trick them.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Okay, make them believe or see something that is not really true.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Exactly.

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,840
All right, so that's the verb, to deceive.

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,160
Now the noun, the action of doing this is called deception.

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
It was all a great deception.

89
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,040
Okay, so a big trick, something, a big untruth.

90
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
You deceived me.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
All right, very good.

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,280
And now the opposite of deceive.

93
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,520
Is to be forthright.

94
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Forthright.

95
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,400
So Steven wants to be completely forthright with Veronica.

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,120
Okay, I want to be forthright with you.

97
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,120
All right, when you are forthright with somebody, you are very honest and truthful with them,

98
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
right?

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Direct.

100
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
You don't defend everything directly.

101
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,960
So you don't hide it or soften it or anything.

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Very good.

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
So forthright.

104
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,480
All right, so three words about honesty.

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,120
Now we've got three words about love for you.

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,920
So Steven promised Veronica his undying love.

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
My undying love.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,160
My undying love.

109
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Now undying.

110
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,880
Well, I think it's pretty easy, right?

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
It won't die.

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,480
It won't die, exactly.

113
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,360
So he's offering her his love forever.

114
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
A very romantic phrase.

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,240
Very romantic.

116
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,500
And he also promised to be a devoted husband.

117
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Devoted husband.

118
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,720
I'll be the most devoted husband.

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Now this word devoted, what am I saying there?

120
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,040
So as a devoted husband, Steven really, really would love his wife.

121
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,280
He'd really look after her well and he would put all of his energy into his marriage, right?

122
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
Okay, so he would be very committed to her.

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,320
And work really hard.

124
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,840
Now can I change the noun husband for something else?

125
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Yeah, we can talk about a devoted friend.

126
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,360
Or a devoted father.

127
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,440
Or a devoted employee.

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Very good.

129
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
And our last word about love.

130
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,840
Well, Steven also promises to cherish Veronica.

131
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Okay, I will cherish you always.

132
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,500
I will cherish you always.

133
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,520
So if I cherish somebody like my girlfriend, what would that mean?

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,200
That means you hold her in your heart, like you really love her and you really respect

135
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,240
her and you hold her close in your heart.

136
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,800
Okay, so I respect her and maybe you don't take that person for granted.

137
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
To cherish someone.

138
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah.

139
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,720
Alright, so some nice honesty words, some nice love words and I think now we can move

140
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,360
on to some interesting phrases with Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,720
Alright, so Veronica was upset.

143
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,600
She didn't want to get back in the car and Steven said, let's talk it over, okay?

144
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
Let's talk it over.

145
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's talk it over.

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
To talk something over.

147
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Now if I tell you that I want to talk it over, what am I saying?

148
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,840
Well obviously you want to talk about it, right?

149
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,160
But you want to talk about it for some time.

150
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,500
To really talk about all of the problems and the issues and everything.

151
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,680
So to try and make things clear.

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Exactly.

153
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Alright.

154
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,720
So when he was confessing, he said, time and again I've thought of coming clean.

155
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,560
So this phrase, time and again.

156
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,680
Time and again.

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Time and again.

158
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,120
So that's basically the same as saying again and again or many times.

159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Right.

160
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,360
So time and again I've thought of quitting smoking but never really have done it.

161
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,720
So you've thought many times of doing it.

162
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Time and again.

163
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Yep.

164
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,160
Alright, so let's go to our next phrase.

165
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,440
Now Veronica said, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

166
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,240
At the drop of a hat.

167
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
At the drop of a hat.

168
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,000
So this is a very interesting and colloquial way of saying immediately.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,960
So why don't we hear a few examples of how this is used in English.

170
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,920
Example one.

171
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,000
My boss expects me to come into work at the drop of a hat.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Example two.

173
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,520
Laura is always willing to help me at the drop of a hat.

174
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,280
Example three.

175
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,200
I can't leave at the drop of a hat.

176
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
I need time to prepare.

177
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,080
Okay, so as you can see, you can change it for different things but basically you're

178
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
saying I can't do something immediately.

179
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah, and it is almost always attached to this idea of doing something or going somewhere,

180
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
being somewhere.

181
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Very good.

182
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
At the drop of a hat.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,280
Alright, now our final phrase here for this lesson.

184
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,600
So Veronica was saying I can't go to India at the drop of a hat and she also said I just

185
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,280
can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

186
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,840
Okay, a foundation of lies.

187
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,480
To build something on a foundation of lies.

188
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
Now this is interesting.

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,280
Let's take a look at this.

190
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Foundation what is that?

191
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,080
Well you know you have a house, right?

192
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,400
And the part that's in the ground that supports the house is the foundation.

193
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,440
Okay, so it supports the entire structure.

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Right.

195
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
So here she refers to the lies as the foundation.

196
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,200
And that's no way to start a strong relationship, is it?

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Exactly.

198
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,240
So we use it metaphorically in this way but we can always, but we always have to say it,

199
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,560
but we always have to use the verb build.

200
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay, so it's basically to make something on a base of something else, right?

201
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,760
So for example, a strong relationship is built on a foundation of trust.

202
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,480
Or this country was built on a foundation of liberty.

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Very good.

204
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
So always use foundation with built.

205
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Very good.

206
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Very interesting.

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,580
And well I think we should listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll

208
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,120
come back and talk a little bit more about Veronica and Steven.

209
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,720
Veronica, wait.

210
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,400
Come on, honey.

211
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,720
Get back in the car.

212
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,320
Let's talk it over, okay?

213
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
No.

214
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm tired of your lies.

215
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I don't know who you are anymore.

216
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,480
Veronica, it's me, the man that has and always will love you.

217
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
I'm sorry that I've lied to you, believe me.

218
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,600
It's been hard for me as well and time and again I've thought of coming clean.

219
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,300
But I couldn't put you or my mission at risk.

220
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
It's all over now.

221
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,400
My assignment is complete and now I have to go back to India.

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
What?

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
Are you kidding?

224
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,320
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

225
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,680
How could you deceive me like that?

226
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Yes.

227
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:56,040
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now but

228
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,520
I want to be completely forthright with you.

229
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,760
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

230
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,320
Veronica, will you marry me?

231
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
Come with me to India, baby.

232
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,440
I can't make it for everything that's happened but I can promise you my undying love.

233
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,680
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

234
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,200
Stephen, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

235
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,160
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,520
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

237
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,040
I do love you but I can't go with you.

238
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
I love you.

240
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:51,200
This is the last call for flight A15 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

241
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm sorry, sir.

242
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,800
We can't wait any longer.

243
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,000
You must board the plane.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,080
Are you waiting for someone?

245
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I was but I don't think she's coming.

246
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,040
So Marco, I think I see a bit of a tear there in the corner of your eye.

247
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm very sad.

248
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,960
I can't believe he proposed and she just said no.

249
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Just like that.

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,280
Well, it's not supposed to happen.

251
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:30,320
Plus, he was inviting her to India and exotic getaway and promising.

252
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,240
Exotic getaway for the rest of her life.

253
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,760
Well, what do you think will happen?

254
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,520
Part 10, it all ends.

255
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,680
So do you think they all just keep on living their separate lives?

256
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,480
Will they meet again?

257
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Who knows?

258
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,000
