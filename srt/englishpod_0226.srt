00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,640
My name is Katrin, and today we've got some kids for you in this dialogue.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,360
They're doing something that's very common in America.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm not so sure if it's common elsewhere, but we'll find that out later.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,280
So today we're going to ask for money because we are having a fundraiser.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,080
So this is a very interesting word.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,160
Why don't we take a look at it in Vocabulary Preview?

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,320
So a fundraiser is a thing.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
It's an event.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,400
It's something that you do at a school or a business to try and collect money for a

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,520
special event or charity.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
That's right.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
So money, you can also say is funds, right?

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
And that's what you're trying to do.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,920
You're trying to collect.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,560
You're trying to gather a lot of money or funds in order for, like you say, some sort

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,640
of objective purpose.

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
Right.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,920
So it's not just like we're having a fundraiser to earn more profits this year.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,040
It's usually an event that's for some kind of charity or good cause.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,360
So for example, the company is having a fundraiser for Jenny's child because he's sick and they

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,960
can't pay for medical care.

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,040
So a fundraiser is for a good cause.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Exactly.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,000
So that's what this dialogue is all about today.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time and we'll be back in a bit.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,680
Okay, Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,840
I did it last time.

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,040
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,880
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
the pizza party.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,040
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,200
Yes, but...

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,080
Just go already.

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
No one's coming.

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Try again.

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,760
Maybe there's no one home.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,200
Of course there's someone home.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,080
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Hello?

42
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Anybody home?

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,080
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,320
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,160
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalogue anyway.

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,120
CDs of old people singing Christmas songs and special crackers and cheeses and boxes

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
of chocolate.

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
You don't like chocolate?

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Not this kind.

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
They've got weird names like ganache and praline.

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,880
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
These people are being very rude.

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,840
Finally, someone's coming.

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
They don't look too happy.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Hi, sir.

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,160
Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
What grade are you kids in?

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Grade 7.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Can't you read?

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
No soliciting.

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:54,560
Alright, so obviously the kids are selling candy and a lot of different things for their

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
new playground.

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
That's the fundraiser, right?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,760
So they use a lot of interesting words and phrases there.

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,440
Why don't we take a look at a couple of them on Language Takeaway.

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,240
Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Well, the first word is one that Marco, you've already talked a little bit about today.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
We talked about fundraiser, to raise.

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Well, we do have the verb here, to raise enough money.

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,700
So raise is a verb that means to collect or gather or to get.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
That's right.

74
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,820
So you wouldn't really say we are collecting money or we are gathering money.

75
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,920
You say we are raising money for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
That's right.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,600
And the reason we don't say we are earning money is because you're not doing any work.

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Right.

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,080
Really, you're not going to the job at 9 o'clock and leaving the job at 5 o'clock.

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,440
You're actually asking people for donations.

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Exactly.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
So that's what you're doing.

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,760
You are raising money.

84
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,080
And now moving on, another way that you can help people maybe through a charity or donation

85
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,000
is also to sponsor.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
To sponsor someone or something.

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,200
Okay, so people can sponsor events or people and companies can also do this as well.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,560
So to sponsor someone is basically to give them money in support of a cause.

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,160
For example, have you ever done one of those 5K runs or 10K runs?

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,600
Did you have to collect sponsors basically to find people who would help pay money for

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,700
you to do this run?

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,760
Not personally, but I know people who have, who actually get companies interested and

93
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:40,440
maybe that person, for example, is going to run 5K in this race in order to raise money

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,800
for victims of some serious illness.

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
And so they get sponsors, they get companies to donate money for this cause.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Right.

97
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,900
You could have a person or a company sponsor you, they could be your sponsor by giving

98
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,080
you money that you can then use for this charity or special cause.

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
That's right.

100
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,680
So the difference between a fundraiser and to sponsor something or someone is that sponsoring

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,800
is not always for a charity or for some sort of non-profit cause, right?

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,840
We have many sponsors for concerts or for sporting events.

103
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
That's right.

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,740
So oftentimes when you see athletes, they have their sponsors or their sponsors logos

105
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,680
written all over their jerseys, the clothes that they wear.

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,440
So for example, if you're watching Formula One racing, you see the Ferrari and the bank

107
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
emblems and all these different things.

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
That's right.

109
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,120
So those are different ways of sponsoring events or people.

110
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,360
And now moving on, we have a word that's not really related to money and fundraisers, but

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,220
it's a very interesting word and very common.

112
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,640
When the kids mention that they're selling a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.

113
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Tacky.

114
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Tacky.

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,080
So we're going to hear this a lot and the interesting thing about the word tacky is

116
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,840
that it means something different to everyone.

117
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,360
So what I think is tacky might be just normal for Marco and what Marco thinks is really

118
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
tacky might be something that I actually like.

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,020
And so tacky is basically a bad thing.

120
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,040
It means something is not good looking or not very fashionable.

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,120
It's like in bad taste.

122
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,360
But as you say, taste is something subjective, right?

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,080
So maybe for example, sometimes we say that when girls wear too much makeup, it's very

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,080
tacky, bright red lipstick and blue eyeshadow.

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Exactly.

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
So a guy might say, oh, that's so tacky.

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,480
Whereas another person might not think it's tacky at all.

128
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,240
So this happens a lot and we use this word a lot with decorations, for example, for someone's

129
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,720
house, you may describe it as tacky or a restaurant or a bar.

130
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Right.

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,920
So for maybe sometimes those Italian restaurants that have the red and white checkered table

132
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,400
claws and the pictures of the Italians with the mustaches, I might think that's a little

133
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,720
bit tacky.

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,040
But maybe you think it's cute.

135
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Right.

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,680
So something that's tacky.

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,400
And as we say, people use it all the time.

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,920
And it's not necessarily a bad thing.

139
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,480
You can just say, oh, it's a little bit tacky or I think this thing is a little bit tacky.

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Okay.

141
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,240
And that's it, right?

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Solicit.

143
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Solicit.

144
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Okay.

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,960
So a little bit of a language takeaway, towards the end of the dialogue, when the kids were

146
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,760
reading the sign, the sign said, no soliciting.

147
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
And they didn't understand what that means.

148
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,240
What does it mean when you have a sign that says no soliciting?

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Okay.

150
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,920
So to solicit is to try to sell something or to offer a service.

151
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,840
So basically the sign means, please don't come to my house and sell me stuff.

152
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,900
For example, we have door to door insurance salesmen or makeup salespeople.

153
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,280
And these people go to your door and they try to sell you their product.

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,160
And no soliciting means, don't come to my house.

155
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm not going to answer the door if you're trying to sell something.

156
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,600
So to solicit is to try and sell something.

157
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay.

158
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,400
But usually in person, trying to make a sale uninvited, right?

159
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,840
Because if you're a businessman and you have a meeting, a sales meeting, you're not really

160
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,560
soliciting with that other person.

161
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,680
No, this is basically trying to sell something to a stranger.

162
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Exactly.

163
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Okay.

164
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Very good.

165
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
So a lot of interesting words there.

166
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,320
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.

167
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,200
Okay, Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

168
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,360
I did it last time.

169
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,960
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

170
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,420
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win

171
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,880
the pizza party.

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,520
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

173
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,720
Yes, but...

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,160
Just go already.

175
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,280
No one's coming.

176
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,540
Try again.

177
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,860
Maybe there's no one home.

178
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,300
Of course there's someone home.

179
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,120
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

180
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Hello?

181
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,340
Anybody home?

182
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,760
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

183
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,640
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,640
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalogue anyway.

185
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,920
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments, CDs of old people singing Christmas songs

186
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,440
and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
You don't like chocolate?

188
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Not this kind.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,000
They've got weird names like ganache and praline.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,280
These people are being very rude.

192
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Finally, someone's coming.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
They don't look too happy.

194
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Hi, sir.

195
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,320
Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,240
What grade are you kids in?

197
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Grade 7.

198
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,360
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

199
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
Can't you read?

200
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,560
No soliciting?

201
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,640
Alright so now we're back and we have four key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

202
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Fluency Builder.

203
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, this first phrase is a pretty common one.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,120
We wanted to make sure that everyone was comfortable with the verb that goes with doorbell.

205
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,200
So Marco, what do you do to a doorbell?

206
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,920
You ring the doorbell.

207
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
You ring the doorbell.

208
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
So you don't touch it, you don't press it.

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,560
You can press it, but you ring the doorbell.

210
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
That's the verb.

211
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,400
Okay, so for example, when I was little, my brother and I always used to fight about who

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,640
could ring the doorbell.

213
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Really?

214
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Yes.

215
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,360
I loved ringing the doorbell and so did he.

216
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,600
Do you do the long ring or do you do the...

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

218
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,520
You do it like that.

219
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
The annoying ring.

220
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,120
Yeah, so to ring the doorbell.

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
Alright, alright.

222
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,800
And well, going back, when we were talking about no soliciting, you said that salespeople

223
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,720
go door to door selling things.

224
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,960
So this is an interesting phrase and it's a fixed phrase, going door to door.

225
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Well, think about it.

226
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,120
So a salesperson who wants to sell maybe some makeup goes to one house and no one wants

227
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,500
to buy any makeup there.

228
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,080
So she goes to the next house.

229
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,320
So she's going from house to house.

230
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,600
But we don't really say house to house because she's going to your door to offer the makeup.

231
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,080
So we just say going door to door.

232
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,400
That means going to strangers' homes in order, one door after the next, to sell something.

233
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Very good.

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
You go door to door.

235
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,720
So for example, someone can go door to door asking for some sugar.

236
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
That's right.

237
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,660
Or we could say he is a door to door salesman.

238
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Door to door salesman.

239
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Very good.

240
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,800
Alright.

241
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,540
And now we have an interesting question and it's a very good one because it's a question

242
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,360
that comes up a lot.

243
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,240
When somebody asks you, if you're studying for example, what grade are you in?

244
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
Okay, what grade are you in?

245
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,560
So in the American system, for example, we have the very, very bottom, grade K, which

246
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,720
is kindergarten for maybe a five-year-old.

247
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
And at the very top, we have high school, grade 12.

248
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,080
And so in between we have one, two, three, four, five, you know, and up.

249
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,920
And so basically to find out what year in school a student is, you have to ask him or

250
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
her, what grade are you in?

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Right.

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,400
So then the person would say, I'm in sixth grade, I'm in eighth grade.

253
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,500
But this is the way you ask this question for school as you said, a kid that's maybe

254
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,240
five years old all the way to 18 years old in high school.

255
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
What grade are you in?

256
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,060
Now if you're in university and you want to ask your friend what year of university that

257
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,400
person's in, then you say, what year are you?

258
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
What year are you?

259
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah, you don't say grade.

260
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,400
So basically grade refers to like what you said, Marco, those first 12 years of school.

261
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,760
And so we call them, we thought, no, we don't call it grade 12.

262
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,840
So you could ask anybody under the age of 18, what grade are you in?

263
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,360
But when you go to university or when you're talking about university students, it gets

264
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
a little bit different.

265
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,000
So you can say, what year are you in or what year are you?

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,120
So if you're not sure about someone's age and you maybe think they're in college, you

267
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,280
can ask them, what year are you?

268
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,480
But generally anyone under 18, what grade are you in?

269
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Okay, good.

270
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
All right.

271
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,400
And our last phrase, and this is kind of an expression, right?

272
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,080
Goodness sake, for goodness sake.

273
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,720
Okay, so let's look at the context.

274
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,240
The kids say, we're in grade seven.

275
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,000
And the person at the door says, then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,760
Right, for goodness sake.

277
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,720
So this is an expression that's used to indicate maybe you're a little bit frustrated.

278
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes.

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Right.

280
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,000
So it's like, come on, or my goodness, or for Pete's sake.

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,920
So we have many ways of saying, all right, come on, I'm a little tired of this.

282
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Right.

283
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
You're irritating me.

284
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Right.

285
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,120
So basically the person's saying, you are too old for this.

286
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
You're too old for this.

287
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
You should read what it says on my door.

288
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
No soliciting.

289
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Right.

290
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
And so the person's angry.

291
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Right.

292
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Because these kids are trying to sell her something when clearly she has a sign that

293
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,840
says no soliciting.

294
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
That's right.

295
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Okay.

296
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
A lot of interesting phrases there.

297
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,440
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue for the very last time, and we'll be back

298
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,840
to talk with you a little bit more.

299
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:10,480
Okay, Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell.

300
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,640
I did it last time.

301
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,840
I hate going door to door and I hate asking for money.

302
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,720
But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that our class can win

303
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
the pizza party.

304
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,720
You do want to have a pizza party, don't you?

305
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes, but...

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,880
Just go already.

307
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
No one's coming.

308
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Try again.

309
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,600
Maybe there's no one home.

310
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,040
Of course there's someone home.

311
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,800
There are two cars in the driveway and I can see lights on in the house.

312
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Hello?

313
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Anybody home?

314
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,920
We would like to know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser.

315
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,120
50% of the profits go towards the new school playground.

316
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,040
I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalogue anyway.

317
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,560
It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments, CDs of old people singing Christmas songs,

318
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,920
and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.

319
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
You don't like chocolate?

320
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Not this kind.

321
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,280
They've got weird names like ganache and praline.

322
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Look, I just saw someone walking around inside.

323
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
These people are being very rude.

324
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,480
Finally, someone's coming.

325
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,400
They don't look too happy.

326
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Hi, sir.

327
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,960
Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to...

328
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,520
What grade are you kids in?

329
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Grade 7.

330
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,680
Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?

331
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Can't you read?

332
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
No soliciting?

333
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:33,560
All right, so door-to-door salesman.

334
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,080
I think this used to be a very American thing.

335
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,440
I think back in the 50s, you would always see movies where this was actually a profession.

336
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
That's right.

337
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,680
People would go door-to-door selling hairbrushes or magazine subscriptions, pretty much everything.

338
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, you still see it sometimes.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,960
Some people sell insurance or there are a lot of religious door-to-door salespeople

340
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,200
who want to sell religious books or magazines.

341
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,120
But I think it was much more popular in the 1950s because people didn't really use their

342
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,000
phones as much to sell things.

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,480
It was cheaper to have someone drive his car to your neighborhood and then go to every

344
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
single house.

345
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,720
But yeah, it's a very interesting job.

346
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,240
I think it'd be very lonely.

347
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,680
And also, I think, well, now maybe that's been reduced a lot because now you have the

348
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
internet.

349
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,320
Oh yeah, well the internet means that the salespeople come to you without you having

350
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,880
to get up.

351
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,720
So basically, you're sitting at home in your pajamas and you can order a TV and some clothes.

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,200
But it's very interesting because I remember you would have all these door-to-door salesmen.

353
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,080
For example, I had one visit me once who was selling me encyclopedias.

354
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Really?

355
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,000
A big collection of like, I don't know, 37 books or more.

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,640
It was a huge amount of books, encyclopedias.

357
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,160
And I don't know if you see that anymore.

358
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
Not really, not in the States.

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,480
I don't know if anyone buys physical, huge encyclopedias to have in their home.

360
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
No, only collectors perhaps.

361
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Maybe.

362
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
So it's a very interesting profession.

363
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,200
I don't know, in the United States, as you say, it's not very common anymore.

364
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,800
Very little, maybe specific services.

365
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
But this is interesting.

366
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,760
Maybe in your country, this is still a big thing.

367
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,800
Yeah, let us know.

368
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,600
In your country, are door-to-door salespeople still common?

369
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,640
Do you see them?

370
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,200
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

371
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
We hope to see you there.

372
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
All right, bye-bye.

373
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,720
Bye-bye.
