00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,360
My name is Catherine and today we've got a very special lesson for you all about time.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
That's right.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,280
We're going to concentrate a little bit on some specific points of grammar this time

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,280
and we're going to talk about the morning routine, what you do in the mornings.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Well, let's take a look first at the word routine.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,440
This is our vocabulary preview for today.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,240
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,960
Alright so a routine or the morning routine.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,240
What is a routine?

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,080
A routine is basically your habit for a certain period of time.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,640
So for example, your routine in the morning is what you do when you wake up.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
Get breakfast and go to work.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
You can also have an evening routine.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,520
It's what you always do before you go to bed.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Exactly.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Everyone has a routine, what they do in the mornings, maybe what you do at night before

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,960
going to bed.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,360
So that's what we're going to talk about today.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
That's right.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
You can also have an exercise routine.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
So basically anything with steps.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,600
One, two, three, four, five, that you always do the same way.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
That's a routine.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Exactly.

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Right.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
So that's what we're going to take a look at today.

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:26,080
Let's actually jump right into our dialogue and listen to Stephanie's routine.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
Stephanie did you just get to school?

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,760
That was about an hour and a half ago.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
This happens all the time.

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Why do you always take so long to get ready in the mornings?

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,880
It's a skill.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,560
What can I say?

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
I don't know why.

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,600
I just have a long routine.

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,080
Please explain because it makes no sense to me.

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,760
How can a girl's routine be so complicated?

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,120
You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you're out the door.

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Half an hour tops.

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,640
Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
I don't.

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,080
I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings.

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,140
Every day I wake up and head straight for the shower.

47
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,040
Every second day I wash my hair.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,720
If it's a hair washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
oily.

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Then, I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too.

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under 20 minutes.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew.

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I take a long time to get dressed in the morning.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do

55
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,300
it in the morning.

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,520
In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,920
so then I have to style my hair.

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,800
From time to time I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blow dry it straight.

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,360
And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat iron it to keep it

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,000
from frizzing.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,240
That's another 20 minutes or so.

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,400
After that, I have my daily makeup routine.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,000
True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
up to class in sweatpants.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,480
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Not funny.

67
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,040
Alright, we're back.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
So obviously she has a very complicated routine.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,920
I don't know if all girls are like this.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not like this, but I think a lot of girls, and some guys are.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
I don't want to be sexist here.

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,680
I know some guys who take their time in the morning and are very, very particular about

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
the way that they look.

74
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Really?

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Wow.

76
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,800
So, obviously everyone has their morning routine in different ways.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,120
And it was interesting to see how she described it.

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,440
So why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,640
Language Takeaway.

80
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,240
So today's Language Takeaway, like I said at the beginning of the podcast, is all about

81
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
time.

82
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,760
So we're going to look at some of these important time adverbs.

83
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
That's right.

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,280
These are called adverbs of frequency.

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,040
And basically, they are telling us how we do things.

86
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,800
If we do something all the time or if we never do something.

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
Or everything in between.

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Exactly.

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,600
So the first couple we have today are very, very common words.

90
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
You're going to hear these a lot.

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,280
The first one is frequently.

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,680
Okay, frequently.

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,320
So, if you do something frequently, consider it to be about 75% of the time.

94
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
Maybe a little bit more, almost 85% of the time.

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Right.

96
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,680
So it's not always, but it's very often.

97
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,560
So for example, so I frequently forget to take my keys when I'm leaving the house, which

98
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
is a very big problem.

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Exactly.

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,520
So considering out of seven days, maybe you forget your keys five days.

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Not so good.

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
All right.

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
So that's frequently.

104
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,120
Now let's move on to another one that's actually a lot less.

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,720
We talk about seldom.

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,960
Well, Marco has told me that he seldom forgets his keys.

107
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,960
That means he almost always remembers them.

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Right.

109
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,600
So seldom is a negative adverb.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
It's saying that almost never.

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Okay.

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,080
So if I say, for example, I seldom go to the movies.

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
That's too bad.

114
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
I like the movies.

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Right.

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,640
Well, that means that I maybe go to the movie theater once a month.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Yeah.

118
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Not very often.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Seldom.

120
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Not very often.

121
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Seldom.

122
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
All right.

123
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,480
Now going back to a positive adverb of frequency, we have often.

124
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,520
You described frequently as very often.

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
That's right.

126
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,320
You can also say, I often forget my keys or it often rains in tropical places.

127
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
This means this is a common thing.

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Exactly.

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,680
So again, let's consider it to be about 70 to 80% of the time.

130
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,000
Now with pronunciation, some people like to pronounce often, right?

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,560
They kind of leave out the strong T sound.

132
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,620
Well, other people say often.

133
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
That's right.

134
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,620
Both forms are correct, right?

135
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Yes, they're both correct.

136
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,640
So you're safe using either of these.

137
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Right.

138
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Okay.

139
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,600
And our third adverb of frequency, no, our fourth.

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,720
And our fourth adverb of frequency is also a positive one and we say usually.

141
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,360
Usually means this is something that you do pretty consistently.

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,840
I usually brush my hair before I go to sleep.

143
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,520
That means not always, but almost every day.

144
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Right.

145
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
So let's consider out of seven days, you do it six times.

146
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah.

147
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I usually do this.

148
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Okay.

149
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,920
So usually is again, very, very common.

150
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,480
And something in between maybe 60% of the time, 50% of the time we say regularly.

151
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,640
Well, I think of the word regularly as being very closely related to regular.

152
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,840
So basically if I have a schedule, I do the same thing every day.

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,580
I do it regularly.

154
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,480
But sometimes there's a special occasion.

155
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,720
For example, I regularly run five kilometers after work when I go to the gym.

156
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
But sometimes when I want to go out with my friends, I don't run.

157
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
So it's not always, but it is pretty regular.

158
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Exactly.

159
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,880
So regularly means you do it very often, but there are some exceptions.

160
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Okay.

161
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,760
Now those are adverbs of frequency, but we have a couple of other phrases that are very

162
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,900
similar so we want to take a look at those as well.

163
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,840
Let's go back to the beginning of Stephanie's routine when she said that every day I wake

164
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
up.

165
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Okay.

166
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,440
So every day means 100% of the time every single day.

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,920
Monday to Sunday.

168
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Exactly.

169
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,140
So obviously you wake up every day.

170
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,200
Or I brush my teeth twice every day.

171
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,920
So that's 100% of the time.

172
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Now if we say every second day, what does that mean?

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,660
That means Monday yes, Tuesday no, Wednesday yes, Thursday no, or any day.

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,520
So basically she says I wash my hair every second day.

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,960
That means one day I wash my hair, but the next day I don't.

176
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,600
The day after that though, I wash it again.

177
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Every second day.

178
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay.

179
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,160
So you can say every second day and I think you can also say every other day.

180
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Every other day.

181
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
So every other day or every second day.

182
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,560
He calls his mother every other day.

183
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Very good.

184
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Alright.

185
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,600
And she also said that every now and then I remember to choose my outfit.

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Okay.

187
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Well, this one's interesting.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,080
This is not very frequent.

189
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,000
This is basically saying sometimes.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,300
Sometimes.

191
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,560
So now and then.

192
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,920
Every now and then means I sometimes do it, I sometimes don't do it.

193
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,400
Every now and then I really want to eat chocolate so I buy a candy bar.

194
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Okay.

195
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,520
So basically you want to eat chocolate twice in a month.

196
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,680
Yeah, not very often.

197
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Not very often.

198
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Okay.

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,600
And another one that's very similar is from time to time.

200
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
So Marco said that he doesn't go to the movies very frequently.

201
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,520
So he goes from time to time.

202
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Right.

203
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,120
So I can say I seldom go to the movies or I can say I like to go to the movies from

204
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
time to time.

205
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,560
That's right.

206
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
Or this girl is describing her appearance.

207
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,760
She says from time to time I put my hair up.

208
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,520
So that means most of the time.

209
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
That means sometimes it's down.

210
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Sometimes it's up.

211
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Right.

212
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,960
So as you can see there are many different ways of describing the frequency or how many

213
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,880
times you do certain actions or your routine.

214
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,200
So you can use this with a lot of things when you're describing.

215
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,480
And we encourage you to try some of these new ones because a lot of English learners

216
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,840
use the same time adverbs whenever they speak.

217
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,520
So try and really use some of these and challenge yourself.

218
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Exactly.

219
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,360
All right so that's all we have for language takeaway.

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,920
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder.

221
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,280
Fluency Builder.

222
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Okay so using some of these adverbs I could say I can say I regularly make a pot of coffee

223
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
in the morning.

224
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Okay.

225
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,480
So a pot of coffee.

226
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,120
You regularly make a pot of coffee.

227
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,080
That means you like to drink coffee every day.

228
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
That's right.

229
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,560
I always need my cup of coffee in the morning.

230
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,440
So I usually make it first thing.

231
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
So a pot of coffee.

232
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,320
We know what a cup of coffee is.

233
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
But a pot of coffee.

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
What is a pot?

235
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,560
A pot is basically the container that you use when you brew coffee when you make it.

236
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,200
So you put the coffee beans in the machine and instead of having a cup underneath you

237
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,640
have a bigger container that's a pot.

238
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,720
You can also have a pot of tea.

239
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Exactly.

240
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
It's many cups.

241
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Usually eight or ten cups.

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
All right.

243
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
So what is that verb?

244
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
To brew coffee.

245
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,480
I think it's a very nice kind of fancy way of saying making coffee.

246
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Brew a pot of coffee.

247
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm brewing some coffee.

248
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
All right.

249
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,840
So apart from coffee and all of these things, let's take a look at some of the specific

250
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,600
phrases that she used when she was talking about her hair because I think her hair is

251
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
very complicated.

252
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,880
It is very complicated.

253
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,400
Sometimes she washes her hair.

254
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Sometimes she doesn't wash her hair.

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,600
Sometimes she blow dries it straight.

256
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,280
Okay, so to blow dry means that you use a blow dryer.

257
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
That's right.

258
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,640
This is a machine that uses electricity to blow hot air on your hair so that your hair

259
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,480
will dry quickly.

260
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,440
But you can blow dry your hair in many ways.

261
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,840
Some people have curly hair and they have special tools for making their hair curly.

262
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,520
But she says she blow dries it straight.

263
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,920
That means she makes it straight with hot air.

264
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Right.

265
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,800
So I think the way you do this is you take the blow dryer and a brush and you brush while

266
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
you blow dry, right?

267
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Yep.

268
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Awesome.

269
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Making lines.

270
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,960
See, I know a little bit about this even though I don't have long enough hair for this.

271
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
No, I guess.

272
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,680
Well, maybe you are secretly one of those guys who has a routine like this woman.

273
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,920
I don't think I can take this much time in the shower and brushing my hair.

274
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,480
But moving on, actually, I also know this next phrase, to flat iron your hair.

275
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,880
Okay, so flat iron is a noun and a verb.

276
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,320
So I use a flat iron or I can flat iron my hair.

277
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,840
This is a tool that we use that's very, very hot.

278
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Think of an iron.

279
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,640
It's very, very hot and it basically presses my hair and makes it very, very, very thin

280
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,320
and flat and straight.

281
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,520
So I think people that have straight hair don't need to really flat iron their hair.

282
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,920
Nah, but if you have very curly hair, then you need it.

283
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,180
So what's the difference?

284
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
Give us the insight here.

285
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,800
Why wouldn't you just blow dry it straight?

286
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,200
Why do you need to flat iron it?

287
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Because a flat iron makes it more flat.

288
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,280
It makes your hair stick together more and it's much, much, much hotter than a blow dryer.

289
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,660
So I guess if you use a blow dryer, then you have puffy hair or like the next word that

290
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,760
she described, frizzy hair.

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,920
Okay, so the adjective to describe this kind of hair is frizzy.

292
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,680
For example, when it's very rainy, my hair is frizzy.

293
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,080
That means that it sticks out.

294
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,120
It's very thick and not straight.

295
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,200
It's not curly, but it's messy.

296
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
It kind of inflates.

297
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
That's right.

298
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,480
It's like a little balloon.

299
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,560
But the verb here is to frizz.

300
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,320
So my hair is frizzing.

301
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,640
And that means that it's getting like this, bigger or inflated.

302
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
That's right.

303
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,240
So girls who have this problem have it worse during very humid or rainy days.

304
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
Not so bad when it's dry.

305
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,920
Okay, so I actually have a little bit of frizzy hair.

306
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,040
That's why I have to use some sort of hair gel or mousse.

307
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,880
See, it's not because I'm vain.

308
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,240
It's just because if I don't use this, I'll come in looking like a lion.

309
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I think I might have to insist that that happens sometime soon.

310
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,120
We can take a picture and put it on our website, EnglishBot.com.

311
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
For sure.

312
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,120
All right, so why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.

313
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,560
Stephanie, did you just get to school?

314
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,360
But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning.

315
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,080
That was about an hour and a half ago.

316
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
This happens all the time.

317
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,040
Why do you always take so long to get ready in the mornings?

318
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,200
It's a skill.

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,880
What can I say?

320
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,920
I don't know why.

321
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,880
I just have a long routine.

322
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,400
Please explain because it makes no sense to me.

323
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,080
How can a girl's routine be so complicated?

324
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,440
You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you're out the door.

325
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,000
Half an hour tops.

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling.

327
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,080
I don't.

328
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,400
I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings.

329
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,440
Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower.

330
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,340
Every second day, I wash my hair.

331
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,000
If it's a hair washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
oily.

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,660
Then, I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too.

334
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,320
Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under 20 minutes.

335
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,080
Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew.

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I take a long time to get dressed in the morning.

337
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Every now and then, I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually, I do

338
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,600
it in the morning.

339
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,120
In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry,

340
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,200
so then I have to style my hair.

341
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,080
From time to time, I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes, I blow-dry it straight.

342
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,640
And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat iron it to keep it

343
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,280
from frizzing.

344
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,520
That's another 20 minutes or so.

345
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,680
After that, I have my daily makeup routine.

346
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
True.

347
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,520
I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up

348
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,280
to class in sweatpants.

349
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,800
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?

350
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,280
Not funny.

351
00:15:50,280 --> 00:16:00,880
Alright, so actually talking about morning routines, and we've given you so many tools,

352
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,280
I think it would be a great idea if our users came to our site, EnglishPod.com, and posted

353
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,400
a part of their morning routine, trying to use as many adverbs of frequency as possible.

354
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,560
That's a great suggestion, and to get you all started, I could give you a little bit

355
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
of my routine.

356
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,840
Alright, let's hear it.

357
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Every morning when I wake up, I turn off the alarm, which is very loud, and I take a shower.

358
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,000
I always brush my teeth, and I usually brew a pot of coffee, although sometimes I don't

359
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,160
have time to brew my coffee, and I wait until I arrive at my office.

360
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,480
I seldom choose the clothes I will wear the night before.

361
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,440
I almost always choose them in the morning, and generally I ride my bike to work, but

362
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
not always.

363
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,560
Okay, I think in the winter you seldom ride your bike to work.

364
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
Every once in a while I ride it.

365
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Alright, see?

366
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,040
You have a perfect example there of more or less what we expect, but also it would be

367
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,240
interesting to see if you have any other type of routine.

368
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,920
I know some people wake up in the morning, and the first thing they do, they always walk

369
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
their dog, for example.

370
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,280
Oh, that's very nice.

371
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,800
Other people are very hungry, so they almost always eat right when they wake up.

372
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,920
I eat before I brush my teeth.

373
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Smart, actually.

374
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,200
Yeah, alright, so we want to hear from you guys.

375
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Come to EnglishPod.com.

376
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
We'll see everyone there.

377
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Bye.

378
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:39,000
Take care.
