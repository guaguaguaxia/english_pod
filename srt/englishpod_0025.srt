00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820
Hello English learners and welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,220
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,640
And today we're bringing you a great upper intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
That's right.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,380
We're going to talk about a topic that's been in the news recently and this topic is...

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,380
The bird flu.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,380
That's right.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,380
So can you tell us what the bird flu really is?

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,900
Basically the story is a lot of chickens and birds keep getting this disease and they've

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,840
managed to pass this disease to humans.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,940
And the fear is that humans will start to pass this disease to each other and a huge,

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,020
huge number of people in the world could get really sick.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,020
Okay.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,020
Yes.

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,020
So it sounds scary.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,820
Well, it may be a little bit scary, but we do have some interesting language.

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,280
We've got language to talk about a disease and language that you might use in a planning

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,540
meeting at work.

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,540
All right.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,180
So let's start by looking at our vocabulary preview for this dialogue.

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,180
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Okay.

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,020
The first word on our vocabulary preview today is contingency plan.

25
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,500
Contingency plan.

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Contingency plan.

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Contingency plan.

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,060
So a contingency plan is a...

29
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,520
A plan that you make to prepare for an emergency.

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,380
So like a backup plan.

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Exactly.

32
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,380
Okay.

33
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
Yep.

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,380
Contingency plan.

35
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,060
And our last word for the vocabulary preview today is pandemic.

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,060
Pandemic.

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,060
Pandemic.

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,340
Pandemic.

39
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,220
So a pandemic is something scary.

40
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,380
Well, yes.

41
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,180
It's an event where a disease affects a lot of people.

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,500
Like we're talking millions of people.

43
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Okay.

44
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,380
And it spreads very quickly and it goes international.

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Okay.

46
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,860
So a disease that spreads very fast and goes everywhere.

47
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
Exactly.

48
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,860
Okay.

49
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Pandemic.

50
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
Okay.

51
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
So we're ready to listen to our dialogue.

52
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,060
We're going to be at a business meeting where people are talking about a contingency plan.

53
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,220
Well, right.

54
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,540
Let's move to our next order of business.

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,300
As many of you are aware, in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding

56
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,980
this bird flu issue.

57
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,900
And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

58
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,660
Basically, we need to come up with a clear plan.

59
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,820
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business

60
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,340
functions in case a pandemic strikes.

61
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,900
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,780
Ralph, I'd like you to head up this project.

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Sure.

64
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
No problem.

65
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,780
What issues do you want me to consider?

66
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
Well, let's see.

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,940
There are a few points we need to be thinking about.

68
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,180
First, I'll need you to analyse our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact

69
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,620
an outbreak might have.

70
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,180
You'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

71
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,540
Think of ways to reduce employee-customer contact.

72
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,300
Perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

73
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,300
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right?

74
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,140
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

75
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,700
Hey, what about vaccines?

76
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,660
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?

77
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,620
Exactly right.

78
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:32,020
So I'll leave this to you and we'll review the draft plan in two weeks.

79
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Okay.

80
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:42,980
Does anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

81
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,580
Alright what an ironic meeting.

82
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,340
They are talking about the bird flu and they are going to have chicken.

83
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,140
Yes, after sneezing all over.

84
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,700
Yeah, I guess now we could take a look at our language takeaway for this dialogue.

85
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
Language takeaway.

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,620
We heard a lot of really useful language in this dialogue and right now we're going to

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,860
look at four different words from the dialogue.

88
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,660
The first one is critical.

89
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660
Critical.

90
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
Critical.

91
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,660
Critical.

92
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,740
We've got some examples of this word that will help us to understand the meaning.

93
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,860
So let's listen.

94
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,620
Example one.

95
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,180
It's absolutely critical that we increase our sales.

96
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,420
If not, the company will go bankrupt.

97
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,780
Example two.

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,900
We have a critical shortage of food.

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,460
If we don't get help, people will die.

100
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,300
Example three.

101
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
This is a critical step in the process.

102
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,460
You can't make a mistake here.

103
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,820
So when something's critical, it's basically really important, really urgent.

104
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Right.

105
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Okay, great word.

106
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Critical.

107
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,460
The next word we have is outbreak.

108
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Outbreak.

109
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,460
Outbreak.

110
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,300
An outbreak.

111
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,500
So an outbreak is a sudden start of a disease, right?

112
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Can I say, oh, I got an outbreak of flu.

113
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,340
Can outbreak describe one person?

114
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,860
No, an outbreak means that it's infecting a lot of people.

115
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Okay.

116
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
Not only one person.

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,500
So that we could say there was an outbreak of the flu at the office.

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Right.

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Which there was.

120
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Yeah.

121
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
A lot of people got sick here with the flu.

122
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah.

123
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Okay.

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,060
Why don't you tell us about our third word?

125
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Our third word is forecast.

126
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Forecast.

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
Forecast.

128
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,820
So to forecast basically means to predict.

129
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Exactly.

130
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,020
For example, you talk about the weather forecast.

131
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
Yep.

132
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
Okay, great.

133
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,420
And the last word for our language takeaway is vaccines.

134
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Vaccines.

135
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Vaccines.

136
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,420
Vaccines.

137
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,100
So vaccines are something we all had when we were children.

138
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
That's true.

139
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,420
They are injections that you get to prevent you from getting sick later.

140
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Right.

141
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,380
So an injection of medicine from your doctor so that you don't get a disease in the future.

142
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
Right.

143
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,900
When we are small, we get polio vaccine.

144
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Yeah.

145
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Or measles vaccine.

146
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Measles.

147
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Yeah.

148
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
A lot of common diseases.

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes.

150
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Okay.

151
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
So that's all for language takeaway.

152
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Some great language related to health and disease.

153
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,500
But we also heard some great business related words in this dialogue.

154
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
That's true.

155
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,260
There's a lot of words that you can use in a planning meeting.

156
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,300
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

157
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,540
Fluency Builder.

158
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,300
In today's Fluency Builder, we're going to look at four useful phrases.

159
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Now this first phrase you can use when you want to change the subject at a meeting.

160
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,140
Let's listen to what they said in the dialogue.

161
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,060
Let's move to our next order of business.

162
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,300
Let's move to our next order of business.

163
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,460
Okay.

164
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,260
So let's move to our next order of business.

165
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,900
It's a great way of saying let's move on.

166
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Exactly.

167
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Let's pass to the next topic.

168
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Great.

169
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,300
Speaking of passing to the next topic, we heard another really interesting phrase in

170
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
the dialogue.

171
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,620
Let's listen.

172
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,220
We need to come up with a clear plan.

173
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,140
We need to come up with a clear plan.

174
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,020
We need to think of a clear plan.

175
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
We need to come up with.

176
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Yeah.

177
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
Okay.

178
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,860
Our third phrase we heard in the dialogue is this.

179
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
Okay.

180
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,200
I'd like you to head up this project.

181
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,980
So this phrase head up.

182
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,260
This is a great phrase.

183
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,140
It means I'd like you to lead or take care of this project.

184
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Okay.

185
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:43,300
And the last phrase for fluency builder you can use when you want to give someone the

186
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,180
responsibility of a job.

187
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,260
We heard this.

188
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,780
So I'll leave this to you.

189
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,940
So I'll leave this to you.

190
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,260
So I'll leave this to you.

191
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,140
This is you take charge.

192
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Exactly.

193
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,320
I'll leave this to you.

194
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,060
So great way of delegating a responsibility.

195
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,580
And so we're going to leave you to listen to our dialogue a last time and be sure to

196
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:14,620
pick up all the great vocabulary that we just talked about.

197
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,900
Well right.

198
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,260
Let's move to our next order of business.

199
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,020
As many of you are aware in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding

200
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,980
this bird flu issue.

201
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:34,180
And it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan.

202
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,340
Basically we need to come up with a clear plan.

203
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,500
We need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business

204
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,060
functions in case a pandemic strikes.

205
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,540
So what I'd like to do is first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan.

206
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,020
Ralph I'd like you to head up this project.

207
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Sure no problem.

208
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,100
What issues do you want me to consider.

209
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Well let's see.

210
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,420
There are a few points we need to be thinking about.

211
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,900
First I'll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact

212
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,340
an outbreak might have.

213
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,900
You also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected.

214
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,540
Think of ways to reduce employee customer contact.

215
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,020
Perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

216
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,020
I guess you'll need me to forecast employee absences as well right.

217
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,300
And I'll think about the impact this will have on our clients.

218
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Hey what about vaccines.

219
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,380
Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees.

220
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,340
Exactly right.

221
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:44,620
So I'll leave this to you and well we'll review the draft plan in two weeks.

222
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Okay.

223
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:55,860
Does anyone want to order some KFC for lunch.

224
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Okay great.

225
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,820
So this contingency plan idea is really interesting right.

226
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah.

227
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,060
It makes sense for a company to prepare in case there is an outbreak of bird flu.

228
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,620
I mean they need to maintain their critical business functions even if all the employees

229
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
are sick.

230
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
Hey right.

231
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,300
I guess that's really important and you have to forecast all these possibilities like people

232
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,300
are going to be away from the office or even forecast less sales etc.

233
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
That's right.

234
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,460
The interesting thing is that businesses that may not actually be involved in food production

235
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,260
or raising chickens or something like that are making these contingency plans.

236
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,740
I find that really fascinating.

237
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,660
So it seems there is a lot of fear out there about the possibility of a pandemic.

238
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Yeah.

239
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Yeah.

240
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,100
We're going to come out with a vaccine so we don't have to worry about these things.

241
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
That's true.

242
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,020
But until then we'll have to create contingency plans.

243
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
That's right.

244
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,820
