00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,720
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a dream home.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,920
So building the home of your dreams.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,240
That's right and this lesson today is advanced so it might be a little bit hard and we're

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,080
going to be taking a look at not only some vocabulary related to your home or decorations

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,960
and stuff but also how to treat your loved one in a nice way or little nicknames.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Cute names, pet names.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So stay tuned.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,520
We'll be talking about very specific things having to do with building a home and home

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,040
remodeling.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,360
And so we'll hear this dialogue one time but when we're back in just a minute here we'll

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:52,760
be talking about what those things mean.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,160
Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, let's get straight to it.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,740
You have saved up your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,140
What did you have in mind?

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,800
A suburban bungalow straight out of the 60s.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,840
A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping, brick patio in the backyard with an old fashioned

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,680
grill, quaint lawn furniture and a swimming pool.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,520
A two car carport, pastel siding and a gable roof completed with white shutters and a white

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
picket fence.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,100
Uh, honey?

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,440
In the living room we would have moss green rugs and a fireplace with a stone mantle and

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,240
wood paneling on the walls.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,680
In the kitchen the cupboards would be a pale yellow and we would have a turquoise metal

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,400
oven and vinyl flooring.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Um, sweetie?

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
But I was thinking of more a modern style house.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,160
An open concept house all glass, wood, metal and concrete.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,600
But sweetums, there's always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,240
Besides it's just a fad.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,480
It doesn't have the homey feeling the old homes do.

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,680
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,280
It is relaxing and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,480
to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,640
We would have solar panels on the roof.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,440
Do you know how much those things cost?

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,800
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,960
And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,280
harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,980
the whole yard so we could grow our own food.

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,980
But buttercup, I thought you always said that you loved visiting your grandmother's house.

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,880
And I thought you, Mr. Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
advancement.

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Um, well, I am just going to get some coffee while you two keep discussing.

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,920
Alright we're back.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,760
So apparently the couple can't seem to agree.

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,160
He wants something different than what she does and in the end I think they were a little

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
bit irritated with each other.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
Doesn't this always happen though?

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,000
I mean my dream home is probably not your dream home.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,640
I don't know, it's weird.

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,640
But I mean you would probably have to, I don't know, compensate somehow or...

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,280
Well that's the beauty of compromise I think.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,280
You can go back and forth but with your loved one or your spouse you have to make some decisions

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,720
about what you want and what they want.

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,760
All you need to do is give a guy his own room in which he can decorate and do whatever he

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
wants with it.

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
That's all you need.

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
You mean you.

63
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
No, no, not me.

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,320
You want to decorate the house in any way you want, fine.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,080
But just give us one room, you know, like five meters by five meters where we can put

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
anything we want.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,120
A beer cooler, a TV, a PS3, a sound system, and a couple guitars.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah, probably, yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Yeah.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
That's enough.

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
You described it.

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
I've been to your house, I know.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Anyway, we've got a lot of great words here in Language Takeaway so let's take a peek

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,360
at some of those.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Language Takeaway.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
All right.

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,520
So the first word that we have or it's actually a concept, minimal landscaping.

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,400
Okay, so minimal is a style, minimalist actually.

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,840
And minimal landscaping is this kind of style of, well, designing your lawn or your garden.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
So minimal means not having adornments or decorations.

81
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Okay.

82
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,800
So it's kind of like the less is more type thing.

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Exactly.

84
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,520
So minimal architecture could be very simple, lots of clean lines, not much decoration.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,000
It's the opposite of something that's baroque and highly ornamented.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I don't like that.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm into minimal.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
All right, minimalist.

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Anyways, we have minimal landscaping.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,760
And while he's talking about his patio and an old fashioned grill, and he said quaint

91
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,200
lawn furniture.

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,640
Quaint is sometimes, well, it's usually kind of a bad thing.

93
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,640
We say something is quaint in the way of saying that it's cute, but we don't really like it

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,360
because it's maybe old fashioned or kind of old style.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,680
So oh, isn't that quaint?

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,480
It's something that people from the city often say about people in the country, at least

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
in America.

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,400
So, oh, because you know, I went to school on the East Coast and I'm from the Midwest.

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,760
So people on the East Coast would say, oh, your house is so quaint, small and cute and

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,440
old fashioned because they live in a big fancy New York apartment or whatever.

101
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,400
So quaint is usually something that's not the nicest.

102
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,360
So he's looking for some lawn furniture that's not like plastic or new.

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,560
It's more like old fashioned, maybe wood.

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Right.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
And kind of traditional and not fancy.

106
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Kind of simple.

107
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,520
Now, he's also talking about the house and he wants, well, a two carport, pastel siding

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
and a gable roof.

109
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,640
So now we know what a roof is, but what is a gable roof?

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,160
A gable is a thing, right?

111
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,040
And it's almost like an extension of the roof in certain parts.

112
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,360
For example, on a traditional Cape Cod style house, you have windows in the front that

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,640
they're not a part of the roof.

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
They're an extension.

115
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
They come out.

116
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
They're kind of popping out like eyes.

117
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Exactly.

118
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
They're coming out like eyes.

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,400
And so the roof, obviously you need a roof on top of those windows.

120
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,100
So that kind of roof, that little extension, that's called a gable.

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,320
And so there's a wonderful book that's famous in American history called The House of Seven

122
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Gables.

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,280
That means that on this roof of the house, there are seven different parts that come

124
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
out.

125
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Seven gables.

126
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
It's very unique.

127
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,000
Those houses usually look a little bit scary.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They do.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Victorian and imposing.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,180
All right.

131
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,000
So you have a gable roof.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Now you have shutters and a white picket fence.

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
This is typical.

134
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,400
Everyone talks about a white picket fence around their house.

135
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
That's right.

136
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,240
There was even a TV show in America years ago called Picket Fences.

137
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,180
And I think a picket fence is kind of this ideal in American culture about having your

138
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,680
own home in the suburbs and having your own space.

139
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,620
And so around your yard, around your garden, you have this white picket fence.

140
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,940
And so a picket is, I think, the pointed part.

141
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,400
So a picket fence is thin pieces of wood that stand in the ground and are connected to protect

142
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
your property from other people coming inside.

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Okay.

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
So that's a white picket fence.

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,120
You'll hear it all the time.

146
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,460
Usually in movies or in TV shows, they talk about having their own little house with their

147
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,160
dog and a white picket fence.

148
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Exactly.

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Two kids, two cars.

150
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
And a white picket fence.

151
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,820
All right.

152
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,060
So now the woman argued that she wanted something a little bit more modern.

153
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,800
And well, the guy said, you know what?

154
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,240
It's just wasted space.

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,440
And those types of homes are just a fad.

156
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,800
A fad.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,240
So a fad is something that is passing.

158
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,000
It's something that's popular for a short time, but then it goes away.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
It's not popular anymore.

160
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Right.

161
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
So...

162
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,400
For example, I think for a while, remember those shoes that used to have little red lights

163
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
in the back and the heel?

164
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Oh yeah.

165
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
LA lights.

166
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
LA lights.

167
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Those were a fad.

168
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,160
It was really popular for like a year.

169
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,920
Everyone had them, everyone wore them, and then they just went away.

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,600
One of my favorite fads of the 1980s were those shirts that would change color if the

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,320
room temperature changed color.

172
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
So if you go outside and it's hot, they would become bright pink.

173
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,920
But if you're in a cold room, they would go blue and green.

174
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,840
It was really fun, but they're definitely out of fashion these days.

175
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,760
Yeah, I don't think they wear them anymore.

176
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,340
So that's a fad.

177
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,880
Something that's temporary.

178
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
It's popular for a while.

179
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,360
So he called her house a fad and she says, well, what about your house?

180
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,640
All this vintage furniture.

181
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
What's vintage?

182
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Vintage?

183
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,560
Well, some people think that vintage is a fad.

184
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,520
A lot of people really enjoy buying vintage furniture or vintage clothing.

185
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Vintage means old.

186
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Old.

187
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,880
It's a nice way of saying old or like a nice or cool way of saying old.

188
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Yeah.

189
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,640
So it's almost like, for example, right now, 1940s and 50s clothes are very popular.

190
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,440
A lot of girls are into this kind of style.

191
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,680
So it's called vintage clothing because it's not from today's styles.

192
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,080
It's an old style.

193
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,440
Or you could even call those big flowing dresses from the 1970s vintage clothing.

194
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,720
So vintage furniture would be furniture that comes from a different time, a different era,

195
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
and it's popular now.

196
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Right.

197
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
They're popular now.

198
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
Or people like to buy them now.

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
That's right.

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,240
So they're special because they come from a different time.

201
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Okay.

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,600
So those are the words that we have for today on Language Takeaway.

203
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,120
Why don't we move on now to some pet names or some sweet ways that you can call your

204
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,840
loved ones on Fluency Builder.

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,360
Fluency Builder.

206
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,080
So the reason this dialogue is very funny is because we have these two people who are

207
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,040
clearly in disagreement about the kinds of furniture and house they want, but they're

208
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,480
being so nice to each other.

209
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,740
They have these cute names for each other.

210
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,520
So it's really funny.

211
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,160
It almost seems like they're newlyweds, but apparently they've been saving up their entire

212
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
life.

213
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,920
So maybe they're just one of those really loving couples.

214
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh, Sweetums, Cutie Pie, Cutie.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So that's the first one.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sweetums.

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sweetums.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,160
So obviously the main part of this word is sweet.

220
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,960
Sweetum, Sweetums.

221
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,400
And this is a way to say, hey, sweetie.

222
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Sweetums.

223
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Sweetums.

224
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
So you can say sweetie or sweetums.

225
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Exactly.

226
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,840
So that's a nice way of saying somebody.

227
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,960
Or you can go sweetie pie.

228
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Sweetie pie.

229
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
So pie is a food.

230
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
It's like a dessert.

231
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Pie is sweet.

232
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
It's a sweet.

233
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
So sweetie pie.

234
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Or you could say honey pie.

235
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Honey pie, sweetie pie.

236
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
So these are all cute.

237
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,560
And the nice thing about these kind of pet names, these cute names, is you can change

238
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,720
them if you want and they're yours.

239
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,920
So you could say honey pie, sugar bun.

240
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,840
They're silly, but there's no real rule.

241
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,040
But these are the most common.

242
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Right.

243
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,400
Sweetums and sweetie pie.

244
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Sweetie pie.

245
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Okay.

246
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,760
Now, moving on to something a little bit maybe more formal.

247
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Dearest.

248
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Dearest.

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
This makes me think of my grandparents.

250
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Oh, really?

251
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Dearest.

252
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,400
So dearest comes from dear.

253
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,520
Dearest is the most dear.

254
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,120
So someone who's the most important to you.

255
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Okay.

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,920
And so you could say mummy dearest, mother dearest.

257
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Oh, really?

258
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
You heard that somewhere?

259
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Oh, yeah.

260
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
Do people call their mothers like mother dearest?

261
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Mother dearest.

262
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
No, it's very 1930s.

263
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm so arrogant.

264
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,760
Well, it's an old time thing.

265
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,920
We do not say this anymore, but you can say, you know, dearest, would you mind moving the

266
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
car?

267
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I like the accent.

268
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,480
You're kind of like English.

269
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
All right.

270
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,800
And the last one, buttercup.

271
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
This is really popular.

272
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
It's really popular.

273
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,120
And you've heard this in a song before.

274
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
You want to sing the song?

275
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
No, you sing the song.

276
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Why do you build me up?

277
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Buttercup, baby.

278
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Okay.

279
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,720
So that was in a lot of movies.

280
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
The word is buttercup.

281
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,920
Also in the movie, the princess bride was the character of Princess Buttercup.

282
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,520
And so this is a sweet, you know, obviously a sweet thing.

283
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,200
I think a buttercup is a flower.

284
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Oh, really?

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Yeah.

286
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,920
And so these are all words you can use, names you could use with men and women, but buttercup

287
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,520
is mostly women.

288
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,360
I think the other ones are more general.

289
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,040
But do you think like, do guys say to their loved ones like, sweetum, sweetie pie?

290
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Oh, yeah.

291
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Yeah?

292
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Oh, yeah.

293
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
All right.

294
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,800
So I guess guys, if you want to be really sweet and you want to win over the hearts

295
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,240
of the ladies, you can use these words as well.

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,320
Another popular one is babe, which is more of a young person thing to say.

297
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Yeah, I think it's more modern as well.

298
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,040
Honey or babe?

299
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Baby.

300
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
Baby.

301
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
You're verging on not so sweet.

302
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,480
Yeah, but like, hey, baby, how are you?

303
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
It's like, nice.

304
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
But not like, hey, baby.

305
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
All right.

306
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, we're going to leave you with that thought and go listen to this dialogue one more time.

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,680
We'll be back in a moment.

308
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,080
Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, let's get straight to it.

309
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,680
You have saved up your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home.

310
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,060
What did you have in mind?

311
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,720
A suburban bungalow straight out of the 60s.

312
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,760
A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping, a brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned

313
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,600
grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool.

314
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,120
A two-car carport, pastel siding, and a gable roof, completed with white shutters and a

315
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,680
white picket fence.

316
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,020
Uh, honey?

317
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,360
In the living room, we would have moss green rugs and a fireplace with a stone mantle and

318
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,160
wood paneling on the walls.

319
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,580
In the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale yellow, and we would have a turquoise metal

320
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,400
oven and vinyl flooring.

321
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,720
Um, sweetie, but I was thinking of more a modern-style house, an open-concept house

322
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,320
all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

323
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,240
But sweetums, there's always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes.

324
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,160
Besides, it's just a fad.

325
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,400
It doesn't have the homey feeling the old homes do.

326
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space.

327
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,200
It is relaxing, and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed

328
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,400
to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer.

329
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,580
We would have solar panels on the roof.

330
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,360
Do you know how much those things cost?

331
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,740
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

332
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,880
And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally

333
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,200
harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover

334
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,900
the whole yard so we could grow our own food.

335
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,920
But Buttercup, I thought you always said that you loved visiting your grandmother's house.

336
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,800
And I thought you, Mr. Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological

337
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
advancements.

338
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:50,160
Um, well, I am just going to get some coffee while you two keep discussing.

339
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Alright we're back.

340
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,960
So apart from this decorations and stuff, do you agree with the vintage home, the more

341
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:05,000
like minimalist thing, or do you like the open concept one, the bigger one?

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,040
I love the look of minimalism, but as a place to live, it's not comfortable.

343
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,160
And so when I think of an aesthetic that I like, a look that I like, I really like kind

344
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,560
of dark wood, velvety, 19th century kind of, I think of old Vienna.

345
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
You like Castle Dracula.

346
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,080
No, not dark.

347
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,160
I like things to be open.

348
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,640
And I like a lot of natural light, but I also like oversized kind of heavy furniture and

349
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,280
really luscious fabrics and things like that.

350
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,480
So that's my...

351
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm actually completely different because I do like this open concept.

352
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,880
I like those houses that, I like the way they look inside as well as outside when they're

353
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,560
kind of squared, big windows, clean lines.

354
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,920
Inside is like, for example, in the kitchen you have polished aluminum or polished steel

355
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:06,040
furniture in the kitchen, as well as a lot of white and red or black, especially.

356
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,200
I kind of like that kind of open spaces.

357
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Primary colors.

358
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Flat screen TVs on the wall and stuff like that.

360
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Remote controls.

361
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Ikea lamps.

362
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah, you know, like those remote controls where you can open your curtains, your TV

363
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
and the lights all at the same time.

364
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,480
I kind of like that stuff.

365
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Cool.

366
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,080
