00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,340
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,600
And today we have a very special guest in our studio, Daini.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,040
Hi everyone, I'm Daini.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,020
Daini is part of our EnglishPod team and today she's going to help us with this Chinese New

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,100
Year's lesson.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,720
It's an intermediate lesson but it has a lot of cultural aspects about Chinese New Year.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,080
So that's what Daini is going to help us out with today.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,180
Yes, today we're going to learn a little bit about Chinese New Year in English and we're

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,800
also going to learn some language for describing things that we're excited about.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,200
Okay, yeah, I'm excited to hear the show.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:47,760
Okay, so let's listen to the dialogue now and then when we come back we'll explain everything.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,680
When do I get to visit grandma?

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,960
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,720
Ah, right, sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,440
Of course I miss grandma too.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,360
I bet she's going to teach me how to play mahjong.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,840
Hey, dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,440
We're going to have the best fireworks.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,360
Son, firecrackers aren't toys.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,720
They are dangerous.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,800
No, fireworks are awesome.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Wow, don't you remember?

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,240
Last year when I set off the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
your mother.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug, that's all.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Really?

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,520
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,800
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,760
Hey, I offered last year.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Well, I...

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,520
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
I can't wait.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,880
I'm going to have so much money.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
I want a new transformer.

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
No, two transformers.

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm going to surprise.

43
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Wheeljack.

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I'll get a PSP game.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:10,080
Okay, so Chinese New Year.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
A lot of exciting vocabulary here.

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
Before we get into describing it, let's look at the vocabulary that we saw.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
In language takeaway.

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,320
Language takeaway.

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,160
The first word on language takeaway, dumplings.

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Dumplings.

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Dumplings.

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Dumplings.

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,920
Well, in Chinese, we call it shuǐjiǎo, and it's a very traditional Chinese food

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
and it's getting very famous now.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes, so it's basically small pieces of dough with maybe some meat or some vegetables inside.

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,480
And then they are boiled.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Usually in a soup.

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
In a soup.

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
And then they also have fried dumplings.

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Which are really good.

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,040
So, if you know Italian food, they're really similar to a tortellini.

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
Exactly.

65
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,400
Or in Latin America, it's very similar to maybe an empanada.

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,920
It's like a small little empanada.

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,520
Marco, what's our next word?

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,160
All right, our next word, firecrackers.

69
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Firecrackers.

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Firecrackers.

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Firecrackers.

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:19,040
This is a firecracker.

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Firecrackers are so common in China.

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,880
We use it all the time in all occasions.

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,600
And especially on the New Year's Eve, traditionally people use it to scare off the evil.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Evil spirits.

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
The evil spirits.

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Yeah.

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Okay.

80
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,280
So on Chinese New Year, there are millions of firecrackers.

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Millions of firecrackers.

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
Now, there are also a lot of fireworks.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fireworks.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Fireworks.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fireworks.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,960
So, fireworks are similar to firecrackers.

87
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
But they have lots of light.

88
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
A light.

89
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Yeah.

90
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,240
They go up in the air and explode and you see lots of nice colors.

91
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Beautiful colors.

92
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Yeah.

93
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,560
Very popular in 4th of July in the United States.

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Or New Year's Eve.

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
New Year's Eve.

96
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Mm-hmm.

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Mm-hmm.

98
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Fireworks.

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
Okay, now let's look at our last word.

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
Set off.

101
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,960
Set off.

102
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Set off.

103
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Set off.

104
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,080
So, this is the verb you would use with firecrackers.

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Yeah.

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,600
It means like explode the firecracker.

107
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Right.

108
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
Set off the firecracker.

109
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,000
Set off the bomb.

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Set off fireworks.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Well, let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,040
And this time, it'll be a little bit slower so that you can understand the language a

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,840
bit better.

114
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,320
When do I get to visit Grandma?

116
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,960
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

117
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Ha-ha.

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Right.

119
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,280
Sounds to me like you are more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

120
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,480
Of course, I miss Grandma, too.

121
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,720
I bet she's going to teach me how to play Mahjong.

122
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,080
Hey, Dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
We're going to have the best fireworks.

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,080
Son, firecrackers aren't toys.

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
They're dangerous.

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
No, fireworks are awesome.

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Whoa.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,760
Don't you remember last year when I set off the firecrackers?

130
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,880
You covered both your ears and hid behind your mother.

131
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,920
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug.

132
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
That's all.

133
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Ha-ha.

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Really?

135
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Hey, I offered last year.

138
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Well, I...

139
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,080
Anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

140
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,600
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
I can't wait.

142
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm going to have so much money.

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,760
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

144
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,360
I want a new transformer.

145
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,120
No, two transformers.

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,600
The Optimus Prime and maybe the Wheeljack.

147
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,280
I'll get a PSP game.

148
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Ha-ha.

149
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,240
I'll buy the entire class lunch at McDonald's.

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, so we saw some really great phrases of describing excitement, right?

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,560
So let's start with Fluency Builder.

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,960
Fluency Builder.

153
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,920
We have four phrases for you today and the first one is, I'm so excited about.

154
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm so excited about.

155
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm so excited about.

156
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,360
So when you say, I'm so excited, it means that you are...

157
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm really happy.

158
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
That something is going to happen.

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
Yeah, so happy you can't relax.

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,920
Right, so you could say, I'm so excited about our vacation next month.

161
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm so excited about opening all my presents.

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
Exactly, so excited.

163
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,080
Now we also saw another really great word, very similar to I'm so excited.

164
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah.

165
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm really looking forward to.

166
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,360
I'm really looking forward to.

167
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm really looking forward to.

168
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm really looking forward to.

169
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,320
So this is a little bit less than excited, right?

170
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
A bit less strong.

171
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Right.

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,560
So you would say, oh, I'm really looking forward to meeting your new girlfriend.

173
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,320
Or you can say, I'm really looking forward to seeing that movie.

174
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
Exactly.

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
So it means you're a little bit excited but not so excited.

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,060
Yeah, you're happy about something that's going to happen in the future.

177
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,040
Now let's look at our next phrase and it's very similar to excited.

178
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,400
I can't wait.

179
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
I can't wait.

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,080
I can't wait.

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
I can't wait.

182
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
So this is very, very similar to I'm so excited.

183
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,320
Yes, when you're so excited for something, you can't wait for it.

184
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Right.

185
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Let's listen to some more examples of I can't wait.

186
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Example one.

187
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm so excited.

188
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,480
I can't wait to see you.

189
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Example two.

190
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,960
Mmm, smells delicious.

191
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,280
I can't wait for dinner.

192
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,800
Example three.

193
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,300
I can't wait to open my presents.

194
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,840
So we can use it again the same way.

195
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,720
I can't wait to go on vacation next month.

196
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't wait to open all my presents.

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Exactly.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
Now our last phrase.

199
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
I bet.

200
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I bet.

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,640
I bet.

202
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,800
I bet.

203
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
B-E-T.

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Bet.

205
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Bet.

206
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
So when you say I bet, it means that you're pretty sure about something.

207
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,920
You predict it will happen.

208
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Right.

209
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,000
So let's listen to some more examples of I bet.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,360
Example one.

211
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,440
I bet I'm going to get so much money for Chinese New Year.

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,040
Example two.

213
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Robert Slade.

214
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Where do you think he is?

215
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,720
I bet he's stuck in traffic.

216
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,640
Example three.

217
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,960
I bet the boss is going to give us a big bonus this year.

218
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,760
Well, I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the third time.

219
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:24,960
And then when we come back, Danny's going to tell us all about Chinese New Year.

220
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,040
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

221
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,920
When do I get to visit grandma?

222
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,120
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

223
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Right.

224
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,920
Sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,640
Of course I miss grandma too.

226
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,600
I bet she's going to teach me how to play Mahjong.

227
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Hey, dad.

228
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,040
Are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

229
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
We're going to have the best fireworks.

230
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

231
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,560
Son, firecrackers aren't toys.

232
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,000
They are dangerous.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, fireworks are awesome.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wow.

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Don't you remember?

236
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,440
Last year when I set out the firecrackers, you covered both your ears and hid behind

237
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
your mother.

238
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,400
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug.

239
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
That's all.

240
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Really?

241
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,680
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

242
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

243
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey, I offered last year.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, I...

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,520
Anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

246
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,760
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

247
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
I can't wait.

248
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm going to have so much money.

249
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,920
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

250
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I want a new transformer.

251
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
No, two transformers.

252
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Optimus Prime.

253
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Wheeljack.

254
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I'll get a PSP game.

255
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Ha ha.

256
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm going to get a new game.

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,260
So Daini, what are these red packets of money about?

258
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,000
So in Chinese, we call it 紅包 hóngbāo, and it's basically a bag full of money.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,320
Why do you get money?

260
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
As a gift.

261
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
As a gift.

262
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Wow.

263
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,680
Do children get it though?

264
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,160
Many children get it.

265
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Wow.

266
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,120
If you're a university student and you haven't got a job yet, then you can still ask for

267
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,840
紅包 hóngbāo from your parents or your relatives.

268
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,440
So is there some meaning to this gift of money?

269
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Well, it is believed that children have to put these red envelopes under their pillow

270
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,280
on New Year's Eve to scare away the evil spirits.

271
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,760
Again, like the firecrackers.

272
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Again, evil spirits.

273
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,360
A lot of evil spirits in China.

274
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,760
So Daini, how much money would a kid get for Chinese New Year?

275
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,680
Well, when I was little, the best year I got was 3000 RMB.

276
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,280
Which is like almost...

277
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
500 dollars.

278
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Wow.

279
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Yeah.

280
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,960
I was so rich at that time.

281
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,000
Wow, amazing.

282
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,760
What about this game, 麻將 mājiǎng?

283
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Have you played it?

284
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
No.

285
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
No.

286
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,840
And again, it's a very traditional Chinese game and you will see senior people always

287
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
gathering along the table.

288
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
So old people.

289
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Old people.

290
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,720
So it's like a board game, kind of like chess?

291
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,840
It's kind of like chess, but they have like specially made chess.

292
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
It's very different.

293
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Okay.

294
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,800
So I want to know more about the fireworks and firecrackers on Chinese New Year.

295
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,040
Okay, usually we buy firecrackers.

296
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I believe fireworks are more expensive.

297
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,080
So we play firecrackers, 炮仗 pàozhàng.

298
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,120
And usually we do it right after midnight.

299
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,320
So 12 o'clock.

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
It's very loud.

301
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:42,800
And say for example, I personally don't even dare to stay close when they set off the firecrackers

302
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,600
because it's just way too loud.

303
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,960
And everyone starts to light them.

304
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
So it's like...

305
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
No, it's amazing.

306
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,760
I've seen Chinese New Year three times in China.

307
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,600
And each time I've just been amazed.

308
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,680
It's so cool and so noisy and so awesome.

309
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
I mean, you've got to visit China to see this.

310
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,840
Yeah, it's a really cool festival.

311
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,560
And definitely playing with firecrackers is always fun.

312
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah, maybe a little bit dangerous.

313
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Well everyone, we've just learned about how New Year's is celebrated in China.

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
And we want to know how do you celebrate New Year's in your country?

315
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Exactly.

316
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,280
How do you welcome the New Year?

317
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,440
How do you scare away evil spirits?

318
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,440
So come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave us your comments.

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
That's right.

320

Dany, Erica and I will be there to answer all your questions.

321
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,440
So be sure to send us some comments.

322
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,980
Well everyone, thanks for listening.

323
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
And until next time, bye.

324
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,980
Bye.

325
00:13:35,980 --> 00:14:00,200
Hi, bye.
