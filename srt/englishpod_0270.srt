00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson all about going shopping.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Today we are going with a guy to a shop and he's buying a new suit.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,060
Okay, so lots of great words for men or for buying clothes for your husband or brother.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,600
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
We'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello, sir.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,160
What can I do for you today?

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Hello.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
I need a new suit.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,240
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,280
No problem.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,200
We have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Great.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,120
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Very well, sir.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Sure.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,960
I also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Very good.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,880
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,400
for your suit and shirts.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,080
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,340
So a very simple dialogue about a guy needing a suit and he talked to the tailor apparently

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,000
about a couple of things.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,960
Now why don't we take a look at some of those words in Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,040
Well, first of all, a tailor is a person who makes clothes.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,440
So in this case, a man who makes suits.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,320
And the first thing that we have to talk about is the kinds of suits that he has.

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,600
He says, we have a broad selection of suits.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Okay.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,240
So this adjective, broad, what does that mean?

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
It means wide.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,520
You know, you can have a very broad street.

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,040
That means many cars can fit across it.

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
But in this case, we're talking about a selection.

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,560
So that means a broad selection of suits, very, very many suits to choose from.

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Okay.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,480
So for example, if you go to a music store where they sell CDs and stuff like that, they

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,920
might, they will have a broad selection of music.

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,080
So you can have rap and hip hop and R&B, etc.

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
That's right.

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Or the iTunes store has a broad selection of music.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,600
You can choose basically anything.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
That's right.

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Okay.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,000
So he has a broad selection of suits and he said, well, great.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,760
I actually need a three-piece suit.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Okay.

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,120
So there are different kinds of suits.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,200
Some just have two pieces like pants and a jacket.

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
But the kind that the man wants is a three-piece suit.

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,640
So that means there's a jacket, pants or trousers, some people might say, and a vest.

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Okay.

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,120
So yeah, you've probably seen this.

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,160
They look very nice.

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,480
Basically under or over your shirt, you wear a vest.

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,440
And so if you wear a vest with a suit, it's called the three-piece suit.

61
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,840
You know who I'm thinking of right now who always wears three-piece suits?

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,040
He's very famous, a football player actually.

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Beckham?

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Yes.

65
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Really?

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
David Beckham.

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,440
I don't know if you guys watched the World Cup, but in the World Cup, David Beckham was

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,480
always wearing a three-piece suit.

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Wow.

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
In that heat, that's amazing.

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Yeah.

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
Okay.

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
So we have a three-piece suit.

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,080
Now, we don't have a four-piece suit, do we?

75
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
I don't think so.

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
I don't know.

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I don't think so.

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
I don't know.

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,120
But basically, tux, you have like the, on your waist, the cummerbund.

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, cummerbund.

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
That's what it's called.

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Okay.

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Well, that's for a tuxedo.

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,280
Now, moving on, we talk about the materials of the suit.

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,320
And he said, well, I preferably want something made from Italian cashmere or wool.

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Okay.

87
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,480
So Italian is an adjective that describes things that come from Italy.

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,680
And Italy is very famous for its fabrics and silk.

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,200
So in this case, we're talking about Italian wool.

90
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,280
Cashmere is a very expensive, very soft kind of wool.

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Okay.

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,960
And wool is basically a sort of material that comes from the sheep, from the hair of the

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
sheep.

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
That's right.

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,920
And so different sheep, different animals have different kinds of wool, and these have

96
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
different prices.

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
So some are more expensive and some are cheaper.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Cashmere is very expensive.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Very good.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,400
And he also is offered some shirts and he's like, yeah, sure, I'll take some shirts.

102
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,720
And I also need some silver cuff links.

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Okay.

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,000
So when you close your shirts by your wrist, you usually have a button or in some cases,

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
something a little bit more fancy.

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
And when it's more fancy, it's called a cuff link.

107
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Yes.

108
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
You've probably seen it.

109
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,240
It looks like a small metal button that you can remove from your shirt.

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
It looks a lot better.

111
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,760
It's kind of hard to explain, but just imagine on your wrist, you have a small metal button

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,840
that you can close your shirt at the wrist.

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
That's right.

114
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,120
And some people have very, very fancy ones with special pictures.

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,560
So you could have, for example, a car, if you love cars, or a diamond cuff link with

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
a diamond on it.

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
That's right.

118
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,920
So he wants a cuff links made of silver.

119
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,080
And also he wants a pair of silk ties.

120
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Okay.

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,780
So a pair of means two.

122
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,280
He wants two different silk ties.

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,000
And the tie is basically something that you put around your neck.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
Men wear these usually to the office.

125
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
And ones that are made of silk are usually more expensive.

126
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
That's right.

127
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,160
So a silk tie.

128
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,240
And okay, so we've pretty much covered everything that he needs.

129
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,680
He wants a very nice suit with a lot of great accessories.

130
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,040
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

131
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,920
Hello, sir.

132
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,240
What can I do for you today?

133
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
Hello.

134
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I need a new suit.

135
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,360
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
No problem.

137
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,280
We have a broad selection of suits, all tailor-made, so it will fit perfectly.

138
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,360
Great.

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

140
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,320
Very well, sir.

141
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Sure.

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
I'll also take some silver cuff links and a pair of silk ties.

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Very good.

145
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,000
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,720
for your suit and shirts.

147
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,440
So in Fluency Builder today, we have three very useful phrases that you can say when

148
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,880
you're with the tailor at the store buying a suit.

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,480
The first one is, to look sharp.

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
That's right.

151
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,080
He says that he has a job interview, and he wants to look sharp.

152
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,800
Okay, so to look means to have the appearance of, but sharp, what does this mean?

153
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,840
Basically take it as a chunk or as a phrase, and if you look sharp, it means you look smart,

154
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,680
you look good, you look clean, you look very nice.

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
So this is normally something we say to men.

156
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,720
You look really sharp today.

157
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
Or I want him to look sharp.

158
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,780
I'm going to buy him a nice silk tie.

159
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,780
That's right.

160
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,760
So to look sharp, as I said, to look very nice, very clean, very handsome.

161
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,280
Okay, so looking sharp.

162
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,440
And well, when we were talking about the suit, the person mentioned that all the suits are

163
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
tailor-made.

164
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,120
All right, this is a very important phrase if you want to go shopping for clothes that

165
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
are made for you.

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,560
So something is tailor-made if the sizes are made only for fitting you.

167
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
That's right.

168
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,560
If you go to a department store and you buy a suit off of the shelf or the rack, it's

169
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,720
not tailor-made.

170
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,040
But if the tailor makes it, he sews it to your size, then it's tailor-made.

171
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,640
You know, wedding dresses are tailor-made.

172
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
Special suits are tailor-made.

173
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,760
So this is usually an expensive kind of clothing.

174
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,080
Okay, so it basically means the tailor, the person, made it especially for you.

175
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,120
And the opposite, as you said, would be off the rack.

176
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Off the rack.

177
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,520
And this means that when you go to the store, you pick something, you like it, and you buy

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
it.

179
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
No one is going to sew it to make it fit you.

180
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
That's right.

181
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,200
And this is actually how most of us get our clothes.

182
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,400
You go to the department store, you get a pair of jeans, a t-shirt.

183
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,080
Obviously all that stuff is off the rack.

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,200
It's not tailor-made for your size.

185
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
That's right.

186
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Okay.

187
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,440
But if you really want to get something tailor-made, you need to be able to talk to the tailor

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
about it.

189
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,720
So he will usually say, let me take your measurements.

190
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,800
This is our next phrase.

191
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
That's right.

192
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,400
The tailor mentioned that he wants to take them over there and take his measurements.

193
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,440
So when the tailor says, I want to take your measurements or I need to take your measurements,

194
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,480
what does that mean?

195
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,640
That means I need to measure parts of your body to help make this suit.

196
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:04,160
So he'll normally measure your shoulders, your waist, your hips, and how long things

197
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
will be.

198
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
So your arms and your legs.

199
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,600
And these are all important measurements to know how big or how small to make the suit.

200
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
That's right.

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,920
So you need to take your measurements or you can also say you have to get measured.

202
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
That's right.

203
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,280
So to get measured or to take someone's measurements.

204
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,880
These are key phrases for buying a tailor-made suit.

205
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Very good.

206
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Okay.

207
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:38,840
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk some more.

208
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Hello sir.

209
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
What can I do for you today?

210
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Hello.

211
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
I would like to order a new suit.

212
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,080
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

213
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,120
No problem.

214
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,960
We have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

215
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Great.

216
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,960
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

217
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,040
Very well, sir.

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

219
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Sure.

220
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,800
I'll also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

221
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Very good.

222
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,720
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns

223
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,200
for your suit and shirts.

224
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,160
So do you have any tailor-made suits, Marco?

225
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,000
I actually don't.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I haven't...

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,040
Here to the office, I never wear a suit.

228
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,720
We don't really need to wear suits all fancy.

229
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,560
And there have been very few occasions where I've needed a suit.

230
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,840
So I actually don't have a suit at the moment.

231
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Not even one?

232
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Not even one.

233
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Not even off the rack?

234
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,680
I have a few at home and I just haven't used them.

235
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
And probably they wouldn't fit anymore.

236
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,560
This is the problem with getting things tailor-made as well.

237
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,040
The thing is that with a tailor-made suit, usually it's made to get bigger or smaller.

238
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,520
So maybe the shoulders and the arms are the same, but if you gain weight or you lose weight,

239
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,080
the tailor can make those small, small changes.

240
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
That's right.

241
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,120
Actually, I had a friend who got some tailor-made jeans.

242
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,440
And I think that would be nice because sometimes, I don't know, jeans for me, they don't fit

243
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
well.

244
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Me either.

245
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,960
There's a very famous company that does tailor-made jeans that I was thinking about going to because

246
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
I hate buying jeans off the rack.

247
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
Yeah, they usually don't fit.

248
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,800
Either the waist is too...

249
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,160
If I need a bigger waist, but then everything is too baggy and it just doesn't look right

250
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
or everything is too small.

251
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,880
So I think this is a very interesting thing, although I don't know how expensive it would

252
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,160
be because getting tailor-made clothes is relatively expensive.

253
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,900
It can be very expensive, although that's usually in America or in Europe.

254
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,440
In places like India and China, I think it's much more common to have things made to fit

255
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
you, tailor-made.

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,200
This is a very interesting subject and actually, we are wondering if maybe you know a tailor,

257
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,360
you are a tailor or you've gotten things tailor-made for you.

258
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Maybe you got married recently and you had a tailor-made tuxedo or a tailor-made wedding

259
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
dress.

260
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
That's right.

261
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
So let us know.

262
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
We can be found at EnglishPod.com.

263
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
We hope to see you there.

264
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
All right.

265
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Bye, guys.

266
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,120
