00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,520
And my name is Catherine and today we're talking about something we talk about every

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,680
year.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,640
Every year after Christmas or well during the Christmas holidays, we talk about New

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,400
Years, New Years Day and a very important topic, New Years Resolutions.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,080
Alright, so we're not going to preview anything today.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,600
It's all in the dialogue but when we come back, we'll be talking more about what you

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:41,520
hear and some of the great phrases you can use at the New Year.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,000
Did you read this?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,320
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
and family.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,800
Why would that be funny?

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Well think about it.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,800
We are a society that is always on the go.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,560
Not because we have to but because we want to.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Why?

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,720
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,080
goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,960
I don't agree but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
yourself.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
What's the point?

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,360
We always make New Year's resolutions and by February, we will have forgotten about

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
them.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
It's pointless.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,600
Well maybe then you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,780
What about you?

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,880
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,280
to be jogged in.

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Well I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,120
Alright, great, we're back.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,440
So this is very typical.

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,560
A New Year's resolution that you make but then people don't really stick to it, etc.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
They don't?

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Usually they don't.

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Alright, but you're probably wondering what is a New Year's resolution so why don't

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,840
we take a look at this word and many more on Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,440
Okay, so New Year's resolution, let's break this phrase down.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
The first phrase is New Year's.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:14,040
So the New Year is January 1st in the West and it is celebrated on the 31st of December

43
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,960
at night when the clock changes to the New Year and a New Year's resolution, remember

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,240
that S there, is something that you want to do or to change in the New Year.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,440
It's a fresh start.

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Okay, so you pretty much, the verb that you use there is to resolve to do something.

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,600
So my New Year's resolution is to go to the gym every day.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,360
It's like a promise to yourself.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Right, so and this is very common right among Americans.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,660
They try and because it's a New Year, it's a fresh start so they want to start doing

51
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,660
something great.

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,360
Exactly, we can talk about this at the end but a lot of companies try to use this to

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,640
sell Americans stupid things so we'll get there in a minute.

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,320
But the two people in this dialogue are talking about the idea of spending more time with

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,240
friends and family.

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,880
And the other person says, well sometimes it's hard to do that because you have to provide

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,440
your family with goods and services.

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,640
This phrase goods and services is very common especially in economics and sociology.

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
So what does this mean?

60
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
And they go together, right?

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,720
So goods are tangible items, things that you buy, you know like food or you know clothes,

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
a TV, etc.

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Stuff.

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Stuff.

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,280
And services of course are other things like for example going to the doctor or the dentist

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
or any other service you get.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,400
So service usually includes another person doing something for you.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,880
But you might not actually get something physical like a TV if you pay for it.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,280
So goods and services, it's included in this phrase always goods and services.

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Very good.

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,480
And well moving on as we mentioned with the New Year's resolution, we had that verb there,

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,560
to resolve.

73
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,360
So what does it mean if I want to resolve?

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay well to resolve as we said is to decide or to promise yourself to do something.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,240
So it's a decision that you don't want to change your mind about.

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,880
For example, I, this year, I've resolved to quit smoking.

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,640
That means I've made a decision for myself and I'm going to do it.

78
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Okay, very good.

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
It's very strong.

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,000
And not to be confused with like to solve, right?

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,400
It has no real relation there, right?

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,720
No, resolve, to resolve to do something is to have a strong passion or interest in doing

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,480
something for yourself or changing an action.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Very good.

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,680
And well our last word for language takeaway is brand new.

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,280
A brand new, something that's brand new.

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,240
Brand new, so buy a brand new car.

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,400
Come down to Captain's car lot.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,800
So brand new is something we hear a lot in marketing.

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,920
It's also something that, well these words just go together very often.

91
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,520
And something is new, okay, you just bought it or it just came out.

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,300
But something that's brand new is really fresh, really new.

93
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,960
So brand new, a brand new car, a brand new watch, etc.

94
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,360
A brand new movie.

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,840
A brand new movie or brand new cereal.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,680
Have you ever tried it?

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Very good.

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,100
So great phrases there.

99
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Very good.

100
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
So great words there.

101
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:24,020
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with three phrases.

102
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,480
Did you read this?

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,800
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
and family.

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,280
Why would that be funny?

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Well think about it.

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,280
We are a society that is always on the go.

108
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
Not because we have to, but because we want to.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why?

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,160
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with

111
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,600
goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
yourself.

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
What's the point?

115
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,280
We always make New Year's resolutions and by February we will have forgotten about them.

116
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
It's pointless.

117
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,160
Well maybe then you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,340
What about you?

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,440
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet

120
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,760
to be jogged in.

121
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,720
Well I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

122
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Alright, we're back.

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,280
So now let's take a look at these three phrases on Fluency Builder.

125
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,680
Okay, this first phrase is very common at gas stations and fast food chains.

127
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,600
We say on the go.

128
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,040
Alright, so he mentioned that we are a society that is always on the go.

129
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,840
It means we're always moving.

130
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,240
Exactly, so you're always going to work, going home from work, going to the store, going

131
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,120
to the school to get the kids.

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Always moving, moving, moving.

133
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,120
So that kind of action, that kind of life is on the go.

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,560
You can also say eat on the go.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,320
That means I eat while I'm going somewhere, while I'm doing something.

136
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,720
I don't sit down.

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, so on the go.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,760
And well, talking about New Year's resolution and we said that well many people resolve

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,620
to do something but they don't really do it.

140
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,300
And we have a phrase that is used here, to stick to something.

141
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Stick to your resolution.

142
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
To stick to it.

143
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,000
So you think of tape or glue, these things that help things stick together.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Okay, so in that sense it's kind of a way for you to describe continuing to do something

145
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,400
or not stopping, not quitting, not ending it.

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,240
And so I could say, remember how I said I wanted to quit smoking?

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,480
Well I'm really going to stick to this resolution because I think it's important.

148
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,760
That means I'm not going to give up.

149
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Right, very good.

150
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
So you're going to stay with it.

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
You're not going to give up.

152
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Alright, so stick to something like for example our English learners, they'll stick to learning

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,660
English.

154
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,920
And we could say as words of encouragement, hey stick to it.

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Stick to it.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't give up.

157
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Keep with it.

158
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Don't give up.

159
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,840
And well finally they were discussing, more arguing about the gym membership and everything

160
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,240
and he mentioned that the gym bag is gathering dust.

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,760
Alright, this is a very nice phrase I think because it's very visual.

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,280
I like phrases where you can see what's happening.

163
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,160
So gathering means collecting.

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,280
That means that the dust in the air, it's building on this bag.

165
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,480
And something is gathering dust if we don't use it.

166
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,600
So we haven't gone to the gym because our bag is in the corner and it's just filled

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
with dust.

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Exactly.

169
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,360
We could also say this about the computer.

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
Why should I buy you a new computer Marco if you never use the old one?

171
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,940
That's just sitting in the house gathering dust.

172
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
Very good.

173
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,280
Okay, so it's another way of saying you never use it, you never do it, etc.

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,540
It's for an object though.

175
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,840
You can't say you are gathering dust.

176
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
No, well that would be a little weird.

177
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,040
You might be dead or something.

178
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,520
Alright, great phrases.

179
00:08:49,520 --> 00:09:01,760
So why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time.

180
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
Did you read this?

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,520
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends

182
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
and family.

183
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,000
Why would that be funny?

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well think about it.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We are a society that is always on the go.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Not because we have to, but because we want to.

187
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Why?

188
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,000
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,320
goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

190
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution

191
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
yourself.

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
What's the point?

193
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,040
We always make New Year's resolutions, and by February we will have forgotten about them.

194
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
It's pointless.

195
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Well maybe then you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.

196
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,020
What about you?

197
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,120
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet

198
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
to be jogged in.

199
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Well I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

200
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,240
Alright, we're back.

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:06,120
And well, as you mentioned, there are some interesting things about this dialogue, especially

203
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,400
when they talked about a society that is always on the go.

204
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,720
And you mentioned that well, sometimes you eat on the go.

205
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
And I've seen people in the United States that are actually eating while driving.

206
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm guilty of doing that.

207
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,080
Yeah, you have no time to actually sit down for like 15 minutes and eat.

208
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,920
No, I remember being in high school at home and you just have so much stuff to do.

209
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,640
You have school, then after school there's like soccer practice, after that there's music

210
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,760
lessons and you never have time to eat so you have to grab food in the car and then

211
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,480
on the way home you're picking things up and you get home and you do your homework or whatever.

212
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
There's so much stuff to do and it doesn't stop.

213
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
It doesn't stop when you grow up.

214
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,720
It doesn't stop if you're an older person.

215
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,080
That's the way life is in America.

216
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Wow, yeah, that's really interesting because I think many of our listeners that are in

217
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,600
other countries would find that a little bit peculiar if they actually went to the United

218
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,120
States and saw somebody in their car, you know, like having a hamburger while driving,

219
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,400
you know, and sipping on their soda.

220
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Yeah, it's kind of sad.

221
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Well, that's the thing.

222
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
You don't have much time.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,440
But actually, this is based on true events, kind of, on the fact that many Americans do

224
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,680
want to spend more time at home with their friends, with their family because, as you

225
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,720
say, you're always so busy.

226
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,800
And I think it's a nice resolution to resolve to have dinner with your family once or twice

227
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,120
a week at home where you sit down and you talk about your lives.

228
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,920
It's nice because you get to share and you get to know each other better and, you know,

229
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,520
otherwise you're always just on the go in different places.

230
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
Yeah, exactly.

231
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,480
