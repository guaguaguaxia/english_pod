00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,640
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about something that is, well, not so fun

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
when it happens.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
That's right.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,680
Today we're going to talk about those situations where people are trying to take advantage

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
of us.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
All right.

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,720
They're lying to us so they can take our money.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,940
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue and when we come back in a moment, we'll be talking

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:32,320
about some of these words and phrases that you're about to hear.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,040
I got an urgent email from Tom.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,000
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,960
That sounds really dodgy to me.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,960
No way.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Tom is an honest person.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
He wouldn't lie to me.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,360
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,640
I mean, think about it.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,720
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,160
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
For sure.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
There's so many con artists out there.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,080
You never really know.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,920
All right, we're back.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,640
So let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,240
In Language Takeaway, Marco, one of the first things we hear is that I got an urgent email

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
from Tom.

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
That's right.

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,820
So this is an adjective, something that is urgent.

32
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,820
It's urgent.

33
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,240
It means it needs to be looked at immediately.

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
It's very important.

35
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
That's right.

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,080
So you can have an urgent email.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,640
That means it's a very important email or something in a situation can be urgent.

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Yeah, like an emergency.

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,280
So urgent care.

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,640
We talk about at the hospital.

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,960
It's something that needs to be looked at by a doctor immediately, urgently.

42
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
That's right.

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Urgently.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
That would be the adverb.

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,800
So we go on to say that the email is urgent because it's from Tom and the email said that

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,360
he is in London and he got robbed.

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,640
All right, he got robbed.

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
All right.

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,200
So to rob is the verb, R-O-B, but here it's important to look at the verb got.

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,960
This means that whatever's happening, it happened to him, to the friend by someone else.

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
That's right.

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,600
So someone robbed him.

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
All right, he got robbed.

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,480
That means someone took his money, right?

55
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
That's right.

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,600
So the verb would be to get and robbed would be an adjective ending ed, but we also have

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,800
the verb to rob and if you rob someone, that means that you are stealing his or her money.

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Yeah, if I rob Marco, it means I take Marco's money from him, but if I got robbed by Marco,

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,920
it means he took my money.

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
That's right.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,920
So if you use the verb to rob by itself, that means that you are doing the action or someone

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,400
is stealing from another person, but if you get robbed or a person got robbed, that means

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,800
he or her got money taken from him.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Now the friend got robbed, someone took his money and we've been asked to wire him some

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
money.

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Okay, to wire money.

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,840
That's right, to wire money.

68
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,640
This basically means to send money.

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,760
It's a very old way or form of sending money.

70
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,960
Basically you're sending money electronically.

71
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,440
You don't actually buy an envelope and put some money in it and send it in the mail.

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,560
You go to a bank or Western Union and you transfer the money electronically.

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
That's right.

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,120
So to send an electronic transfer of money, we usually say you wire someone some money.

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,160
Yeah, I'll wire it to you.

76
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
That's right.

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
All right.

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,520
So the main topic about today's lesson is about people trying to scam other people.

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,520
All right, here the verb to scam means to lie or to be dishonest with someone so that

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,120
you can take their money or to take advantage of them.

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
That's right.

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,960
So to scam means to take advantage of someone, to lie to someone, but you also have a scam,

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,820
a noun, which is a situation where people are trying to take your money.

84
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,800
So a very famous scam might be people in a big city like Paris saying, Oh, I'm a tourist.

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm lost.

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Can you help me?

87
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Can you give me some money to go to the train station?

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,720
And really these people, they're not lost.

89
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,640
They just want you to give them money.

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
That's right.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
This is called a scam.

92
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,960
And what they're doing is they are trying to scam you.

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
That's right.

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,040
And so we actually have a word for these type of people.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,760
We say they are con artists.

96
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,640
They are conning you.

97
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
A con artist.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Okay.

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,840
So we know what an artist is.

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,400
An artist is a person who maybe paints pictures or makes something creative.

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,800
But a con is someone who breaks the law.

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,200
So a con artist is someone who creatively breaks the law.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
That's right.

104
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,300
So these are basically thieves or people who take advantage of other people or steal from

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,860
other people in a very creative way.

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,300
So there are situations where they may sell something that doesn't even really belong

107
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
to them.

108
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
That's right.

109
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,480
So the thing to remember here with a con artist is that there's almost always a story.

110
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,720
You know, you have to, they give you this story and they make you believe them and then

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,320
you give them money or you give them some help that they don't deserve and that way

112
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,840
they take it away from you.

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
That's right.

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
All right.

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,980
So we've taken a look at a lot of language here.

116
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:38,240
Let's take a break, listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,960
I got an urgent email from Tom.

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,040
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
What?

120
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,880
That sounds really dodgy to me.

121
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
No way.

122
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Tom is an honest person.

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
He wouldn't lie to me.

124
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,280
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

125
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,560
I mean, think about it.

126
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

127
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,080
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

128
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
For sure.

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,520
There's so many con artists out there.

130
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
You never really know.

131
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
All right, we're back.

132
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Fluency Builder.

134
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,280
So we've got two friends who are talking.

135
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,680
One friend says that they got an urgent email from Tom and the other says, wow, that sounds

136
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,840
really dodgy to me.

137
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Just right.

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,840
So if something sounds dodgy or something is dodgy, it means it doesn't really sound

139
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
believable or correct or legal.

140
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
That's right.

141
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,800
So maybe I can't trust it.

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,560
Something is dodgy if it doesn't sound like something I would want to trust.

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,320
And I think you can say it about a situation.

144
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,280
So this robbery, it sounds quite dodgy.

145
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,920
You can also say it about food, right?

146
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Right.

147
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,600
So if something looks kind of dodgy, it means it doesn't really look safe.

148
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah.

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
Maybe I'll be sick if I eat it.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,760
So it's quite dodgy looking.

151
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Right.

152
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Or even a person can look dodgy.

153
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,160
So maybe that person is not really someone you want to trust.

154
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,800
A con artist doesn't always look dodgy.

155
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,880
But if a person looks dodgy and they ask you for money, probably shouldn't give it that

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
many money.

157
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Right.

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Exactly.

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
All right.

160
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
So that's dodgy.

161
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,960
Now, the person answers by saying, no way.

162
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,160
Tom is an honest person.

163
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
He wouldn't lie to me.

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
He's not dodgy.

165
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
He's not.

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
No way.

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Right.

168
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Now, this is a really popular thing to say.

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,520
And it means basically, that's not possible.

170
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I don't agree with you.

171
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
I disagree.

172
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,040
And it's pretty forceful, actually.

173
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
You're expressing your opinion.

174
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,440
So if I say, the Chicago White Sox are the best baseball team in the world.

175
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
No way.

176
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
No, you're wrong.

177
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,600
I think the Yankees are the best.

178
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,680
We could go back and forth.

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
No way.

180
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Right, exactly.

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,040
But basically, you're disagreeing.

182
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
That's right.

183
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,360
Now, the situation evolves around the fact that someone may have hacked Tom's email account

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
and send out that email.

185
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
All right.

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,600
So the phrase here would be to hack an account or to hack a website.

187
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,120
It's important to remember that the verb to hack is pretty recent.

188
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,440
We talk mostly about computers and the internet when we talk about hacking.

189
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Right.

190
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,000
And it means to gain access, all right, to go into somebody's account without permission.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Right.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,400
It can be illegally or, like you said, without permission.

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,200
So if your email account gets hacked, it means someone else accessed it without your permission

194
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
or illegally.

195
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,000
So when someone has access to your account, they hack it.

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Usually they send out an email with your name.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,320
So your friends think it's you, but really it's someone who is maybe a con artist or

198
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,920
someone who's not trustworthy.

199
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
That's right.

200
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
That's exactly right.

201
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,880
So that's the word to hack or maybe the noun, the person that hacks is called a hacker.

202
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
Now moving on to our last phrase.

203
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,280
When we agree with someone forcefully, like we said, no way was to disagree.

204
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,520
When we do agree, we say for sure.

205
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
That's right.

206
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
This is basically the opposite.

207
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,720
In this situation, we were thinking, well, do you really think someone is trying to hack

208
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,400
his account?

209
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
The answer was for sure.

210
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,800
That means definitely, absolutely.

211
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
That's right.

212
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
For sure.

213
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,560
It's another way of agreeing, strongly agreeing with someone or with what someone said.

214
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
For sure.

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
For sure.

216
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
All right.

217
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
So that's all we have for today.

218
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,920
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

219
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,600
I got an urgent email from Tom.

220
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

221
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
What?

222
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,520
That sounds really dodgy to me.

223
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
No way.

224
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Tom is an honest person.

225
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
He wouldn't lie to me.

226
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,920
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

227
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,200
I mean, think about it.

228
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,280
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

229
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,680
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

230
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
For sure.

231
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,120
There's so many con artists out there.

232
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,960
You never really know.

233
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
All right, we're back.

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,560
So talking about scams and con artists in China, there is actually a very, very, very

235
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,480
famous scam involving tea.

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
That's right.

237
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,280
And this is something that you might experience in Beijing or Shanghai or any big city.

238
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,840
I hope you don't.

239
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,880
But basically, as a tourist, you're traveling around, you go to a major tourist site like

240
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,920
Tiananmen or the People's Square in Shanghai and some other tourists, some Chinese tourists,

241
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,960
they come to you and they say, hello, where are you from?

242
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,120
Are you traveling here?

243
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,800
We're traveling too.

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,200
And then after about half an hour, maybe one hour of talking, they say, hey, we were thinking

245
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
about going to have some tea.

246
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
There's a tea festival.

247
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,120
Would you like to come with us?

248
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Right.

249
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,440
And you go and you drink some tea and you chat and you think, wow, I've made some nice

250
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
new friends.

251
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
These people are very nice.

252
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,760
And then you get the bill.

253
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Right.

254
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,400
And it's like 200 US dollars, which is pretty crazy for tea.

255
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
So exactly.

256
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
It's a scam.

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
These people are con artists.

258
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
They build trust.

259
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
They make you trust them.

260
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,060
They make you think, wow, I have nice new friends.

261
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,940
And then they steal your money.

262
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,940
They steal your money.

263
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
That's right.

264
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,360
It's a very popular scam in China.

265
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,520
And basically, if you do come here, just be aware of it.

266
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,400
It's usually young people.

267
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,640
They say they're university students or they say they are from another city.

268
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
And like you say, they build trust.

269
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,080
They invite you to have tea.

270
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
And you think, well, why not?

271
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,880
You know, to learn more about the culture, to learn more about the country you're visiting.

272
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
And they turn out to try to scam you.

273
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
That's right.

274
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,920
And the most popular one is the artists.

275
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,160
I'm a local artist.

276
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,440
I would like to show you my newest work.

277
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,720
And then they take you and the work is very expensive and they make you buy it.

278
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,520
So just be aware.

279
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:10,200
I think what you said is true, Marco, that you just have to be careful and have to recognize

280
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,120
that not everyone wants to be your friend.

281
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Exactly.

282
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Yeah.

283
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
So be careful when you're traveling.

284
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,000
And I'm sure it happens in many other countries.

285
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Maybe you have some stories that you've experienced or maybe some local types of scams that you

286
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,760
may know about in your country.

287
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
That's right.

288
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
