00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello English learners, welcome back. We are here at EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
And I'm Erika.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,880
And today we're going to be bringing you a lesson about eggs.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,640
That's right. And who knew there was so much to talk about when we're talking eggs.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,560
Right. Well, we always have eggs for breakfast and there are many ways of preparing them,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,560
so we're going to learn what the different ways are.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,720
Yes, and we'll learn some of the language that goes along with eggs.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,440
Okay. So we have three words that we want to take a look at before we listen to our

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,960
dialogue. So let's look at these in Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,360
Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Our preview word for this lesson is picky.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Picky.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Picky.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
Picky.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
So picky is an interesting adjective.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
Okay. So if a person is picky, what does that mean?

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
They're very hard to please.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,760
Okay. So if your boss is picky and you give him a report and maybe it has, I don't know,

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,320
a couple of mistakes or something.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,880
Yeah, he'll say, do it again. Change this, this and this.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Okay.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,120
So if you are picky, you want everything to be perfect.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,840
And if there's one small thing that's not, you won't be happy.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,200
Okay. So picky, interesting word. Now our next word, yolk.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Yolk.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Yolk.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Yolk.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Yolk.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Yolk.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,480
So this word is actually not in the dialogue.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,560
It's not in the dialogue, but it's important that you know, right?

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,160
Okay. So if you have an egg, the yellow part is called the yolk.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,120
Okay. And what about the other part?

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
The white.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
The white.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
The white.

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Or also called the egg white, right?

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Yes. Egg white.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,360
Okay. So pretty simple. Yolk and egg white.

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,760
Let's listen to our dialogue. We are going to be listening to a couple who are having

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
breakfast.

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:07,720
Wow. You're up early today. What's for breakfast?

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,880
Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,920
Smells good. I'll make some coffee. Do you want me to make you some eggs?

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,240
I'll take mine sunny side up.

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that. Ever since I was small, I've had eggs

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
and soldiers.

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years. It drove my mom crazy.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,800
You know what really drives me crazy? When I ask for soft boiled eggs and they overcook

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,760
them so they come out hard boiled. How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:51,320
You're so picky sometimes.

52
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Here you go, honey. Fried eggs.

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:06,240
Damn it. I said sunny side up. How many times do I have to tell you?

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,840
So she is definitely very picky and has a very bad temper.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,120
I know. I can't believe anyone would get so angry over their breakfast. But I guess it

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,600
is the most important meal of the day.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,280
Exactly. So we heard a couple of different ways of describing how you prepare eggs, so

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,800
let's take a look at that in Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Language Takeaway.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,560
Okay, so our first preparation method, my favorite, sunny side up.

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,920
Okay, sunny side up.

62
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Sunny side up.

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
Now, this is interesting. Sunny, like the sun, right?

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Exactly.

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,240
So when you fry an egg, right, and the yolk looks like a little sun, right?

66
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Yeah, exactly.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,480
So why is it called sunny side up?

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,380
I think because of what you just said. It looks like the sun.

69
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,680
But you don't cook the yolk, right?

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Yeah, the yolk is still yellow. It's still a little bit liquid. It's a little bit soft.

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,080
Okay, because the opposite would be a fried egg.

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes.

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,600
And that's our second word.

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Fried egg.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Fried egg.

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
So this, you put the egg in the pan and you cook it all the way through.

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,360
All the way through. So the yolk is not liquid anymore. It becomes hardened.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Yes.

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Right?

80
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Exactly.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay.

82
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
A fried egg.

83
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Let's take a look at our next set of eggs.

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
All right.

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
A soft boiled egg.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
A soft boiled egg.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Soft boiled.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
Soft boiled.

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Okay, so to boil, you put the egg?

90
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,440
In water.

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,560
In boiling water.

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,040
Yes, and make it cook.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,280
And make it cook. So how long would you usually put it in for to be soft boiled?

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,080
Three minutes, four minutes.

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,400
Three minutes, okay. So you only cook part of the egg, right?

96
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,000
The yolk, the yellow part, stays a little bit wet, a little bit liquid.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay. So again, the opposite would be?

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,280
A hard boiled egg.

99
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Hard boiled egg.

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Hard boiled.

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,960
So hard boiled is when you cook the entire egg again.

102
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,120
Yes, so then it's hard like a ball.

103
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,360
The entire egg. So with this soft boiled and hard boiled eggs, this takes us to our next

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,880
form, eggs and soldiers.

105
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,720
Eggs and soldiers.

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Eggs and soldiers.

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Eggs and soldiers.

108
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,440
Now this is really interesting. I didn't really know about this before. It kind of sounds

109
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,400
like you're having eggs with a group of soldiers from the army.

110
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,320
Well, this is a very British way of eating eggs. So you have your soft boiled egg in

111
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,840
a cup and you have a piece of toast. But the toast is cut into long pieces.

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,360
And then you take those pieces and you dip them into the egg yolk. It's delicious.

113
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
It's good.

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,920
Yeah. Typical English way of eating eggs.

115
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay. So eggs and soldiers. Interesting. And this takes us to our last form of egg preparation

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
and probably the most popular.

117
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,920
Yes. Scrambled eggs.

118
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Scrambled eggs.

119
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Scrambled eggs.

120
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Take eggs, put them in a pan and then you just move them all over the place.

121
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Mix them all up.

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Mix them all up.

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,760
So the yolk and the white are mixed together.

124
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:21,200
All right. So we've looked at a lot of egg preparation and now we can listen to our dialogue

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,600
for the second time and then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Wow. You're up early today. What's for breakfast?

127
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,320
Well, I felt like baking so I made some muffins.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,960
Smells good. I'll make some coffee. Do you want me to make you some eggs?

129
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,920
Sure. I'll take mine sunny side up.

130
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Ew. I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that. Ever since I was small, I've had

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
eggs and soldiers.

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,680
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years. It drove my mom crazy.

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,200
You know what really drives me crazy? When I asked for soft boiled eggs and they overcook

134
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,800
them so they come out hard boiled. How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,680
You're so picky sometimes.

136
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,240
Here you go, honey. Fried eggs.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:39,160
Damn it. I said sunny side up. How many times do I have to tell you?

138
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,680
Interesting that the man in this dialogue is the one doing the baking.

139
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,960
Yeah. Well, that's modern days. I don't know. Men are learning how to cook and yeah.

140
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
House husband.

141
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,280
House husband. Yeah. More popular these days.

142
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,520
All right. Well, since this house husband felt like baking, I think we should look at

143
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,880
this and one other phrase in Fluency Builder.

144
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,360
Okay. So great phrase. He said, I felt like baking.

145
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
I felt like baking.

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,040
I felt like baking. So let's take a look at this. He feels like or he felt like in the

147
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,600
past. What does that mean when you feel like?

148
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,640
You want to do it. You have the desire to do it.

149
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,280
Okay. And then to bake. And now this verb is in the gerund form.

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
That's right. The ing form.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
And that's the rule, right? I feel like playing soccer.

152
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,960
Right. I feel like eating lunch.

153
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,640
I felt like going to the movies. That's the way you would say this. You have the desire.

154
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,320
You feel like doing something.

155
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Exactly.

156
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,480
Okay. Very good. And now let's take a look at this second phrase. Drives me crazy.

157
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,160
Drives me crazy.

158
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Drives me crazy.

159
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,800
All right. This is a very, very descriptive phrase. And I think if we listen to some examples,

160
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
it will help us understand the meaning.

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:07,040
Example one. This music is driving me crazy. Turn it down.

162
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:17,320
Example two. Don't leave garbage in my car. It drives me crazy.

163
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:26,200
Example three. Your mom is driving me crazy. She keeps calling me.

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,120
All right. So if something drives you crazy.

165
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,040
It makes you feel very angry or annoyed.

166
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Irritated.

167
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Yeah. Frustrated.

168
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,440
Okay. But it can also be positive, right? Like that girl drives me crazy.

169
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,240
As in you really, really, really like her.

170
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Yeah.

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,440
I don't know. It sounds a little bit inappropriate to me.

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Really?

173
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Yeah.

174
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,080
I think it's okay. It drives me crazy. Like she's got me thinking and she's got me in

175
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
the clouds or something like that.

176
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,200
All right. Well, maybe there's something about you that I don't need to know. So I'll just

177
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
let you keep that thought to yourself.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,680
All right. Well, I'm just saying we could use it in a positive form as well.

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,280
Okay. You're just saying.

180
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm just saying. All right. So drives me crazy. Really great phrase. And you can use it in

181
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,200
all of these different situations like we heard. So let's listen to our dialogue for

182
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:24,680
the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

183
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,880
Wow. You're up early today. What's for breakfast?

184
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,040
Well, I felt like baking so I made some muffins.

185
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,120
Smells good. I'll make some coffee. Do you want me to make you some eggs?

186
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,440
Sure. I'll take mine sunny side up.

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,160
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that. Ever since I was small, I've had eggs

188
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
and soldiers.

189
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,200
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years. It drove my mom crazy.

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,960
You know what really drives me crazy? When I ask for soft boiled eggs and they overcook

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,960
them so they come out hard boiled. How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:15,960
You're so picky sometimes. Here you go, honey. Fried eggs.

193
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,480
Damn it. I said sunny side up. How many times do I have to tell you?

194
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,440
Well, I think there are some people who really, really love eating eggs for breakfast and

195
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
some people who just can't stand it.

196
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah. I don't know who though. I mean, who doesn't like eggs in the morning?

197
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
I know. I'm a big fan.

198
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,000
Right? Eggs, bacon, toast. Good stuff.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,760
Traditional American type breakfast.

200
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,000
Now you were telling me that you have some traditions when you eat eggs.

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,760
I know. I think, I'm not sure if this is just in my family, but I think actually it might

202
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:58,240
be common with other people as well. When you eat a soft boiled or hard boiled egg,

203
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,640
you have to eat all of the egg outside of the shell and then you have to break the bottom

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,440
of the shell after you finished.

205
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Why?

206
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,080
So that the fairies who live in your egg cup can come out.

207
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
So it's kind of like a superstition.

208
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Yeah, I guess it is.

209
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Interesting.

210
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,280
Yeah. So I don't know. You guys, do you have any egg traditions or any other crazy food

211
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
stories like that?

212
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,800
Well, for example, I was telling you that when I prepare scrambled eggs, sometimes I

213
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,640
like to take some rice, some rice that has already been cooked, put it in the pan and

214
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,200
then take some eggs, two eggs, put it on top of the rice and scramble the rice with the

215
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
eggs.

216
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Okay. For breakfast?

217
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
Yeah, it could be for breakfast.

218
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Really?

219
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Yeah. A little bit. Not like a huge plate of rice or maybe at night you don't have anything

220
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
to eat.

221
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Okay.

222
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,800
Scrambled eggs with rice. It's a poor man's food.

223
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,560
All right. Well, it's also a quick man's food.

224
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,960
Yeah, exactly. So let us know if you guys have any egg preparations or any special egg

225
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,400
recipes or traditions that you practice.
