00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,040
My name is Catherine and today Marco and I have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,040
That's right.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,780
It's a new year and so we have a lesson for you where we are going to make new decisions

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,220
and have a new opportunity in the new year, right?

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,220
That's right.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,500
So the new year is the time to change parts of your life maybe.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,460
So that's what we're going to talk about today.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,240
Let's listen to this dialogue three times and when we come back we'll be talking about

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:41,520
the words and phrases in the dialogue.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Yeah?

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,700
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,700
You got it.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,900
I have a new job.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,280
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,600
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,860
So what are you going to do?

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,220
Take up an art class or something?

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,740
Well first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.

22
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,140
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,400
It's just that I've been smoking since I was 16 and I think it's time to stop.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,340
I'm with you on that one.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,180
Anything else you're planning on doing?

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,180
One last thing.

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,380
I've decided to come out of the closet.

28
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,620
It's about time.

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,820
Alright we're back and so if you notice the dialogue has actually a lot of really really

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,780
rich phrases in there.

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,680
So today we're going to change the format a little bit and we're going to do Fluency

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,140
Builder in two different sections.

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,840
So starting out with the first one on Fluency Builder part one.

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,960
Fluency Builder.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,200
So the new year we think about new things, changing things.

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,740
We have a great phrase in English to describe starting fresh, starting anew.

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,660
And we say turn over a new leaf.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,140
Okay so you turn over a new leaf.

39
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,700
So that means that you are going to maybe make a radical change, right?

40
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Completely new.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
That's right.

42
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,900
So if you think about it, it's a new chapter in your life or a new adventure or something

43
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,900
like that.

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,600
Maybe you're going to quit your job.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,660
Turn over a new leaf.

46
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
Start a new job.

47
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,660
Okay.

48
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,500
So you can say I'm going to turn over a new leaf or Sarah turned over a new leaf and quit

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
smoking.

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,940
Let's turn over a new leaf and forget the past.

51
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
There we go.

52
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,860
Alright so to turn over a new leaf.

53
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,380
So just imagine that you have a leaf on the ground and you turn it over and it's nice

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,380
and clean.

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
Alright.

56
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,500
And talking about cleanliness, our second phrase is to wipe the slate clean.

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,300
Okay when I think about this phrase, I think about a chalkboard.

58
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,820
So a slate is like a chalkboard and all of the things that you've done, good and bad,

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,640
are on that chalkboard.

60
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,900
And to wipe the slate clean means to erase those words, erase those things.

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,380
So perhaps Marco and I fight all the time and we're angry at each other.

62
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,900
Finally I say listen, Marco, let's wipe the slate clean.

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,260
Let's forget the past.

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,300
Let's forget the things we said and start again.

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,780
Start a new leaf.

66
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,340
To wipe the slate clean is to just start over.

67
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,140
You know just to erase everything, let's forget about it and start over.

68
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,140
Exactly.

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,660
Alright and so we're starting over and his friend is asking you decided to wipe the slate

70
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,420
clean and the friend said you got it.

71
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
You got what?

72
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
What?

73
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
It.

74
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,420
What is it?

75
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,540
In English we love the word it.

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,260
Well in this case you got it means you're right exactly.

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,540
You understand what I'm talking about.

78
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
Okay.

79
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,020
So if you agree with me or I understand what you're talking about you would say you got

80
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
it.

81
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
You got it.

82
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
You got it.

83
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,540
Alright so I'm trying to explain to you maybe Marco something very difficult like if you

84
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,780
add four and ten you get fourteen but what if you add ten more?

85
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
It's twenty four.

86
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
You got it.

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
Alright.

88
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Okay so he understands math.

89
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Yes.

90
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,420
Okay so that's the way you would use you got it.

91
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,020
It's a really popular phrase.

92
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,380
I mean you can use it on pretty much anything not only if you're right but also if somebody

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,780
agrees with it or you promise something right.

94
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,420
So are you going to pick me up today?

95
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,420
Yeah you got it.

96
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Okay.

97
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
No problem.

98
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,700
So it's a way to agree or to show that you're saying yes.

99
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Yes.

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,160
Okay so why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll come back shortly to look

101
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:39,900
at Fluency Builder part two.

102
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Now that it's the new year I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

103
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Yeah?

104
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,100
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?

105
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
You got it.

106
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,300
I have a new job.

107
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,660
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

108
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,980
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

109
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,220
So what are you going to do?

110
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,580
Take up an art class or something?

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,540
Well first of all I've decided to stop smoking.

112
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,140
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything it's just that I've been smoking since I was

113
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,780
sixteen and I think it's time to stop.

114
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm with you on that one.

115
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,540
Anything else you're planning on doing?

116
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,540
One last thing.

117
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,740
I've decided to come out of the closet.

118
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,380
It's about time.

119
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,900
Alright we're back so now let's continue with our Fluency Builder.

120
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,220
And well they kept talking and the guy mentioned that he's going to stop smoking.

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,700
But it's not because he is pinching pennies.

122
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,420
Oh pinching.

123
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,420
That sounds painful.

124
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Right.

125
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,220
Okay pinching is something you do especially when you're a child.

126
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,540
You squeeze the skin.

127
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,860
Pinch and it hurts.

128
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,900
So to pinch really is to hold something with two fingers.

129
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,780
To pinch pennies means to try to spend very very very little money.

130
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,660
So if we say if I say hey Marco you want to go to dinner tonight?

131
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,180
There's this really nice Italian place.

132
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,820
It's a little expensive but.

133
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh I can't I'm sorry.

134
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,140
I'm really pinching pennies these days because I'm kind of broke.

135
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,340
So maybe we'll go somewhere cheaper.

136
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,220
So actually pennies are one cent coins.

137
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,420
They're called pennies in the United States.

138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,420
That's right and it's the smallest kind of money that we have in America.

139
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,020
So if you're pinching pennies, if you're saving pennies, it means you really don't have much

140
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
money.

141
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
You're really really saving.

142
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
That's right.

143
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,780
Okay so pinching pennies.

144
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,100
So he decided to quit smoking and his friend agreed with him and said you know what I'm

145
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,860
with you on that one.

146
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,300
Okay so you quit smoking Marco and I quit smoking.

147
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm with you on that one.

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,020
I think it's a good idea.

149
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,180
If I'm with you on that one it means I agree with you.

150
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,700
You're doing the right thing.

151
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,700
So you can say I'm with you on that one or you can just say you know what I'm with you.

152
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Do it.

153
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm with you.

154
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
I agree.

155
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm with you.

156
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
I support your decision.

157
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,540
So you are going to go skydiving in a couple weeks.

158
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,980
That means you're going to jump out of an airplane.

159
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,780
I'm not with you on that one.

160
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,580
You don't support my decision.

161
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,420
I think it's okay for you but I would not want to do it.

162
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Alright.

163
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,860
Right so you can do it in that way or just anything.

164
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,180
You support somebody's decision.

165
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm with you.

166
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
I'm with you on that one.

167
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
Exactly.

168
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,300
Alright and our last phrase.

169
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,040
To come out of the closet.

170
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,380
So who's in the closet?

171
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,540
Why is somebody hiding in the closet?

172
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,460
Okay someone's not really hiding in the closet.

173
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,460
This is a phrase we use to describe someone who is gay or lesbian who has a secret about

174
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,180
being a gay or lesbian.

175
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,620
So when they come out of the closet, they're telling their friends and family for the first

176
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,980
time that this is how they feel.

177
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,580
So it's basically a phrase that's kind of a metaphor to say you know what I'm going

178
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,380
to tell everyone that I am gay or lesbian.

179
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
That's right.

180
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,700
Well it's because in English often times a closet is a place where we keep secrets.

181
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,300
So to come out of the closet means to share your secrets with people.

182
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,860
So sometimes in English you say you have skeletons in the closet.

183
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
That's right.

184
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
This is a little different.

185
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,220
Maybe I killed someone and it's a skeleton in my closet.

186
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,740
It's a secret that I keep.

187
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,900
But a skeleton in your closet can also be a very big secret like you were once married

188
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,740
and you never told anyone.

189
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,660
Yeah or I have two kids and I never told you guys.

190
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Right.

191
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,900
So those are the skeletons in the closet but in this case it's to come out of the closet

192
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,180
and that's always related to telling somebody for the first time that you are gay or lesbian.

193
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,460
That's right and we don't say it about being straight which is the opposite which is men

194
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,780
who love women and women who love men.

195
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,700
You don't say it about coming out of the closet there.

196
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,660
You say it about being gay or lesbian.

197
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
Okay.

198
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,260
So very interesting and so I think we should listen to this dialogue for the last time

199
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:04,140
and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

200
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,220
Now that it's the new year I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

201
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,260
Yeah.

202
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,340
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean.

203
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
You got it.

204
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,540
I have a new job.

205
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,900
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

206
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,220
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

207
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,460
So what are you going to do?

208
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,820
Take up an art class or something?

209
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,300
Well first of all I've decided to stop smoking.

210
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,780
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything.

211
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,020
It's just that I've been smoking since I was 16 and I think it's time to stop.

212
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,980
I'm with you on that one.

213
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,820
Anything else you're planning on doing?

214
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
One last thing.

215
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,020
I've decided to come out of the closet.

216
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,020
It's about time.

217
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,660
All right we're back.

218
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,380
So this is very interesting and these phrases are so common because if you have a fight

219
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,940
with somebody you say, you know what, let's just wipe the slate clean and start all over

220
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,060
again or let's turn over a new leaf.

221
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,820
Let's stop fighting.

222
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,980
And especially in New Year's, right, everyone makes a promise to start fresh.

223
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
That's right.

224
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,200
Well the new year you can use a new calendar.

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,540
You can take a fresh perspective on your life.

226
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,140
It's refreshing and I think it's good that we do this.

227
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,140
We evaluate the things that make us happy and we evaluate the things that make us unhappy

228
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,380
and part of that means turning over a new leaf.

229
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,820
Part of it also means apologizing to people or trying to make the relationships in your

230
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,700
life healthier.

231
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,300
And I think it's very healthy that the person in this dialogue says, listen, I'm finally

232
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,580
going to come out of the closet.

233
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,940
I'm going to be honest with my friends and family.

234
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,620
And that's really interesting because as we said, to come out of the closet is a phrase

235
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,540
used in English and mostly related only in this context so you might see it in TV shows

236
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,660
or in a movie.

237
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,380
But it's an interesting topic, still debatable all over the world about gay marriages and

238
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,380
things like that.

239
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,380
That's right.

240
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,340
So we're curious about your New Year's resolutions.

241
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,740
Are you going to be wiping any slates clean?

242
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,340
Are you going to be doing anything differently this year?

243
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,940
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

244
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,500
We look forward to hearing from you and until next time.

245
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Bye everyone.

246
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Happy New Year.

247
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Happy New Year.

248
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Happy New Year.

249
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Happy New Year.
