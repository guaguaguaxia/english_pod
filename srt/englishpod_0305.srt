00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
My name is Catherine and today we're going to be talking about a very fun game.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
That's right.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,600
Today we're going bowling, a very popular sport amongst many people and so we're going

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,040
to take a look at how you play this sport and all the vocab related to this great game.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
Alright so let's take a listen to our dialogue and we'll be right back.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,280
Alright, so the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,320
that line where the lane begins.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,360
Why not?

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,560
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,480
If you step there you'll slip and fall.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now how the heck

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,560
do I play this?

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,260
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,420
If you do, that is called a strike.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,880
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,400
After 10 frames we add up the points and see who has the most.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,120
300 is a perfect score but very hard to get.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Got it.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Okay I'm going to give it a go.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,420
I told you, it's harder than you think.

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:23,160
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:32,600
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at some of that vocab on Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
So the first word we have today in Language Takeaway is lane.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,320
That's right, a bowling lane.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,500
So a lane, that is where you actually play this game.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,960
That's right a lane is also a word for like a road, a small narrow road.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,740
So in bowling this is the flat surface, the floor that's long that you roll the ball down.

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,680
That's right, okay so that's your lane.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,040
So as you said you roll the ball down the lane and you try to knock down the pins that

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,720
are at the end of the lane.

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,880
That's right so pins are, they're a little bit heavy, they're usually white and they

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,600
have, they're wide at the bottom and narrow at the top.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,480
They almost look like wine bottles.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,680
And the goal of the game is to knock these down, to make them fall on the ground.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,120
That's right, okay so that's why you are using, that's why you are throwing the ball down

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,460
the lane to knock down these pins.

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,520
Now if you knock all of them down on your first try, that's called a strike.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
A strike, that's right.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,420
So that means all ten pins fall down on your first try.

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,040
But sometimes you don't get a strike, you maybe knock down eight pins and then later

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,440
on your second try, because every person gets two tries, on your second try you knock down

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,960
the last two pins.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,080
Now what's that called Marco?

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,760
So if you knock all of them down on your second try, that's called a spare.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,980
Okay strike, usually you write it with an X, that's on the scorecard and a spare, which

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,560
is two tries to get all ten pins, that's a slash.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
That's right.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
A spare.

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,040
And if you don't get all of the pins in two tries, you still get points.

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,480
So if you knock down eight pins, you get eight.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,680
Or if you knock down four pins, you get four.

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
That's right.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,320
And you put your score on your scorecard and now each player usually gets ten frames or

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,640
ten different opportunities to knock down all the pins.

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,080
Alright so usually these are boxes on the scorecard and you can play ten frame bowling

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,920
or also five frame.

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,720
But it's important to remember that each frame gives you the opportunity to bowl two times.

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Right.

62
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Alright so you get those two tries.

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,120
So really it's twenty total tries to knock down these pins.

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
That's right.

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,120
And now if you did really well and on every opportunity of each frame, you got a strike,

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
that means that you would get a perfect score.

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,040
That's right a perfect score, that means that you made no mistakes, you knocked down all

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,760
the pins on the first try.

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,920
And now obviously down the lane, it's not as easy as it looks because to the sides of

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,160
your bowling lane, you have this kind of a path that's to the bottom.

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
So if your ball goes in there, you can't get it out.

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
That's right.

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,840
So remember like I said earlier, a lane is also the name of a place where we can walk

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
or drive.

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,240
It's like a road.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,400
Well we have gutters which are on the sides of these roads and also in bowling gutters.

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
They're lower and normally on the streets, they're for water but in bowling, they're

78
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,720
the places on the right or the left side where your ball will fall.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,360
And if your ball falls into the gutter or it rolls into the gutter, you will hit no

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
pins.

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Right.

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,660
I think that's the main thing.

83
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,240
If your ball goes in the gutter, you don't hit any pins at all.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,520
It just goes straight down and you don't hit anything.

85
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
That's right.

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,200
So it's really sad when you bowl badly and you get a gutter ball we call it.

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
That's right.

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,400
All right, so let's take a look at all this vocab again.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:22,680
Let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
All right.

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,400
So the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that

92
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
line where the lane begins.

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Why not?

94
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.

95
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
If you step there, you'll slip and fall.

96
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Okay.

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,720
So I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard.

98
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,280
So now how the heck do I play this?

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,000
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
If you do, that is called a strike.

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,640
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,120
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,840
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Got it.

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Okay.

106
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
I'm going to give it a go.

107
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh no.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,360
My ball went in the gutter.

109
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
I told you.

110
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,160
It's harder than you think.

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,040
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
All right.

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
So we've picked out three different phrases for you.

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,240
Let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Fluency Builder.

116
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
All right.

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,560
So the first phrase that we have today is something that you're going to hear a lot,

118
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,080
although I want to remind everyone this is very informal.

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,360
So we heard someone say in the dialogue, so now how the heck do I play this?

120
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Okay.

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,800
So how the heck do I turn this computer on?

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Okay.

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
So how do I turn this computer on means I don't know, please help me.

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,720
But how the heck means I really don't know.

125
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,240
I really need your help.

126
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
That's right.

127
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,920
I really don't understand what's going on.

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,520
I need someone's help.

129
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,760
Like how the heck did this happen means I absolutely did not expect this to happen.

130
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,160
I'm very surprised.

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
That's right.

132
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,880
It's actually a not very polite phrase to use, but at the same time, it's not terribly

133
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
in plight.

134
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
It's in the middle.

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
But it's very informal.

136
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
All right.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,720
So now the person understands how to bowl, how the game works, and he says, okay, got

138
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
it.

139
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm going, I'm gonna give it a go.

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Okay.

141
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm gonna means I'm going to, and this is very informal.

142
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,640
Gonna is a way to say going to, I will.

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
But the phrase here is give it a go.

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,280
What does that mean, Marco?

145
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
Give it a go.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,640
So if you're gonna give it a go, it means that you're going to try.

147
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Okay.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,400
So I'm gonna try.

149
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,840
So we could say this.

150
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,440
Now that we know how to play the game, let's give it a go.

151
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,960
Let's try to play because we've been talking about it, but we haven't been doing it.

152
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
That's right.

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,680
To give it a go means to try to do something.

154
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Exactly.

155
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
And that's basically it.

156
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,640
If maybe you're watching a game on the street and you want to try maybe a card game, you

157
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,320
say, okay, I want to give it a go.

158
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,680
I want to give it a go.

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
All right.

160
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,560
And what about our last phrase?

161
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,760
Now the very last phrase is the last phrase of our dialogue.

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,920
The character says, now let a pro show you how it's done.

163
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
All right.

164
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,280
So how it's done, this let me show you how it's done, because this person is saying,

165
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
I'm a pro.

166
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
Let me show you how it's done.

167
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,440
It's a very interesting way of saying something in English.

168
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,080
What is the real meaning of this phrase?

169
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,520
He's basically saying, now let me show you how to do it.

170
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,200
Okay, the correct way.

171
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Right.

172
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,620
So basically he's saying, you didn't do it very well.

173
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,760
You didn't bowl very well.

174
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,840
You're new.

175
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,240
Let me show you how professional people bowl.

176
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Right.

177
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Let me give you an example.

178
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Exactly.

179
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,400
Maybe you and your friend are making a cake and you don't really know what you're doing.

180
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,380
So your friend says, move over.

181
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,400
Let me show you how it's done.

182
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
That means the proper way to do it, the correct way.

183
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
So Marco, you're not doing it right.

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Let me show you how it's done.

185
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Exactly.

186
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
A very useful phrase.

187
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,920
And actually it can seem a little bit confusing because you're using the verb there, done.

188
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,720
So it may seem a little bit weird, do, done.

189
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
But don't worry about it.

190
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,980
Just take it as a phrase.

191
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,320
Let me show you how to do it.

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,560
Let me show you how it's done.

193
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
That's right.

194
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,640
So that's all we've got for Fluency Builder today.

195
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:27,520
Just take another listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a second.

196
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
All right.

197
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,200
So the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that

198
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
line where the lane begins.

199
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,920
Why not?

200
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,120
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.

201
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,640
If you step there, you'll slip and fall.

202
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Okay.

203
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,540
So I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard.

204
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,100
So now how the heck do I play this?

205
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,820
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

206
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,980
If you do, that is called a strike.

207
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,440
If you don't knock them all down in the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

208
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,920
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

209
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,640
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

210
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Got it.

211
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Okay.

212
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I'm going to give it a go.

213
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh, no.

214
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,640
My ball went in the gutter.

215
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
I told you.

216
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,960
It's harder than you think.

217
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,320
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,680
All right.

219
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
We're back.

220
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,720
So bowling is actually a very, kind of like a pastime in the United States.

221
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,200
You get together with friends and you just go bowling.

222
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
That's right.

223
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
I do believe it's also considered a sport.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,600
So many people play professionally or semi-professionally.

225
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,360
But for me, it's always been a very social game, something you do with a group of friends.

226
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
You go out.

227
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
It's really fun.

228
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Yeah.

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,200
And especially because when you go bowling, many people can play, right?

230
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,400
Not obviously at the same time, but you take turns.

231
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,640
And so while you're waiting, people are talking and eating.

232
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,280
So it is a very social activity.

233
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
That's right.

234
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,120
So maybe a group of people will rent a lane.

235
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,280
Remember, we were talking earlier about a lane being that one kind of strip of wood

236
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,320
where you roll the ball.

237
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,880
Well, a group of friends can rent a lane or two lanes and the four or the eight of you

238
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,440
can play together, each person playing one frame at a time.

239
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
That's right.

240
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,240
And now actually, the other thing about it is it's very funny to see people trying to

241
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,280
bowl or maybe with the heavy ball or maybe they pass the line that we said they shouldn't

242
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,240
pass and they slip and fall.

243
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,720
So I guess that's what also makes it a little bit fun to play.

244
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes, it can be a little bit embarrassing if you're not...

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm not very good, so I'm a very embarrassing bowler.

246
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,760
But it's also really fun because if you go and you just have a nice time, it's a very

247
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
social game.

248
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Well, it is.

249
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,960
And actually, we are really curious to know if you've ever been bowling.

250
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,400
I know many people who've never been bowling and they find it very, very fun.

251
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,680
