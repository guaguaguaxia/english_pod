00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
Hi guys.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Katherine and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson for you about

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,040
some very interesting things.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,040
That's right.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,440
Today we're going to talk about fortune tellers or people that read your future.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,220
Alright so if I want to know who I will marry, if I will be rich, I will go to this fortune

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,100
teller and she or he will tell me what's in my future.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
That's right.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,920
It's very popular in many cultures around the world, many different ways of reading

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,800
your future or telling you your future.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:45,620
So let's jump into this dialogue and see what's going on today.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,360
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,020
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,320
for the next 12 months.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,680
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo do you?

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,560
Well I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,980
of the things the psychic told them came true.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,680
Of course it does.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,200
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,880
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,960
Well historically it's a practice that many cultures share.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,460
Reading the tarot cards.

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,220
In the east they would even read tea leaves.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,960
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
All superstitious nonsense.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,720
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Great.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
I'll make an appointment.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
All right.

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
We're back.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,560
So a lot of interesting things here.

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,360
Let's take a look at some of those words on Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,160
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,040
So in Language Takeaway today we are focusing on some words that describe fortune telling

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,000
but also the different ways of doing so.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,760
The first word we have is actually a name for a person who can read the future.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Right Marco?

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
That's right.

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
A medium.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,320
In the dialogue we hear about a woman who is a medium and is very talented.

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,480
Actually a medium is interesting because a medium is a person who can communicate with

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
the dead.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
That's right.

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,160
Or who can communicate with the other side.

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,960
But if you think about middle, medium, I mean they mean the same thing.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,800
It's someone who is in the middle of two things.

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,960
And so a medium can maybe transmit these different ideas or signals.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Right.

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Right.

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Exactly.

53
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,660
So it's a person that basically communicates as you say with the dead or someone that can

54
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,960
listen to people who are not here anymore.

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,960
But obviously they are a type of person that could also use this gift to tell your future

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,640
or to have the people who are dead tell you what's going to happen in the future.

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
That's right.

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,560
And so another kind of person who would do something similar is a psychic.

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
That's right.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,840
Alright now a psychic is a person who generally will read your future for you, will tell you

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
the future.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,840
Maybe the psychic will have a special tool like a crystal ball.

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,480
Just remember that in English, psych, like psychology, psychosis has to do with your

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
mind.

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Alright.

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,600
So a psychic uses their mind to find out things about you or your future.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
That's right.

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,080
So sometimes psychics will claim that they can read your mind as well.

69
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Right.

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,560
It's a little scary.

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,520
So as you say, these are different, these are people who supposedly can tell you your

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,360
future.

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
And as you said, they use different methods or different tools.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,800
One of them is for example having your palms read.

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,560
Alright, so the psychic will go to you Marco and will look at your hand and will read your

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
palm.

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,160
Now where on your hand is your palm?

78
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,280
It's on the other side, the side where you grab things with.

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
The inside, so the soft part.

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
And maybe on your palm you have many different lines.

81
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,800
So the psychic will look at the lines and will say, oh well this line is very long,

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,840
so you will have a long, long life.

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
That's right.

84
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,680
So maybe in your hands you have lines that determine how much money you will have or

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,120
how many kids you will have or how long you will live.

86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
So that's called a palm reading.

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,160
Or I am going to have my palm read.

88
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
That's right.

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,720
Now the other person doesn't really believe in all that stuff and says that they are just

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
scam artists.

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,560
So he's saying that the psychics or the mediums are just scam artists.

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,200
Alright, so what is a scam artist?

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Well a scam artist is not a real artist.

94
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,840
A scam artist is a thief, someone who will maybe tell you a story or who will lie to

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
you to try and take your money.

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
That's right.

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,960
So he's not really like a robber, like somebody that will break into your house and take your

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
things.

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,400
No, he won't use a gun, maybe, hopefully not, but he will tell you a story or will lie to

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,920
you in a way that makes you want to give him money.

101
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
That's right.

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,480
So I don't know if any of you have ever received an email from someone who said, I am a wealthy

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,960
person from a different part of the world and I want you to give me money to help me

104
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,200
so I can come to America and these kinds of things where you don't know the person, he's

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,960
probably lying to you, it's a very sad story.

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,360
I say please give me money so I can come to visit you or so I can come and have a good

107
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
life.

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
That's a scam artist.

109
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
That's right.

110
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,680
People probably don't have a bad life, they just want you to give them money.

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
That's right.

112
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
That's right.

113
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
So that is a scam artist.

114
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,880
And well he went on to say about how all of these things, about fortune telling, about

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,840
psychics and everything is just superstitious nonsense.

116
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,760
So then the girl went on to explain and saying that it's not really true that many cultures

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,600
do things like, for example, read the tarot cards.

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,360
Alright so we had palm reading first, maybe talking to dead people with a medium.

119
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,880
But this is another tool that psychics use to communicate with maybe the dead or to understand

120
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
the future.

121
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,080
So we have tarot cards and they're actually cards, like playing cards, but they're a little

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
bit different, right?

123
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,440
They don't have diamonds and hearts, they have different pictures.

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,800
Right, they have pictures of, for example, a king or a queen or a picture of a river

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:39,120
or different symbols that basically the person who is getting their fortune read will take

126
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,120
it and move them and shuffle them and then will start flipping the cards over and then

127
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,480
you will see supposedly what your future will be like.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,240
Alright so those are tarot cards.

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,840
But we have one more word here and it actually comes from the friend who doesn't believe

130
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,380
in these scam artists.

131
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,160
It calls it all superstitious nonsense.

132
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
That's right.

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,760
So a person that is superstitious believes in superstitions and those are beliefs of

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
good or bad luck.

135
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Yeah that's right.

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,160
So if I believe that the number 13 is very very bad, I will avoid the number 13.

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,520
I won't sit down in chair number 13, I won't buy a house on floor number 13 because I'm

138
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
superstitious.

139
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,160
I believe that that number is bad luck.

140
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
That's right.

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,200
So many believe that it's bad luck to break a mirror or to walk under a ladder.

142
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,720
Yes, also many Americans believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside.

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
That's right.

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,120
So it's interesting because many cultures around the world have different types of superstitions

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,160
but we'll talk about that in a little bit.

146
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Why don't we move on now to some fluency builder and take a look at some phrases.

147
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:59,960
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,640
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments

149
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,920
for the next 12 months.

150
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,280
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo do you?

151
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,160
Well I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most

152
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,560
of the things the psychic told them came true.

153
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
Of course it does.

154
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,760
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

155
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,440
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

156
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,520
Well historically it's a practice that many cultures share.

157
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,040
Reading the tarot cards.

158
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,800
In the east they would even read tea leaves.

159
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,560
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

160
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
All superstitious nonsense.

161
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,320
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

162
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Great.

163
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
I'll book an appointment.

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Alright.

165
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,240
An important phrase that you don't have to be a psychic to use is booked solid.

166
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,560
Now we heard this in the beginning of the dialogue.

167
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,520
Right because this person is so famous that so many people want to go there and get their

168
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,800
fortunes read that this person is already booked solid for the next 12 months.

169
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Okay now booked solid is a very nice colloquial way to describe having no time for anything

170
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
in English.

171
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,920
So basically if a restaurant for example is booked solid it means there are no tables

172
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
available.

173
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
That's right.

174
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Nothing is available.

175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Everything is already reserved.

176
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,120
Yeah it happens also with hotels.

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,520
Some hotels during let's say the Olympics many of them are booked solid for the entire

178
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
month.

179
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Or you could even say this with your friends.

180
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,880
You say hey Marco do you want to hang out Thursday say 7 o'clock.

181
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,520
Sorry I'm booked solid the entire day.

182
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,360
Popular guy.

183
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
That's right.

184
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,360
So you can say that a person is booked solid or that a business is booked solid.

185
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,960
Now this next phrase is kind of more it's not really real words but we say they are

186
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,920
hocus pocus mumbo jumbo.

187
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,520
Alright hocus pocus is a way to describe superstitious things.

188
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,920
Like magic right because I think it comes from supposedly it's a spell that witches

189
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,800
or wizards will say like hocus pocus and things will appear.

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Abracadabra.

191
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Hocus yeah.

192
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,240
But basically this is something that we say when we're joking now in English.

193
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,840
So I'll say oh gosh Marco I just broke this mirror.

194
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,560
Seven years bad luck.

195
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,160
Do you really believe in all that hocus pocus?

196
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,480
Yes I'm very superstitious.

197
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,720
So hocus pocus here means superstitious.

198
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,200
Like magic superstitious stuff.

199
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
It's all hocus pocus.

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,520
What about mumbo jumbo?

201
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,120
Mumbo jumbo is also something we say when we're talking about magic or things that are

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
superstitious.

203
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,040
So I can say I don't believe in any of that superstitious mumbo jumbo.

204
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,480
It means basically I don't trust it.

205
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't think it's true.

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
I think it's silly.

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,440
Right so mumbo jumbo you refer to that nonsense that irrational or unbelievable stuff.

208
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right it's irrational.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Very good.

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,640
So hocus referring to magic mumbo jumbo referring to superstition or things that are not really

211
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,800
believable let's say.

212
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,720
And to end the dialogue the guy says well you know what okay let's go to this psychic

213
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,880
and see what she has to say just for kicks.

214
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Just for kicks.

215
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Now I love this phrase.

216
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,560
I use it a lot.

217
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,320
It's very very colloquial very spoken English so you guys should try to use it.

218
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,900
It means just for fun.

219
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
Just for fun.

220
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,760
So I'm not going because I believe.

221
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Right.

222
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,240
Because I just said I think it's hocus pocus mumbo jumbo.

223
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,800
But I do think it will be fun.

224
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
So let's go just for kicks.

225
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Just for kicks.

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Yeah.

227
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
So it means that you're doing something not seriously.

228
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
You're just doing it for fun.

229
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
That's right.

230
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,640
So you can do anything just for kicks really.

231
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,560
Maybe like if you just sit down and start doing some math problems just for kicks.

232
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
Yeah you would do that wouldn't you Marco?

233
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Just for kicks.

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Yeah.

235
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,280
Or I'm going to take a singing class just for kicks even though I don't take singing

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
very seriously.

237
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Right.

238
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,880
It's not like you want to become a professional singer.

239
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
You just want to do it for fun.

240
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
That's right.

241
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
All right.

242
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Great stuff.

243
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:24,240
Why don't we review everything one last time.

244
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,640
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments

246
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,960
for the next 12 months.

247
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,320
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo do you?

248
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Well I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most

249
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,620
of the things the psychic told them came true.

250
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,320
Of course it does.

251
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,840
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

252
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,520
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

253
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,600
Well historically it's a practice that many cultures share.

254
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,100
Reading the tarot cards.

255
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,880
In the east they would even read tea leaves.

256
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,640
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

257
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
All superstitious nonsense.

258
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,440
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

259
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Great.

260
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,200
I'll make an appointment.

261
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
All right.

262
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,120
So speaking about superstitions as you said some superstitions are more local.

263
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,400
Like for example I think it's Americans that believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella

264
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,120
inside a house.

265
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,920
I know that for example in China it's the number four is considered bad luck.

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
That's right.

267
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,160
So you'll see that many buildings don't have a floor number four or 14.

268
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
That's right.

269
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,240
And actually it's similar in Western cultures because some hotels will not have a floor

270
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
13.

271
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
That's right.

272
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,480
Are there any superstitions that are from Ecuador?

273
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,360
I think Hispanic.

274
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,880
There is one that's very particular with women with Hispanic women.

275
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,160
They will not put their bags, their purses on the floor.

276
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Yes.

277
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I've heard this before.

278
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
What is it?

279
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Your money will fly away.

280
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
Your money will fall out or your money will go away.

281
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,000
So women will not put their bags or their purses on the floor.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,920
That's why you will always put it on a chair or on the table.

283
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Never never on the floor.

284
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,200
They're very superstitious about this.

285
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Very interesting.

286
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,760
Well have you ever had your fortune told by a psychic?

287
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
No.

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
No.

289
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
I've never.

290
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
I've seen gypsies.

291
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,720
So gypsies are people that don't really live somewhere.

292
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
They don't settle anywhere.

293
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,920
They move around.

294
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,080
They go from city to city.

295
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,280
And I've seen them and they've approached me asking me if I want my fortune read.

296
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
But I don't really believe in that.

297
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,680
So it just seems like they wanted me to give them $5 and they would just tell me anything.

298
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
You think it was mumbo jumbo?

299
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,300
I think it was mumbo jumbo.

300
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,480
Have you had your fortune read?

301
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,760
I've had tarot cards read for me.

302
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,240
To be honest I don't really remember what my fortune was.

303
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,200
I don't remember if it was right or not right.

304
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,720
But I do remember feeling very uncomfortable because the things that my... and I don't

305
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,080
believe in these things because I'm not superstitious.

306
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,040
But the things that the fortune teller told me I thought were interesting because they

307
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,520
were very similar to things that I knew about myself.

308
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,560
So I don't know.

309
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,480
Some people... it's interesting because some people will go to a fortune teller just for

310
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,440
kicks and will actually agree or find it amazing what the fortune teller told them.

311
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
And other people aren't really just not really interested.

312
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,520
But it's very, very... it's very closely related to different cultures.

313
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,480
Some people have witch doctors that also will cleanse you or tell you your future and stuff

314
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
like that.

315
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
That's right.

316
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,740
So we're actually very curious to hear about your culture.

317
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,200
Do you have superstitions in your culture and are there traditional forms of fortune

318
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
telling?

319
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,720
Let us know, our website is EnglishPod.com.

320
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
All right guys, we'll see you there.

321
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Bye.

322
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:21,040
Bye.
