00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,920
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,920
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,480
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson today, one that takes place at the

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,880
office.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Yes.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,440
Today, we're going to teach you some great phrases so that you can ask people to help

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
you.

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Right.

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,480
And I think this dialogue is with a new person at the office.

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,280
So when you're new, you always need to ask people for favors.

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Exactly.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Okay.

15
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,160
So, we're going to be asking for a favor.

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,400
So, Marco, what exactly is a favor?

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,520
Something that a person does for you.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,160
Like a small, helpful thing.

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah, a small, helpful thing.

20
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,160
So, you know, like, can you pass me that pencil?

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,480
Maybe that's even a favor.

22
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Yeah.

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,920
Or maybe, can you pick me up on your way to work?

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Yeah, that's a favor.

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
Or even lending money to your friend.

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
That's a favor.

27
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Yeah.

28
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,600
So that's what we're going to be talking about, favors and how to ask for one.

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,500
Because you always have to do this at work.

30
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,960
At work, with your friends, with your family.

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,960
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the vocabulary.

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,880
Um, sorry to bother you.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
My name is Rachel.

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm new here.

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Can I ask you for a favor?

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Hi, Rachel.

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Welcome on board.

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

39
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,000
Excuse me, but can I bother you for a second?

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know what?

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,920
I'd love to help you, but I'm about to meet an important client.

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Do you want to ask Sean instead?

44
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,040
He sits right over there.

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Sorry to interrupt you, Sean.

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Could you do me a quick favor?

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
Actually, I'm working on a document that's due in a couple of minutes.

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I really can't talk right now.

49
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Sorry about that.

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Geez.

51
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,000
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:03,560
What's wrong with you people?

53
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,900
So a pretty busy office.

54
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,200
Pretty unhelpful colleagues.

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
I know.

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,920
Everyone's so busy they didn't help this poor girl.

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,080
Yeah, I hope she found the bathroom.

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
Now let's take a look at the language from the dialogue.

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,880
So let's start with language takeaway.

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,080
Language takeaway.

61
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,560
There's some great language in this dialogue, wasn't there?

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,920
Yeah, a lot of interesting phrases and words.

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,600
The first one that I saw that was really interesting is on board.

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
On board.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Welcome on board.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,320
Well, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used.

67
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,960
So let's listen to them to help us understand the meaning.

68
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,160
Example one.

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Welcome on board, Sarah.

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,400
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,680
Example two.

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,720
We need to get our new office assistant on board as soon as possible.

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,180
Example three.

74
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,080
We decided to bring Melissa on board to join the marketing team.

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
So basically it means...

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
Welcome to the company.

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Welcome to the company.

78
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Or...

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
The team.

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Yeah.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Welcome on board.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,200
So on board is the same as to the company.

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
I guess also when you get on a ship, they'll tell you welcome on board.

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes, that's where it comes from.

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Or an airplane.

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Welcome on board.

88
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,080
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
About to.

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
About to.

91
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm about to.

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm about to.

93
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,680
So this is a great phrase to explain that you're about to do something.

94
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm going to do this thing really soon.

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Okay, so for example, you can say, I'm about to go out for lunch.

96
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,800
Or I could say, hey Marco, let's go record a show.

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm about to go into a meeting.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Exactly.

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Yeah.

100
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
About to.

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,400
Going to do something really soon.

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay.

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,760
The next word we have is instead.

104
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Instead.

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Instead.

106
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Instead.

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Instead.

108
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,480
It means in the place of.

109
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
In the place of.

110
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Yep.

111
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,600
So for example, if we're at dinner, I could say, I'll have the chicken instead of the

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
fish.

113
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Right?

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Or I can say, I wanted to buy a red sweater, but they didn't have one, so I bought a blue

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
one instead.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Instead.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,440
So in the place of.

119
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Yep.

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,760
And our last word for language takeaway, interrupt.

121
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Interrupt.

122
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Interrupt.

123
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Interrupt.

124
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,120
So when somebody interrupts you, they come in and.

125
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,720
They talk to you while you're doing something or maybe while you're speaking.

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Or maybe you're busy and people come and.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Bother you.

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Bother you.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So interrupt.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Interrupt.

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
Okay, some great words here in our dialogue and now we can listen to it again.

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,420
This time it's going to be a little bit slower.

135
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:18,640
And you'll be able to understand the language a little bit better.

136
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Sorry to bother you.

137
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,680
My name is Rachel.

138
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,320
I'm new here.

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,080
Can I ask you for a favor?

140
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,240
Hi Rachel.

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Welcome on board.

142
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

143
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

144
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,160
Excuse me, but can I bother you for a second?

145
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
You know what?

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,400
I'd love to help you, but I'm about to meet an important client.

147
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,640
Do you want to try Sean instead?

148
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,480
He sits right over there.

149
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,960
Sorry to interrupt you, Sean.

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,920
Could you do me a quick favor?

151
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,480
Actually I'm working on a document that is due in a couple of minutes.

152
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,400
I really can't talk to you right now.

153
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,760
Sorry about that.

154
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Jeez.

155
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,520
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

156
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,240
What's wrong with you people?

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,080
Okay, so there are some great ways that you can ask someone for a favor, right?

158
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Yeah, we want to show you some really useful phrases for asking for help.

159
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
So let's start with putting it together.

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Putting it together.

161
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,680
Let's listen to some different ways of how you can ask someone for a favor.

162
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Example one.

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,200
May I get you to do me a favor?

164
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,280
Can you carry this package in your suitcase for me?

165
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,040
Example two.

166
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Can I ask you a favor?

167
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,400
Can you just finish this report for me?

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Example three.

169
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,920
Will you do me a favor and pass me that file?

170
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,320
Okay, so those were great examples of asking for a favor.

171
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,760
In our dialogue we heard, can I ask you a favor?

172
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,040
But we could also say, can I get you to do me a favor?

173
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Right.

174
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,320
Can I get you to do me a favor?

175
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,560
Also, I could say, will you do me a favor?

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Will you do me a favor?

177
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Right.

178
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,800
So those are different ways of asking for a favor.

179
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,520
Let's say you want to ask someone for a favor, right?

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
But they're busy.

181
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
So you'll need some phrases to help you do this.

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Exactly.

183
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,620
You need some phrases to interrupt somebody, right?

184
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,440
So let's listen to some examples of what phrases you can use to begin to talk to someone.

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, to interrupt them.

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay.

187
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
I hate to bother you, but...

188
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,440
I hate to bother you, but...

189
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

190
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

191
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,140
I don't mean to bother you, but...

192
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,240
I don't mean to bother you, but...

193
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,200
Okay, so those are really nice and polite ways of beginning to talk to someone.

194
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Exactly.

195
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,880
They're really useful at the office.

196
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,240
So maybe you want to talk to your boss, you knock on his door, kind of open it a little

197
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,440
bit and say, I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you have time for a meeting

198
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
today?

199
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,440
Or you could say, I hate to bother you, but do you have time for a meeting today?

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,560
Exactly.

201
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,360
So those are great ways of starting up a conversation and maybe setting it up to ask for a favor,

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
right?

203
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
So we can combine them.

204
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,960
I could say, I hate to bother you, but can you do me a favor?

205
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Perfect.

206
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Right?

207
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Yeah, really useful.

208
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,160
So then you can ask someone for a favor.

209
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Yep.

210
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Okay, great stuff.

211
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
So I guess we can listen to our dialogue again.

212
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Yeah, let's listen to our dialogue for the third time and this time I'm sure you'll understand

213
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,480
it a lot better.

214
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm sorry to bother you.

215
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
My name is Rachel.

216
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm new here.

217
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Can I ask you for a favor?

218
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Hi, Rachel.

219
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Welcome on board.

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

221
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

222
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Excuse me, but can I bother you for a second?

223
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
You know what?

224
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
I'd love to help you, but I'm about to meet an important client.

225
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Do you want to ask Sean instead?

226
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,720
He sits right over there.

227
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,080
Sorry to interrupt you, Sean.

228
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Could you do me a quick favor?

229
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
Actually, I'm working on a document that's due in a couple of minutes.

230
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I really can't talk right now.

231
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Sorry about that.

232
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Geez, I just want to know where the bathroom is.

233
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:06,200
What's wrong with you people?

234
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Alright so now you have all the vocabulary necessary the next time you need to ask someone

235
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
for a favor.

236
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Yes.

237
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,680
You can do that in your office, with your friends, with your family, anyone.

238
