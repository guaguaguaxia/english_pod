00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,920
Katrina And I'm Katrina and today we have a fun game

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,520
focused lesson for you.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,520
Marco That's right.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,600
Today we have an elementary lesson and it's all about playing board games.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
Katrina Okay and the game in today's lesson is a

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,480
famous one.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
It's called Monopoly.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
Marco Monopoly.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,840
Katrina I don't know if you have this in your countries.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,680
It's a game in which you try to earn money and sell property and buy property.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,480
That means hotels, houses, things like that.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,600
And it's very famous.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,440
We're going to learn more about this game today.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,040
So let's take a listen to our dialogue for the first time.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,720
Hey, why did you take that money?

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,280
You are such a cheater.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,160
I should send you to jail.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,640
I am not cheating.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
When you pass go, you collect $200.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Everyone knows that.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,320
Well, you can't just take the money.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,400
You have to ask the bank for money.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
And I'm the banker.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Banker?

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Yes.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Can I have my $200, please?

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Sure.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Here you are.

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
$200.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Thank you.

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Please come again.

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,720
Alright, we're back.

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
So we saw some very interesting words there.

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
The dialogue is two people playing.

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,920
So why don't we take a look at some of those words used in language takeaway.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,960
Language takeaway.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,040
This first word we can hear when we play games.

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,440
It's not a good thing to be, but it's very common.

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
The word is cheater.

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
A cheater.

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Alright, and that's a noun.

45
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,360
A person that is a cheater.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,160
If somebody says, you are a cheater, what does that mean?

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,040
This means the person is not honest at games.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,120
For example, Marco, you and I are playing a card game.

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
And you go to the bathroom.

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,920
And then I take the cards I want.

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,160
I hide the cards I don't want.

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
That's called cheating.

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Right.

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,840
Okay, the verb, to cheat.

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,120
But here, a person who cheats is a cheater.

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Okay.

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
You're a cheater.

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
He's a cheater.

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Alright, and remember that you say cheater, right?

60
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,480
Because sometimes many people that are learning English would say, you are a cheat.

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Right?

62
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,760
A cheater here is the noun.

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,820
That means it's the name of the person who does this.

64
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,960
He is a cheater.

65
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
They are cheaters.

66
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Okay.

67
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,280
And well, moving on, sometimes cheaters and people that steal things are sent to jail.

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
That's right.

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,960
So, if you go to a casino and you cheat, you use a cell phone or you use some kind of a

70
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,280
computer device to win money.

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,780
This is called cheating.

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,640
And the casino will send you to jail.

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,880
Alright, so jail is the place where people go.

74
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,560
What's the difference between prison and jail?

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
Basically, they're the same thing.

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Okay.

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,960
Two words for the same thing.

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,000
People who break the law, people who do bad things, go to jail.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Not just cheaters.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Alright.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
So, now you have another word.

82
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,760
Maybe you've seen that show Prison Break.

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,200
And so, jail is pretty much the same thing.

84
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,360
So, the show could have been called Jail Break.

85
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
That's right.

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
But yeah.

87
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Alright.

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,960
So, moving on, our third word is the person who's handling money says, well, you know

89
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
what?

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
I'm the banker.

91
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
A banker.

92
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Cheater, banker.

93
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,960
So, you know already, banker is probably a person.

94
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
This is a job.

95
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,920
So, a banker is a person who works at a bank.

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Okay.

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,720
So, but what about the person that helps you when you go to the bank, like that gives you

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
the money and the bank teller.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,640
It's not the same as a banker, right?

100
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
No.

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Generally speaking, a person who gives you money and collects your money, this is a teller.

102
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
A bank teller.

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
A bank teller.

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,880
A banker is someone who works in the bank to make big decisions, to invest money, to

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
give loans.

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Okay.

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,480
So, usually, maybe managers or executives are bankers.

108
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
That's right.

109
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Okay.

110
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,960
And moving on to our last word here, we have a verb and that is to collect.

111
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Right.

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,400
So, in the conversation between these two people, Karen, the woman, says, when you pass

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,840
a go, you collect $200.

114
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Okay.

115
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,920
So, to collect means to get.

116
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
That's right.

117
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
To get or to take.

118
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,480
So, at the end of every month, my landlord comes to my house to collect rent.

119
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,640
That means to take money from me for the house or the apartment.

120
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Okay.

121
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Good.

122
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,960
So, now you have another way to say to get or to acquire.

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
That's right.

124
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Alright.

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
So, very interesting.

126
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Why don't we go back?

127
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,160
We'll go back to the dialogue again and we'll take a look at all of these words that we

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,960
just saw and when we return, we'll take a look at some phrases.

129
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,280
Hey, why did you take that money?

130
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
You are such a cheater.

131
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,680
I should send you to jail.

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,180
I am not cheating.

133
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,400
When you pass go, you collect $200.

134
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
Everyone knows that.

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,840
Well, you can't just take the money.

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
You have to ask the bank for money and I'm the banker.

137
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Banker?

138
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Yes.

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Can I have my $200, please?

140
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Sure.

141
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Here you are.

142
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
$200.

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Thank you.

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Please come again.

145
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
Now, it's my turn to roll the dice.

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,000
Alright, we're back.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,400
So, now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,840
Fluency Builder.

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,960
Marco, you're such a cheater.

150
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,440
Such a cheater.

151
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm not a cheater but what do you mean when you say you are such a cheater?

152
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
So we know cheater, right?

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
That's right.

154
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
You could say this for many different things.

155
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,200
You're such a liar.

156
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,120
You are such a...

157
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Such a terrible person.

158
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,040
You're such a bad person.

159
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Right.

160
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,960
Normally, we say this when we want to criticize someone, when we want to say something mean

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
or negative.

162
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,960
You're such a means you're really a bad person.

163
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,920
You're really a cheater.

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Right.

165
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,440
So obviously because we are using a noun, we can't really use an adverb, right?

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,700
If you're saying an adjective like I am very happy.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,840
You can't say you are very cheater.

168
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
No, no, no.

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
You wouldn't say that.

170
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,760
You have to use a different sentence structure to give emphasis.

171
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,600
So in this case, you could say cheater.

172
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Right.

173
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,240
Okay, but that's not as strong, is it?

174
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,560
As such a cheater.

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
You are such a cheater.

176
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,200
That means, gosh, you're a really big cheater.

177
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,480
Right, exactly.

178
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,640
So this is the way that you would use that structure such a and then a noun that is describing

179
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
this person, right?

180
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,360
You could also use it for positive statements like you're such a good friend.

181
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Very good.

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,760
So then you are using the adjective.

183
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,680
You are such a good friend.

184
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
You're such a nice person.

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay, excellent.

186
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,620
All right.

187
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,360
So moving on, we saw another interesting phrase when he said, well, you know what?

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
You can't just take the money.

189
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
So what does he mean when he says can't just?

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,460
Okay, we could say you can't take the money.

191
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,500
This is basically a rule.

192
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,340
You can't take the money.

193
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,720
But you can't just take the money means there are other things you have to do before you

194
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,000
take the money.

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,840
You have to, in this case, ask the banker for the money.

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,760
Or for example, if I want to drive a car, I can't just go buy a car.

197
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,200
I need to first get a driver's license.

198
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,520
I need to learn how to drive.

199
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
I need to register.

200
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,520
So you can't just, just here means there's some things we need to do before this happens.

201
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Right.

202
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,320
You can't just means you can't do these things that easily.

203
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,800
You have to do other things before it, as you said.

204
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Exactly.

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
Okay, so very interesting.

206
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,600
We will try to use that one in a sentence.

207
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,440
But moving on to our last phrase, when the person said, you know what?

208
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,520
All right, you want your $200?

209
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,680
Here you are.

210
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Here you are.

211
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,400
So sometimes people think that this phrase means you are here.

212
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Right.

213
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Which it could in some cases.

214
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,880
Oh, yeah, that's right.

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,040
So basically, you're saying, I found you.

216
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Here you are.

217
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
I found you.

218
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
But in this case, this doesn't make sense.

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,360
We're talking about money.

220
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
We're talking about a game.

221
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,680
So if you think about this, here you are, you can imagine someone is giving someone

222
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,040
else a thing.

223
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,680
So in the case of the bank teller, remember we're talking about getting money at a bank.

224
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,560
A bank teller might say, here you are, sir.

225
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,600
Here's your money and then give you some money.

226
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,800
So this is something we say in English when we give something to someone else.

227
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Right.

228
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,120
Because otherwise, I guess it's strange if you just, you know, give something to someone

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
and you don't say anything.

230
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Right.

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
You need to say something.

232
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,560
And if you say, here, that's very rude.

233
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
So this is a polite way to say, please take this.

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
This is for you.

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,720
You might hear this at a restaurant.

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Here you are.

237
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Here's your food.

238
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Here you are.

239
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Right.

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Okay.

241
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
It's a very useful phrase.

242
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,440
And so I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

243
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:51,040
Then we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

244
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,760
Hey why did you take that money?

245
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,320
You are such a cheater.

246
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,200
I should send you to jail.

247
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,680
I am not cheating.

248
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,920
When you pass go, you collect $200.

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,320
Everyone knows that.

250
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,360
Well, you can't just take the money.

251
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,420
You have to ask the bank for money.

252
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
And I'm the banker.

253
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Banker?

254
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
Yes.

255
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,440
Can I have my $200 please?

256
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Sure.

257
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Here you are.

258
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
$200.

259
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Thank you.

260
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Please come again.

261
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

262
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,680
Alright, we're back.

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
So a lot of interesting words there.

264
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
A lot of interesting phrases.

265
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
They're really interesting and very useful.

266
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,960
So remember to try and use such a, you can't just, or here you are, when you're giving

267
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
something to someone.

268
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
That's right.

269
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
These are really great.

270
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,880
And I recommend also playing some games.

271
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,040
Games are a great way to improve your language skills.

272
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,400
Monopoly, the game that they're playing in this dialogue, is a really fun one for numbers.

273
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,160
Because the whole point of the game, the whole purpose of the game is to make the most money

274
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,520
of anyone playing.

275
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,320
And this is a really fun one because you get to buy houses and hotels.

276
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,400
There's simple street names and place names.

277
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Like Park Avenue or the Boardwalk.

278
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,440
So you'll learn a lot of really great things about American culture and English.

279
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
It's a really good game, very popular.

280
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm sure they have it in your language, but if you could get it in English, that would

281
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,440
be really great.

282
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,400
And also another really good game to play with your friends to practice your vocab is

283
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Scrabble.

284
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,040
Scrabble, that's hard.

285
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,320
Scrabble is a game about words.

286
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,800
And so basically you have to make words out of letters.

287
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,000
And whoever has the most interesting words, unique words, that person wins.

288
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,040
So obviously it's a great game to improve your vocab because you also learn some words

289
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,740
that maybe you didn't know before and your friends knew.

290
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,320
So it's really fun to play.

291
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,200
Obviously don't play with any native English speakers because they might win.

292
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,840
But it's a really cool game to play if you have any friends who are also learning English.

293
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,120
You can get together, play Scrabble, and it's a fun way to improve your vocab and to also

294
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,320
fight a little bit because all the time some people are trying to make up new words that

295
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
don't really exist.

296
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
We call them cheaters.

297
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Cheaters.

298
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,520
So yeah, let us know about your game experiences.

299
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Do you like to play games?

300
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,320
Do you have a favorite game?

301
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,680
Practice some of these and let us know how they go.

302
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,960
All right, we'll see you guys there.

304
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Bye everyone.
