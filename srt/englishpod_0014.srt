00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome to another great podcast with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,400
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,980
And today we have another really great lesson for you, elementary lesson.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,080
That's right, and it's another lesson about money.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,220
We have no money here at EnglishPod.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,640
We are in debt here.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,640
In debt.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Yes.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Okay.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
In debt.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
So, what does that mean?

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Why don't you tell us?

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,360
If I owe you money, I'm in debt.

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,160
In fact, I think I am in debt to you.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,800
You owe me $2.50 for a Coke Zero today.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
That's true.

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
All right.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Okay, so let's get started.

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,480
Let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,040
Vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,440
We have two words today in our vocabulary preview, and the first one is recession.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Recession.

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Recession.

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
Recession.

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,560
So, recession.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Everyone's talking about it right now, and what does it mean?

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
I don't know.

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,600
That's your job.

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
I don't know.

31
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
I really don't know.

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,920
Why don't you tell me, Erica, because this isn't my topic for today.

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,240
Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,680
In a recession, the country is making less money.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
That's true.

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,920
Maybe we can give a few examples of things that happen in a recession to show the meaning

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,440
of this a little bit better.

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Right.

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,000
So, for example, in a recession, many people lose their jobs.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Because companies might close or go bankrupt.

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Exactly.

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,000
And also, people start spending less money.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
That's true.

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,720
And the stock prices of companies fall.

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Pretty dramatic.

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,120
Yeah, they fall a lot, hey?

48
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Yeah.

49
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,400
That's what's going on now in the United States.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Very true.

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Okay.

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
So, let's take a look at our second word, and it has to do with recession.

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
It's broke.

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Broke.

55
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Broke.

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm broke.

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Broke.

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,320
It means that you have no money.

59
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
You're broke.

60
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
I'm broke.

61
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Right.

62
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,560
So, these are our two words for vocabulary preview today, and you're going to hear them

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,880
in the dialogue.

64
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,480
This dialogue is about a man who is in debt.

65
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,880
He's broke.

66
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,800
Let's find out what happens.

67
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm here to see Mr. Corleone.

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Right this way, sir.

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:56,840
Charlie, what can I do for you?

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,480
Mr. Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
Anything for you, Charlie.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Your father was like a brother to me.

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,320
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

75
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,600
I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,320
I see.

77
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,960
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my mortgage,

78
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
and on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,480
So you're asking for a loan.

80
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,880
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
What?

82
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,000
At a time like this?

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,640
I'm broke too, you know.

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,600
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,040
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Go on.

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Get out of here.

88
00:03:40,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Okay, so that was a bit unexpected.

89
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, that was certainly strange.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He didn't go to the bank to ask for money, did he?

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,360
No, he went to the mob, and the mob is broke.

92
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,760
Oh no, you know it's a bad recession when even the mob runs out of money.

93
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,040
All right, so why don't we start by looking at our language takeaway.

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Language takeaway.

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,680
All right, so for today's language takeaway, we have four words from the dialogue which

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,120
we think are really important.

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Yes, so why don't we start with the first one?

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Loan.

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Loan.

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Loan.

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Loan.

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
So, Erika, tell us about a loan.

103
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
What is a loan?

104
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,040
Okay, when you borrow money, you get a loan.

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
A loan, yes.

106
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Not to be confused with alone, like by myself.

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
No, so this is L-O-A-N.

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Loan.

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Right.

110
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,560
Okay, great.

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,800
Let's take a look at our second word, mortgage.

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Mortgage.

113
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Mortgage.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Mortgage.

115
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Now, this is very common.

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm sure many of you have mortgages.

117
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,600
What is a mortgage?

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,320
A mortgage is a type of a loan.

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,680
Basically, it's a loan that helps you to buy a house.

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
A house or a property.

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Yeah, so this is a funny word.

122
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,640
I mean, there's this strange mortgage with a T.

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,800
Yeah, it has a T in it, but you don't pronounce it.

124
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
You say mortgage.

125
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Mortgage.

126
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
So not mortgage.

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Not mortgage.

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Mortgage.

129
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Mortgage, yeah.

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,920
I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so I learned it well now.

131
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Okay.

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,280
Let's move to our third word today.

133
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,960
Hit me pretty hard.

134
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,280
Hit me pretty hard.

135
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Hit me pretty hard.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
Hit me pretty hard.

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,680
I think we have some examples that will help us understand this phrase.

138
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,400
Example one.

139
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,120
My divorce hit me pretty hard.

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm so depressed.

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
Example two.

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,920
This cold has hit me pretty hard.

143
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,360
I've been in bed for a week.

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,960
Example three.

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,040
The news of Fluffy's death hit me pretty hard.

146
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,520
I've been crying for days.

147
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
Okay, so that's a lot clearer.

148
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Yeah.

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Great.

150
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
Why don't we take a look at our last word for language takeaway?

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Tuition.

152
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Tuition.

153
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Tuition.

154
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Tuition.

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,280
So this is the money you have to pay to your school so that you can study there.

156
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Right.

157
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Usually, it's in college, right, or university.

158
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,160
Yeah, but sometimes in some countries, you have to pay tuition for public school.

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay, great.

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,000
So it's time to listen to our dialogue again, and it's going to be slower so we can listen

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,040
to all the words that we just talked about.

162
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,760
Hello.

163
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm here to see Mr. Corleone.

164
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,720
Right this way, sir.

165
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,600
Charlie, what can I do for you?

166
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Mr. Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,640
Anything for you, Charlie.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,480
Your father was like a brother to me.

169
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,800
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

170
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

171
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I see.

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah.

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,880
You know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my mortgage, and

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,480
on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

175
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,280
So you're asking for a loan.

176
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,200
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

177
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
What?

178
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
At a time like this?

179
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm broke too, you know.

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,760
You're not the only one who has been hit by the recession.

181
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,760
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

182
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,160
Go on, get out of here.

183
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:39,420
Okay, so I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now.

184
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,600
But you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue.

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Yes, I did too.

186
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,760
So let's start with Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,320
Fluency Builder.

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Fluency Builder is a tool that we use to help you sound more native.

189
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,040
Right, so you can sound more natural when you're speaking.

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,840
So we take a really common phrase, and we show you some great natural ways of expressing

191
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,240
that same idea.

192
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Exactly.

193
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,260
And today we have three of these examples.

194
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,460
Let's start with the first one.

195
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,660
So this phrase we use when we want to ask somebody, can I help you?

196
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,480
What can I do for you?

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,400
What can I do for you?

198
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural.

199
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
Right, so instead of saying, can I help you?

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,240
Or, I don't know, what do you need?

201
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,840
We can just say, what can I do for you?

202
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Exactly.

203
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,780
So let's move to our second phrase.

204
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,560
This phrase we use when we need something, when we want to say, I'm sorry to bother you.

205
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,920
Or, I'm sorry to interrupt.

206
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,360
Okay, let's listen.

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

208
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,680
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

209
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm sorry to trouble you.

210
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,800
This phrase might be a little bit more difficult to understand how it's used, but we've got

211
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
some examples.

212
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,960
Yes, so let's listen.

213
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,120
Example one.

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,840
Can I trouble you for a moment?

215
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,920
I just need you to sign this form for me.

216
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,440
Example two.

217
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today?

218
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Example three.

219
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,040
Can I trouble you for a pen?

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,760
Mine is not working anymore.

221
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,240
Okay, so now let's take a look at our last phrase for fluency builder.

222
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,720
On top of all that.

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
On top of all that.

224
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
On top of all that.

225
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,360
This is a really useful phrase.

226
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Marco, how would you use it?

227
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,160
Well, for example, today I lost my job.

228
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,200
Oh no.

229
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
My car got stolen.

230
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,480
Oh my God.

231
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,280
And on top of all that, my girlfriend broke up with me.

232
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
That was a terrible day.

233
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
It was, but don't worry.

234
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,880
You can use this phrase also in a positive way.

235
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
That's true.

236
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,600
You could say, so today was a really great day.

237
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,180
It was my birthday and all my friends came to visit me and on top of all that, I got

238
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,460
a million presents.

239
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,560
That is a great day.

240
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,080
So you can use on top of all that in this way.

241
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,640
Just like and also.

242
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
And also, yeah.

243
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Yeah.

244
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
So on top of all that.

245
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,760
So we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

246
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,260
We can hear all the words that we just talked about and all the phrases and you'll definitely

247
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,280
be able to understand a lot better now.

248
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Hello.

249
00:11:50,920 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm here to see Mr. Corleone.

250
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,640
This way, sir.

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:18,560
Charlie, what can I do for you?

252
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,200
Mr. Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

253
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,520
Anything for you, Charlie.

254
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,000
Your father was like a brother to me.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,720
I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

257
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
I see.

258
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,160
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments.

259
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,640
I've got to pay my mortgage.

260
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,400
And on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

261
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,080
So you're asking for a loan.

262
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,640
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

263
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
What?

264
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,680
At a time like this?

265
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,240
I'm broke too, you know.

266
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,280
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

267
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,720
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

268
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Go on.

269
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm out of here.

270
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,760
Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right?

271
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Yes.

272
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,280
And, and different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in debt.

273
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,640
Yes, that's true.

274
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,040
For example, in North America and in Canada, it's a really common thing.

275
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,960
Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt.

276
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,080
It's more than good.

277
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,360
It's necessary to be in debt.

278
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
That's right.

279
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,480
Unless you have a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your debts, you can't

280
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,980
actually borrow money.

281
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,400
You can't get a mortgage.

282
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,800
You can't get a car loan so you can buy a new car.

283
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Right.

284
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,880
That's called a credit history.

285
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,480
So you must have a good credit history in order to be able to, like you say, buy a car

286
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
or buy a house.

287
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Yeah.

288
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,960
And you know, the funny thing is, when I was in university, maybe I was 18 years old, the

289
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,680
first thing that happened at university was, you know, banks came to our university and

290
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,640
started offering you credit cards.

291
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
So you can get a credit card when you're 18, no problem.

292
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,800
And not only do they offer you credit cards, they give you like free gifts if you sign

293
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
up for a credit card.

294
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,520
So they really want you to have a credit card.

295
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,960
Of course, they want you to spend more money.

296
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
That's the trick.

297
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah.

298
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
But you know what?

299
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
It's totally different in Europe, for example.

300
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,960
I used to live in Switzerland and there, they're really careful with debt.

301
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,720
Like it's a bad thing to be in debt.

302
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Well, yeah.

303
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
I mean, it's bad to be in debt.

304
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Definitely.

305
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,200
For example, if I want to have a credit card in Switzerland and let's say I want to have

306
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,360
a limit of 500 francs that I can spend every month.

307
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,840
I need to put in my bank account 700 francs before I can even spend that credit card money.

308
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,040
So it's totally opposite from North America.

309
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Well, yeah.

310
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,100
I mean, in North America, it's crazy the way that people are in debt and it's showing now

311
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,480
with the recession, right?

312
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,520
Yeah, that's true.

313
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,320
So everyone, be sure to handle your money carefully.

314
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,720
Don't be in debt unless you really, really have to.

315
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,480

It's been fun.

326
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Yes, it has.

327
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
But sadly, we have to go now.

328
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,680
So until next time, it's...

329
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Goodbye.

330
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Goodbye.
