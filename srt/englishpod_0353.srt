00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,760
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about American education and college life.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
That's right.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,280
This is actually a user suggestion that they wanted to know more or less what it would

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,920
be like a dialogue between friends on a typical day in college.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,760
Alright so this is an advanced level lesson.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
We're going to be talking in a normal conversational speed.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,360
We're going to listen to the dialogue and when we come back we'll talk about some of

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,760
these key phrases and words that might help you understand the dialogue better.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,320
Hey Jordan, is that you?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Long time no see.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Oh hey, no kidding.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,440
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,960
So how you been?

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,360
Settling into college life okay?

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,840
Yeah, I think so.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,000
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha so I'm living at the frat house now.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,680
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,560
That's totally cliche, but really I think it's been a good decision.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
What about you?

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
What have you been up to?

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
Well, not much.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,080
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,080
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,440
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,280
sure the credits count.

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,160
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah, it is a little bit.

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,320
I joined the Great Outdoors Club though, which has been a lot of fun.

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
That's cool.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,760
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Definitely pre-med.

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
What about you?

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,920
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major until our sophomore year,

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
so I've got time.

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
Oops, I'm late for class.

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
I've got to run.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Okay, take care.

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,840
Hey, nice running into you.

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,560
Yeah, you too.

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
All right, we're back.

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,320
So now let's start with all these words and phrases on Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,880
Language Takeaway.

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
So hey Jordan, is that you?

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
Long time no see.

51
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
I love this phrase.

52
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,600
Right, this phrase, long time no see, which if you look at it, it doesn't really make

53
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
sense.

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
It looks like we're missing a couple of words.

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
It looks like an incomplete sentence.

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,600
Yeah, like the subject, who?

57
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Right.

58
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,440
I haven't seen you, you haven't seen you.

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,440
So really the meaning of this is I haven't seen you in a long time.

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
That's right.

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,680
And actually I've heard that this phrase was taken from Chinese.

62
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,840
I've also heard that, so it's kind of like pigeon English.

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,200
And now it's very, very common in English to say this.

64
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
You say this with your friends.

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,720
It's very casual.

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,520
And yeah, long time no see.

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,800
Because if you translate this literally to Chinese, it makes sense, right?

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Yes, it does.

69
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
So it's interesting.

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,720
All right, so we haven't seen our friend in a long time.

71
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,680
And he's like, yeah, no kidding.

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
You know what?

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
I think it's been since orientation.

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,160
So what is this orientation that he's talking about?

75
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Now this is an important part of the average American college experience.

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,280
Orientation is a special time, maybe for one week or a couple of days, at the very beginning

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
of your first year of university.

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
All right, so my first week of school, I didn't have any classes, but I went to school and

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,720
with all of the other first year students, we're called freshmen, I had to do activities

80
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
and meet people and sign up for classes.

81
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,080
And basically, orientation is a time when you learn about a new system or a new program.

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,080
So how it works, because maybe you don't really know yet how to pick your classes or where

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,840
the dorms are or how the meals work if you have to go to the cafeteria, etc., right?

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Exactly.

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
And it comes from the verb to orient.

86
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,520
So I orient myself by facing the right direction.

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,320
So orientation is really about teaching you how to start in a new system.

88
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay, very good.

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,880
So well, that was three months ago and a lot has happened.

90
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Our speaker says that he pledged Phi Iota Alpha.

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,680
So what is this to pledge in this?

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,800
Now this is Greek as well.

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Phi Iota Alpha is Greek and this means that we're talking about a fraternity.

94
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,040
So fraternity is a group of boys, a sorority is a group of girls, and these are communities,

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,000
so social societies that you have to apply to be a member of.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
But we don't say apply.

97
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Right, you pledge.

98
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
So it's like I pledge allegiance.

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,600
You say I want to be in your group, I want to be in your fraternity, and so you will

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,960
have to do special things to become a member.

101
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,400
So the verb to pledge would be to basically to promise something honorably or faithfully,

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
right?

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Exactly.

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,080
And that's the nice way of putting it.

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
But generally when you talk about sororities and fraternities, these upperclassmen, so

106
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,240
third, fourth year students, they make the students who are pledging do very weird things.

107
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,860
So as you said, this is for these two guys, this is for a fraternity.

108
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,960
But if it's this type of club for girls, it's called a?

109
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Sorority.

110
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Okay, so it's different.

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,480
So I'm pledging this sorority, that means I'm trying to become a member of this sorority.

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,400
So I think it's worthwhile mentioning many of you have probably seen it in movies, these

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,200
fraternities or sororities, and they all have names based on the Greek alphabet.

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Right, so the letters, Phi, Iota, Alpha, or Kappa, Kappa, Gamma, these are the letters

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,840
that basically represent the name of the fraternity.

116
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,320
And what's interesting is that maybe I am in Kappa Kappa Gamma at my school, there's

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,760
another school with another Kappa Kappa Gamma, we're all related.

118
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,520
It's the same social community.

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,560
So they sometimes do events together, things like that.

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,120
So actually these fraternities or sororities, it's not independent to a school, it's actually

121
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,440
like a wide network of people that belong to this club.

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,200
Exactly, it's a national network usually.

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,080
So it's kind of like being in the Boy Scouts.

124
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,880
Yeah, similar except the activities are much different.

125
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
That's right.

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,840
So these people, they may live at the frat house, like in this dialogue, he's living

127
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,120
at the frat house.

128
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,920
Now remember here, fraternity, that becomes frat if we're talking colloquially.

129
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,960
So the frat house is the fraternity house, it's where those boys live, but only the Phi,

130
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,200
Iota, Alpha boys.

131
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,600
Right, so no one, if I have a friend and he's not Phi, Iota, Alpha, then he can't live there.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,200
Exactly, and we have a similar thing for girls, that's the sorority house.

133
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
Okay, very good.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,920
So a frat house is the fraternity house, basically like their club house.

135
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,560
Where they live though, yeah.

136
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,520
And so sometimes guys that belong to fraternities, they're referred to as frat boys.

137
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Hey, frat boy, yeah, so fraternity boy, this is not always the nicest thing to say, it's

138
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,000
got a negative meaning, because a lot of the activities that frat boys do stereotypically

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,640
involve lots of drinking and maybe being loud.

140
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,120
So frat boy is someone who's in a fraternity and it's usually a critical way of talking

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,340
about those guys.

142
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,720
So this whole fraternity, sorority thing, as he said, is a little bit cliche, right?

143
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Yeah, this is a great word, I use this a lot actually.

144
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:30,120
So something that's cliche would be almost what's expected, but in a bad way, right?

145
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
And so...

146
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
So you joining a fraternity is a little bit cliche, because it's kind of like...

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,880
It's what everyone does in the movies and on TV, like, oh, I'm going to college, I'm

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
going to join a fraternity.

149
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,800
It's almost like boring, it's so normal.

150
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,120
But you could also say that like that movie, at the end of the movie, the man and the woman,

151
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,960
they fought, but then they got back together, it's so cliche.

152
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,840
So it's something that's overused, expected, very typical.

153
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Uninteresting.

154
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,900
Uninteresting, okay.

155
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,960
So we have a cliche, we're saying that a fraternity is cliche.

156
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,360
Now, the other guy on the other hand is living off campus, he lives at home, but he said

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,240
he commutes to school every day.

158
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,120
So he says, I'm commuting to school.

159
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
This is interesting.

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,560
Now in America, there's usually two options.

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,720
One is to live on campus, that means to live at your university in a dormitory or an apartment.

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
But many people commute, and this means they drive to school every day, and then they drive

163
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,040
home at night, they don't live on the campus.

164
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,840
So you can also commute to work every day, right?

165
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
This is what people do, you don't live at the office.

166
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Exactly.

167
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
I hope not.

168
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,920
No, this is a common thing, people will drive to work, and you might ask them, how long

169
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
is your commute?

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,160
So you say, oh, one hour, that means I drive one hour to work.

171
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,480
So if I take the bus or the train, the subway, is that also commuting?

172
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,100
It is, it doesn't matter how you do it, it just means you don't live where you work or

173
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,280
where you study, so you have to travel there by some means of transportation.

174
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Okay.

175
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,400
So, well, now going back to the academic aspect of this dialogue, he said that he ended up

176
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,160
dropping a class.

177
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,900
Okay, so to drop means to stop attending a class.

178
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,760
Maybe you don't have enough time, maybe you don't like it, but to drop a class means you

179
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,920
will no longer study, you will not take the tests, you will not get a grade.

180
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,240
It's the opposite of to sign up for a class or to register for a class.

181
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,520
So the difference between dropping a class and failing a class is that basically you're

182
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,520
making the decision to not go there anymore.

183
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Exactly.

184
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,080
So usually there's a time you can do this, so for the first two weeks you can attend

185
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,400
classes and if you don't have enough time or you don't like a class, you can drop the

186
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
class.

187
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,480
But if you stay in the class, you just don't come or you do very poorly on your tests,

188
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,640
that's called failing.

189
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,760
So there are some classes, because I don't know, can you drop any class or do you have

190
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,440
to take them at some point?

191
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
That's a good question.

192
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,960
That's our next phrase, that's a prerequisite course, right?

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,960
So usually the university in America will tell you, you have to study math, you have

194
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,300
to study one semester of science, you have to study English for one semester.

195
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,120
So these are called prerequisites.

196
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,240
It's when the university tells you, you have to study something.

197
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,760
And I think you also have some courses that you can't take until you've passed some other

198
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
course, right?

199
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,480
So for example, you can't take economy unless you've passed calculus.

200
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Exactly.

201
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
So that's another prerequisite.

202
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,160
So we'd say, the prerequisite for economics is calculus one.

203
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,800
Or the prerequisite for Spanish 200 is Spanish 100.

204
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,440
Means you have to take something before you take something else.

205
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,080
So there's two meanings of the word, but they're both related to requirements, what you have

206
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
to do.

207
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,840
Okay, you need a requirement.

208
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Now moving on and talking about the major, he said, well, if you decided on a major and

209
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
he said, well, pre-med.

210
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,200
All right, so major, first of all, is what you choose to study, right?

211
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,840
The focus of your study.

212
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Exactly, the focus.

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,360
You might study other classes, but your focus, your main interest area is one thing.

214
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,840
And in his case, he's talking about pre-med.

215
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
Now what does pre-med stand for?

216
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Because it is a short version of a longer word.

217
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
So it's pre-medicine.

218
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,120
Yeah, okay.

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,640
So medicine is something you study if you want to be a doctor.

220
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,880
Because in America, you don't become a doctor after four years.

221
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,600
You have to go get your BA, your bachelor's degree, and then you have to get your PhD,

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
your doctorate.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,400
So people who want to go to graduate school first have to study many required courses.

224
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,760
That's the pre-med focus.

225
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,320
Okay, so that's what he's talking about.

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,980
He's definitely going to focus on pre-med.

227
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,400
He wants to be a doctor.

228
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,020
He's not going to be a doctor soon, but he wants to start studying to be a doctor.

229
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,080
So he will become a pre-med, a pre-med major.

230
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,880
And what about for lawyers?

231
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,880
I know that there are also something that you focus on before.

232
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
There is, yeah.

233
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
That's called pre-law.

234
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Same idea.

235
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,040
Pre means before.

236
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,600
So obviously, a lawyer needs to study for a long time as well.

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,120
And with your undergrad degree, so your first four years, you would study pre-law.

238
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,280
So this is what you focus on for your four years, and then you go into grad school and

239
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,040
become an attorney or a specific type of lawyer.

240
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
But a lawyer doesn't have to study for a PhD.

241
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,040
A lawyer studies for a JD.

242
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
That's called a Juris Doctorate.

243
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
That's the law degree.

244
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Interesting.

245
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Okay.

246
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,560
So, well, he's going into pre-med, but the other guy is like, well, I don't have a clue

247
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
yet.

248
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,240
And he doesn't have to declare a major until the sophomore year.

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,280
Okay, a couple of things going on here.

250
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,480
First of all, there are different names for each year.

251
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,480
So freshmen, sophomore, junior, senior.

252
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,000
One, two, three, four.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
So sophomore year is the second year.

254
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,160
So if you say I'm a sophomore student at XY University, that means you're in your second

255
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
year.

256
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Exactly.

257
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,360
And he says that he doesn't have to declare a major until his second year, until his sophomore

258
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,480
year.

259
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,760
And this phrase, to declare a major, is very important.

260
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,640
It means that you will tell the university what your focus will be.

261
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Right.

262
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
And you have to do this.

263
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,320
You can't just go to school and then graduate.

264
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,560
You have to say, I will focus on this because every major has what we just talked about,

265
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
prerequisites.

266
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Right.

267
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,720
So, but in this first year, you don't have to tell the university yet what you want to

268
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
study.

269
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
Maybe you just, you take a variety of courses and then you tell them, okay, now I'm going

270
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
to focus on this.

271
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Right.

272
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Exactly.

273
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
That's what I did.

274
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
And that's very common for liberal art schools.

275
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,240
Maybe if you're in a specific trade school or you're in a certain track, you would have

276
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
a different situation.

277
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,400
But for me, liberal arts, I studied history, I studied philosophy, I studied language and

278
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
literature.

279
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,520
And then my sophomore year, my second year, I decided, oh, I will study philosophy.

280
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
And that's.

281
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
So you're going to focus on that.

282
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Yes.

283
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
One thing.

284
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,920
So it's, it's interesting because, uh, in many other countries, the education system

285
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,960
requires you to declare your major before you start studying, right?

286
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,800
You say, well, I'm going to study business.

287
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,160
And then your, your four years are around that.

288
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,800
Whereas in some, in some places in the United States or for some majors, you don't have

289
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
to do that.

290
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
That's true.

291
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,520
In England, for example, you have one area of study, one major, and that's all you study,

292
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
right?

293
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,200
Because in, in, in the U S you can get a major in history with a minor in philosophy, right?

294
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Exactly.

295
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I was the opposite.

296
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,680
I had a major in philosophy and a minor in history.

297
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,480
So major means something bigger, more important and minor is smaller or less important.

298
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,200
And a minor is, uh, is your second field of study.

299
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,160
So you take fewer classes, but you still know something about that.

300
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,880
But do they always have to be related because like, for example, can you be a major of philosophy

301
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,400
with a minor in, I don't know, astronomy or something like that?

302
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Absolutely.

303
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Something like pre-med.

304
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,120
So medicine, it's hard because there's so many requirements, right?

305
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,600
But I had a number of friends who are major in computer science and a minor in, um, literature,

306
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
for example.

307
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,900
So you can, you can mix it up at certain schools.

308
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,480
So what would be the advantage of that, uh, of doing something like that?

309
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,840
You know, because most places or most education systems say that you or teach that, you know,

310
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,280
you should specialize, you should be focused on one area.

311
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,320
So if you're in computer science, then you should be focused on that.

312
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,400
So why, why would somebody specialize in computer science in their major, but then take a minor

313
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,880
in like literature or something?

314
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,200
Well, let's use that example.

315
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,040
I think one of the benefits for the liberal arts degree, and this is something they talk

316
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,200
about a lot in education, is that you have a broad area of knowledge.

317
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,240
So yes, you know a lot about computer science.

318
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,760
You have to, to graduate, but maybe in your future you will write articles about computer

319
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,960
science or you want a blog or you want a job that has a public relations aspect.

320
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,160
You need to know how to write, and you're not going to learn how to write in all of

321
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,880
your computer science classes, but you will by reading a lot and writing a lot in your

322
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,340
literature classes.

323
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,440
So some people like to say that it's very good to mix up business and languages or computer

324
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,040
science and literature because it's a way to be well-rounded.

325
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
That's right.

326
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,280
That's actually interesting because in most places, specifically in the exact sciences

327
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,520
fields, they focus more on that, like engineers.

328
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,880
It's all about engineering, math, and all this, but the human aspect, like you said,

329
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,980
or the liberal arts aspect, like literature or history, they don't get much of that.

330
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,400
So when you actually have to become a manager or write or manage people, you don't really

331
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,380
have the skills to do that because you never really took a class.

332
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,680
That's right, and it can be very hard to learn how to write well and to speak well all of

333
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
a sudden.

334
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Right, right.

335
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,240
And I think that's where people struggle also when they're applying for jobs.

336
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
So I don't know.

337
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,120
I believe in being a well-rounded individual.

338
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Obviously there's some benefits to being very, very knowledgeable about one thing.

339
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,560
So I guess we could ask you guys, our users, do you believe that it's better to be knowledgeable

340
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,040
about one thing or maybe more well-rounded and to be an expert in many different things?

341
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
That's right.

342
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Yeah, you should let us know.

343
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,160
Let's jump into our dialogue one last time.

344
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,560
Let's take a look at what everyone was saying and we'll be back in a bit.

345
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,600
Hey, Jordan, is that you?

346
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Long time no see.

347
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Oh, hey, no kidding.

348
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,700
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

349
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,280
So how you been?

350
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,600
Settling into college life okay?

351
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
Yeah, I think so.

352
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

353
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,920
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

354
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
Yeah, yeah, I know.

355
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,840
It's totally cliche, but really I think it's been a good decision.

356
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,800
Got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

357
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
What about you?

358
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
What have you been up to?

359
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,360
Well, not much.

360
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

361
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,360
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

362
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,360
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

363
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,720
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make

364
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,560
sure the credits count.

365
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,160
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.

366
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,600
Yeah, it is a little bit.

367
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I joined the Great Outdoors Club, though, which has been a lot of fun.

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,520
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

369
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
That's cool.

370
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,040
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

371
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Definitely pre-med.

372
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
What about you?

373
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,200
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major until our sophomore year,

374
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
so I've got time.

375
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,520
Oops, I'm late for class.

376
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I've got to run.

377
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Okay, take care.

378
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Hey, nice running into you.

379
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Yeah, you too.

380
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,120
Alright, so it's a very interesting topic.

381
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,320
Education systems are so different around the world.

382
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,600
The way that you go to college, how many years.

383
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,520
I know that in England you can do a master's in a year, I think.

384
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
One year.

385
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,680
Whereas in the States it's two.

386
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Or three.

387
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,240
I think even a bachelor's in England is three years.

388
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,400
I believe so, yeah.

389
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,360
But they also have an extra year of high school.

390
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
An extra year of high school.

391
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Fifth year, yeah.

392
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Oh, okay.

393
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
So every system is a bit different.

394
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,720
In America, generally, it's either two or four years for your college degree.

395
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,000
And then, yeah, it's graduate school for two, three, or four years.

396
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,200
Now one of the interesting things that I found is kind of unique to the Latin American education

397
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:42,200
system is that people can actually go to college for five years for majors like in business.

398
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,320
And what they do is they call it a commercial engineer.

399
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:54,600
So it's like an engineering major, but it's not really engineering because it's business.

400
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,240
So it's interesting because you go to school for five years to be a business major.

401
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Interesting.

402
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,040
Well, we have something called a joint program, J-O-I-N-T, joint meaning coming together.

403
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
And you could do that.

404
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,800
You could be, for example, a chemistry major, but also a business major.

405
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,160
And then maybe go into oil refinery or some kind of very specialized business where you

406
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,560
do need to know something about chemistry.

407
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,800
And that's called a joint degree.

408
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
That's really smart as well.

409
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Yeah, I think so.

410
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,040
Well, it's interesting.

411
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,720
Let us know what you studied.

412
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,120
Maybe you went to school for two years.

413
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,640
I think you can get a technical degree in two years?

414
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,800
Yeah, associate's degree or a technical degree for two years.

415
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,200
And then you can get a bachelor's, a master's, a PhD.

416
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,240
Let us know what your education background is like and how it works in your country.

417
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,800
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

418
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
We hope to see you there.

419
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
All right, guys.

420
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Bye.

421
00:20:47,800 --> 00:21:09,500
All right.
