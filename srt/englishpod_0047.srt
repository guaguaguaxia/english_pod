00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,800
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,800
And we're bringing you a very advanced lesson today.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
That's right.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,720
We're talking about another business topic, aren't we?

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,540
It's a topic that's kind of popular these days, all about efficiency and reducing costs.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,160
So we're going to be talking about the just-in-time philosophy.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,200
I don't know much about this philosophy, so good thing we've got Marco here.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,880
Well, what we are going to be looking at is not really in-depth.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,800
We're just going to be looking at some basic points of what a just-in-time philosophy would

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,480
be like in a company.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,680
But what we're really going to be looking at is the language to do with this philosophy,

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
right?

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,680
Exactly.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,840
We're going to be looking at some technical terms and some other useful phrases that you

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,680
can use when you are talking in a business setting.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
Okay.

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
Well, why don't we get started with the language then?

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Okay.

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,480
Let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,800
On vocabulary preview today, we have the word lead time.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,960
Lead time.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
L-E-A-D, lead.

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Lead time.

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Right.

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Like lead.

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,960
This is something that factories usually would use.

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Yeah.

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah.

32
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,600
I guess lead time is the time in between point A and point B on a production schedule,

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
right?

34
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Right.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
So you could have, for example, production lead time.

36
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,160
So that's the time between when you make an order and when the product is finished.

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Exactly.

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
And you could also have delivery lead time.

39
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,280
So the time between when you place an order and when the product gets delivered to you.

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,040
So depending on the companies, you have different lead times.

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,240
Some are three days, other are five days, other are 45 days.

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,960
And we at EnglishPod have a two week lead time for our podcast, right?

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
But our delivery lead time is every other day.

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
That's true.

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Nice.

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Okay.

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
That's all we're going to be previewing today.

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,240
So why don't we just listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain some

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:04,440
of these tricky vocabulary words that we'll see.

50
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,520
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,240
As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, we're

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,320
obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods.

53
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,080
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,520
So we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Why would we want to do that?

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,960
I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,720
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Right.

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,960
Production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing queue

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,720
length like, for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,240
machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,120
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,440
by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory, or working with a faster shipping

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
company.

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
I see.

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,800
That makes sense.

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,480
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,960
zero-defects quality program.

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,920
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items, and therefore, they

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
must be eliminated.

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,160
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
goes wrong.

76
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,760
I'm with you on this one.

77
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,720
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,040
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Exactly.

80
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,120
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
First.

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:59,680
Okay, so they're going to implement just in time in their company.

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes.

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,120
Yeah, I guess they're putting in some cost control measures.

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
So, Marco, there's some great language in here.

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,600
Why don't we look at it now in Language Takeaway?

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,760
Language Takeaway.

88
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,720
Okay, the first word today.

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
Redundancies.

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,000
Redundancies.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
Redundancies.

92
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
Redundancies.

93
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,280
So this is kind of a strange word because usually a redundancy is when you're speaking,

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
right?

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, maybe when you say something that's already been said.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Exactly.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,920
You say something that has already been said, but we also use it in the business world.

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,960
Right, and it comes from the base word redundant, right?

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Okay.

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Meaning extra, more than what's needed.

101
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay.

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,280
So when a person or position is made redundant, basically it means they get laid off, right?

103
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Right.

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,160
So redundancies are a synonym of layoffs.

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Exactly.

106
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Okay.

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
All right, let's take a look at our next word.

108
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Workstations.

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Workstations.

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Workstations.

111
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Workstations.

112
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,920
So workstation could be anything from your desk.

113
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
Yeah, or maybe a workbench.

114
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
A workbench.

115
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,080
Or even a place on a production line.

116
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Right.

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,240
So you're a certain machine or something like that.

118
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,720
So basically a workstation is the area where you work.

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Okay.

120
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,040
So you can say, can we get a new workstation for the new team member?

121
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,200
Or I could say, I want to move my workstation closer to my employees.

122
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
All right.

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
So workstation.

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

125
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
At a given machine.

126
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,200
At a given machine.

127
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,480
At a given.

128
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
At a given.

129
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,920
This is an interesting way to say at any machine.

130
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Exactly.

131
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Okay.

132
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,080
So this is operating exactly the same as here, the word given is operating exactly the same

133
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,880
way as any.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
As any.

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Yeah.

136
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Okay.

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,000
So let's listen to some examples of how we can change it up a little bit and we can use

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,880
this given word.

139
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Example one.

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,920
In this factory, how many cars are in production at any given time?

141
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,400
Example two.

142
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,040
On any given day, about 40 million people use the internet.

143
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,520
Example three.

144
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Firefighters have to be ready to attend an emergency at any given moment.

145
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
All right.

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,720
So any given time, at any given moment.

147
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Yep.

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
Um, any given day.

149
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Okay.

150
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,600
Now let's take a look at our last word today.

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Defective.

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Defective.

153
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Defective.

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Defective.

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Defective.

156
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Defective.

157
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
So if something is defective.

158
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,880
It has a problem with it.

159
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
It has a problem.

160
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Yeah.

161
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,280
We can say defective is an adjective.

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Right.

163
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,680
And the noun is defect.

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Defect.

165
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Yep.

166
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,120
So if something has a defect, it is defective.

167
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Right.

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,040
So for example, maybe you produce chairs and you make one and this chair is missing a wheel.

169
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay.

170
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
So it's defective.

171
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Yes.

172
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
The defect is the missing wheel.

173
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
The defect is the missing.

174
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Okay.

175
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,880
And before we listen to our dialog again, I want to take a look at this phrase.

176
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm with you on this one.

177
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,520
I'm with you on this one.

178
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,920
I'm with you on this one.

179
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
I'm with you on this one.

180
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
So what is that?

181
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
What does that mean exactly?

182
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm with you on this one.

183
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,760
I agree with you.

184
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,480
I agree with you on this point.

185
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Exactly.

186
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Okay.

187
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,840
So if you agree with somebody on a certain point, you would say, oh, I'm with you on

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
this one.

189
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I agree with you.

190
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Exactly.

191
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay.

192
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,480
So now, let's listen to our dialog again and we'll come back and talk a little bit more

193
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:44,160
about the history of this just in time.

194
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,260
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan.

195
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,960
As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, we're

196
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,040
obligated to look for more cost-efficient ways of producing our goods.

197
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,760
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies, so we've outlined a brief plan to implement

198
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,240
the just-in-time philosophy.

199
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,200
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

200
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,080
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

201
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920
Why would we want to do that?

202
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,640
I think this is not an area that really needs to be walked on.

203
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,400
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

204
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,360
Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing

205
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,040
queue length like, for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at

206
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:38,960
a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

207
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly

208
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,040
by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory, or working with a faster shipping

209
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
company.

210
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,960
I see.

211
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,520
That makes sense.

212
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,200
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a

213
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,720
zero-defects quality program.

214
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,680
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items, and therefore, they

215
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,480
must be eliminated.

216
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,920
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility

217
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,640
for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something

218
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
goes wrong.

219
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm with you on this one.

220
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,480
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

221
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,840
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

222
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Exactly.

223
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

224
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
First...

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:39,400
All right, so Marco, I mentioned at the beginning of the lesson that I don't know much about

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,680
just-in-time, but luckily you do, right?

227
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,360
Yeah, I know a little bit about it.

228
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
So tell me a little bit about where this philosophy came from.

229
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,800
What are the origins of this idea?

230
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,720
It actually became really popular with Toyota, and it was called the Toyota Production System.

231
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,560
So many people think it's Japanese, but in reality, the Japanese got it from the United

232
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
States.

233
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,520
It's a philosophy that was thought up by Ford Motor Company in order to improve their production

234
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
line.

235
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,880
But when the Japanese visited Ford Motor Company, it wasn't fully implemented yet, and oddly

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
enough, they found this philosophy working already in a piggly-wiggly.

237
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,240
What's a piggly-wiggly?

238
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,800
Piggly-wiggly was a chain of grocery stores in the United States.

239
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm not sure if they're still around, but yeah, they were really big, and basically

240
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,560
piggly-wiggly was using this to improve their whole system of shipping and of stocking and

241
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
everything.

242
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,200
Okay, so how does it work?

243
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,520
So basically what you try to do is make your processes more efficient, reduce the amount

244
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,040
of space you're using, et cetera.

245
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,440
And this was really important for Japanese because, of course, they don't have that much

246
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,040
space in Japan to have these huge warehouses like in other countries.

247
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,040
So what you're saying is they're producing goods just for the time they need it, right?

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Exactly.

249
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
So trying to not be overstocked or- Or have a long lead time or something.

250
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,980
Long lead times where you have to keep something in a warehouse, exactly.

251
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,000
So that's why it's so efficient.

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
And also it's about improving the efficiency between processes.

253
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,960
So what's sometimes called a bottleneck.

254
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,480
You can have really good processes in the beginning, but in the end, maybe you have

255
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,480
only one workstation that's taking all these orders and everything gets bottled up and

256
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
it causes delays.

257
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
It's slow, yeah.

258
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,800
So in the dialogue, they want to implement the just-in-time strategy as a way of avoiding

259
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
redundancies.

260
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,120
But it sounds to me like actually this might cause redundancies sometimes.

261
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Well, yeah, sometimes it does.

262
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Sometimes when you make workstations more efficient or when you make all your processes

263
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,600
work more fluidly, sometimes inevitably you will have to lay off some people that are

264
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
redundant.

265
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Okay.

266
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,040
Have you ever worked in a company where they've implemented just-in-time?

267
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,600
No, actually, I've never really worked at a place where this philosophy was working,

268
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,160
but I did used to work at a place where we had Six Sigma, which is a little bit similar.

269
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,040
Well, I guess we'll need a lesson on Six Sigma in the future.

270
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah, we'll see if we come up with Six Sigma and what it means.

271
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,520
It's kind of interesting, but we want to hear what you think.

272
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Yes.

273
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,960
Have you guys worked in a place where they use just-in-time?

274
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Exactly.

275
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,280
Or if you have any quality control measures or how does your company avoid having defective

276
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,560
items or defective services?

277
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,400
So visit our website, EnglishPod.com.

278
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,040
And Marco and I are always around to respond to your comments and answer your questions.

279
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Exactly.

280
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
So until then, it's-

281
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Goodbye.

282
00:12:42,040 --> 00:13:10,000
It's a nice day.
