00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Hello, everyone and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,800
Katerina And my name is Katerina and today we're

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,360
talking about a topic very close to my heart, music.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Marco That's right.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,920
We're going to be talking about music and more specifically, we are going to talk about

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,880
musical instruments that you would use in a band.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Katerina All right.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,440
And so some people like to make their own music, get together, hang out, play music

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,960
together, so that's what we're talking about today.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
We've got a new band that's going to start and before we get going, we've got a word

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,640
to talk about and let's check this out in today's vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Marco All right.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,240
So as I mentioned, we are going to talk about instruments.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,960
Katerina Instruments.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,520
So you could say musical instruments, but what is an instrument generally speaking?

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,920
Marco Basically, it's similar to a tool, right?

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,980
So an instrument is something that you use to help you realize a task.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,440
In this case, musical instruments is more specific, right?

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Katerina Right.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,040
So we're talking about things that you use to make music.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
A piano for example.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,680
Marco Is a musical instrument.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,160
Katerina Or the drums.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,440
Marco All right.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,600
So this is what we're going to be looking at today in the dialogues.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,160
So let's listen to it for the first time.

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,000
Katerina I'm forming a music band.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Marco Do you already know how to play an instrument?

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Katerina Uh, yeah.

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,520
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,440
Marco Aside from yourself, who are the other members

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
of the band?

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,000
Katerina We have a guy who plays guitar and another

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,520
who plays bass.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,800
Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,760
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

40
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,320
Marco Yes, I'm a singer.

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Katerina Perfect.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,520
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Marco Great.

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Wait, here?

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,960
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones, or even your drums.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,360
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,760
Katerina Dude, what are you talking about?

48
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
It's right here.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,520
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,480
Marco All right, we're back.

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,120
So apparently the band wasn't really a real band.

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Katerina It wasn't, but I have to say I'm very familiar

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,320
with this because I have a Nintendo Wii and I often play the game Rock Band so I can sympathize

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
with the characters.

55
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Marco So you also have your own band?

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Katerina I do.

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Well, virtually speaking.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Marco Virtually.

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Katerina And I know you do too.

60
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
Marco I do too.

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
That's right.

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,520
We are both fans of this game and this gaming console and that's why it's such a fun dialogue.

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,360
But let's take a look at some of the language that was used in this dialogue in Language

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,440
Takeaway.

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Language Takeaway.

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,880
Katerina Oh man, so I've been in a lot of bands and

67
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,000
I've been in a lot of musical groups so I can say that the first instrument we want

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,400
to talk about is maybe the most obnoxious, the most loud and hard to listen to.

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
Marco Probably, probably.

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,600
And that instrument is the drums.

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,320
So the drums, it's plural because you have many drums, right?

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Katerina Right.

73
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,480
You don't just have the dum-dum-dum-dum, the bass drum.

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,960
You have many different drums together and so we could also call this a drum set.

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,600
Marco A drum set.

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:29,960
All right, so why don't we listen to an example of what a drum set sounds like.

77
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:42,720
All right, we're back.

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,320
So I think that's clear.

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,880
Moving on to our next instrument.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,320
Katerina This one's maybe the most popular for young

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,800
people to start because you can play pretty much anything with it and it's also good for

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
sing-alongs.

83
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Marco Right, and that instrument is the guitar.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Katerina Can you play the guitar?

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,640
Marco No, I can't.

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,320
I actually wish I would have learned but I never got around to it.

87
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,160
Katerina Well, this is a really beautiful instrument

88
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,360
and there are many different ways to play it but generally, it's either wooden with

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,080
some strings or electric so it's plastic with some metal strings.

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
Marco Right, exactly.

91
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,720
So they have a different sound but why don't we listen to an example of what a guitar sounds

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,800
like.

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:40,400
All right, so great example of a guitar, pretty clear.

94
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
What's our next instrument?

95
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Katerina The bass and this one, it doesn't look like

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
the word that's written, B-A-S-S, so we say bass.

97
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
And it's actually a very low instrument.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,240
It's usually used to help keep the rhythm.

99
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,680
Marco All right, so it's similar to a guitar, right?

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Katerina Very.

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
Marco It's the same form but as you say, it's lower

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,520
and it makes a lower sound.

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Katerina Exactly.

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Marco All right, so let's listen to an example of

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,960
a bass now.

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
All right, pretty clear.

107
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
Moving on to our next word, we have an amplifier.

108
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,760
Katerina Okay, so amplifier, an amplifier is a thing.

109
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,280
It's usually a box that we plug in, it's electric or it's electronic and it's a tool to make

110
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
electrical instruments like the electric guitar or the electric bass louder.

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,160
Marco Right, exactly.

112
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,680
So an amplifier is any device that makes a sound become louder.

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Katerina Exactly.

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Marco All right.

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Katerina So this is really important for rock bands

116
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
the world over.

117
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Marco Very good.

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,760
Our next instrument or actually more of a tool is very useful for the singer.

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,120
Katerina Yeah, and it actually goes with the amplifier

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,760
in many ways because the microphone, this is our next word, the microphone is something

121
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,440
that you use to sing into to make your voice louder.

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,120
So right now, Marco, you and I are both using microphones.

123
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Marco Exactly.

124
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,760
So a microphone.

125
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Very good.

126
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,000
And we have one last word and this is a verb, to audition.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,080
Katerina All right, to audition.

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,640
So to audition means to show someone your talent, all right?

129
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:30,840
So oftentimes when you start a play or an opera or a musical group, you want to have

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
auditions.

131
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,680
You want to audition people to see how much talent they have.

132
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Marco All right.

133
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,840
So it's basically an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and abilities.

134
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Katerina Exactly.

135
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,880
Marco So a job interview wouldn't really be an audition.

136
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,120
Katerina No, a job interview has its own word.

137
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,000
But here we're talking about your singing ability, your acting ability, your reading

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,720
ability and sometimes we even have auditions here at EnglishPod to see how comfortable

139
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,080
people are on the microphone.

140
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,240
It's a way to have people show what they've got.

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Marco Very good.

142
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
All right.

143
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,320
So a lot of interesting words here, many instruments.

144
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,120
I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

145
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,080
We're going to slow it down a little bit and we'll be right back.

146
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,840
Katerina I'm forming a music band.

147
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,520
Marco Do you already know how to play an instrument?

148
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,720
Katerina Yeah, I told you a thousand times that I'm

149
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,360
learning to play the drums.

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,320
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

151
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,200
Marco Aside from yourself, who are the other members

152
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
of the band?

153
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,780
Katerina We have a guy who plays guitar and another

154
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,320
who plays bass.

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,560
Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

156
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,520
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

157
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Marco Yes, I'm a singer.

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Katerina Perfect.

159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,320
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

160
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Marco Great.

161
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Wait here.

162
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,760
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums.

163
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,200
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

164
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,520
Katerina Dude, what are you talking about?

165
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,800
It's right here.

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,880
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.

167
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Stan Alright, we're back.

168
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,280
So moving on with our lesson, why don't we take a look now at some phrases in Fluency

169
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Builder.

170
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Katerina Fluency Builder.

171
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,360
Stan Alright, so on Fluency Builder we have four

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
phrases.

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
What's the first one?

174
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,640
Katerina Well, this first phrase is really important,

175
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,880
Marco, because we're talking about bands and starting bands.

176
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,240
And so there's often a phrase we use to describe this.

177
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,720
We say to form a band.

178
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,760
Stan Alright, so you form a band.

179
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,160
Katerina It's like forming something.

180
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,720
To form is to shape it, to make it look like something that you want.

181
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,600
And so we can form artistic projects also.

182
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,760
But here we're forming a band.

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,640
We're choosing people to bring together to make great music.

184
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Stan Alright, so we can say form a band or you

185
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,120
can say as well, start a band.

186
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Alright.

187
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,520
So we're forming a band and well, his friend was surprised that the other guy knew how

188
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,560
to play an instrument.

189
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,360
So he said, I've told you a thousand times.

190
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,480
Katerina Wait, wait.

191
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,800
So he told him one thousand times.

192
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Stan No, not literally.

193
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Katerina I play an instrument.

194
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I play an instrument.

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I play an instrument.

196
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Stan Right.

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,560
This is a phrase and it's a little bit of an exaggeration to emphasize that I've told

198
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,280
you many, many times already.

199
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Katerina Great.

200
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,840
So this is something we say when we're trying to exaggerate like Marco said or to really

201
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,080
emphasize the point that like I've told you this before.

202
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
So mothers often use it.

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
I feel like we talk about mothers a lot here.

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Mothers often use this phrase when kids do something wrong.

205
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,000
They say, I've told you a thousand times not to wear your shoes in the house.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
Stan Exactly.

207
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,280
So it is a great phrase to really make your point that you've said something many, many

208
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
times.

209
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,160
Moving on, we have a kind of like a conjunction that you can use and it's by the way to change

210
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
the topic maybe.

211
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
By the way.

212
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Katerina By the way.

213
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,680
And so by the way, we keep these words together.

214
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,840
It's a fixed phrase.

215
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,160
By the way is something we add on.

216
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,840
So I say, you know, today I went to school and I saw a lot of people.

217
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, by the way, John says hi.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,240
All right, so while I'm talking about this, I want to add that this thing happened or

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
that this person said something.

220
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Stan Exactly.

221
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,080
So it is, it's a conjunction, right, to put together two different ideas.

222
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,760
By the way, or you can start off your sentence with it.

223
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
By the way, how is the new house?

224
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,600
Katerina Oh, because it's like, it's like saying, oh,

225
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,720
this thought just came into my head.

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
By the way.

227
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,920
Stan Right, right.

228
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,200
And our last phrase on Fluency Builder is we are set.

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Katerina All right, all we need is my Nintendo Wii

230
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,960
and we are set.

231
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,160
Stan All right, so what are we set?

232
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
We are set.

233
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,360
Katerina All right, we are set is another one of those

234
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,720
phrases that's fixed and it literally it means and we are ready to start.

235
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
We're ready to go.

236
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,960
Stan And everything is ready.

237
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
Katerina Yeah, we don't need anything else.

238
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,600
And so Marco, I could say to you, just bring, just bring the salad to the table and we're

239
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
set.

240
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
We're ready to eat.

241
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Stan All right.

242
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,960
And I think we're set to listen to our dialogue for the last time.

243
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:15,120
And we'll be right back and talk a little bit more about this great topic.

244
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm forming a music band.

245
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Do you already know how to play an instrument?

246
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,240
Yeah, I told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums.

247
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,880
Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.

248
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,520
Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

249
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,160
We have a guy who plays guitar and another who plays bass.

250
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,440
Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer.

251
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,480
You told me that you had some musical talent, right?

252
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,080
Yes, I'm a singer.

253
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Perfect.

254
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,600
So you can audition this weekend here at my house.

255
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Great.

256
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Wait here.

257
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,620
You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums.

258
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,240
By the way, where do you keep them or practice?

259
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
Dude, what are you talking about?

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,660
It's right here.

261
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,920
All we need is my Nintendo Wii and we're set.

262
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,160
Alright, we're back.

263
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,480
So rock band now.

264
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,200
I know that you play a real instrument, not only instruments on the Wii.

265
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
True.

266
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
What do you play?

267
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,400
I play the trumpet.

268
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,560
I was classically trained.

269
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,720
I started when I was 10.

270
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,440
Now is this the trumpet that has the three buttons on the top?

271
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes, three pistons.

272
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Three pistons.

273
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Because there's another one that doesn't, right?

274
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,560
There's one that has four pistons.

275
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,720
It's a piccolo trumpet, has four.

276
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,320
And there's one that's large and it slides in and out and that's a trombone.

277
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
That's much lower.

278
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Right, right.

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,880
But the trumpet is kind of a mid-range instrument.

280
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,560
It can go quite high and a little bit low.

281
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,880
And it's brass, it's not wood.

282
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
It's made of a metal.

283
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Right.

284
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
It looks like gold, right?

285
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Right.

286
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,760
Alright, so you play the trumpet.

287
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,360
Did you play in a band or in a school or college?

288
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,720
In middle school and high school, I played in bands and orchestras.

289
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,880
And in college, I played in orchestra and I've also played in rock bands because sometimes

290
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,840
people want to, you know...

291
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Have a trumpet in the background.

292
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,200
Have a trumpet and go a little crazy.

293
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Nice.

294
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Interesting.

295
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,880
This is interesting because I'm sure a lot of our users out there actually play instruments

296
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,360
and maybe a lot of them are also good at it.

297
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,480
So come to EnglishPod.com, leave your questions and comments and let us know if you play any

298
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,200
instruments or maybe some strange instruments like the xylophone.

299
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,400
Or if you like to play We Rock Band because we certainly do and we can support you on

300
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
that one.

301
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
We can give you some tips.

302
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Yeah.

303
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Alright, so we'll see you guys there.

304
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Until next time.

305
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Bye everyone.

306
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:56,500
Thanks for listening.
