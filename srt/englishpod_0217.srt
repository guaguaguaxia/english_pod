00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,240
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about helping other people.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
That's right.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,880
We are going to volunteer and to help other people that maybe don't have as much as we

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,760
do and so this is a way to give back to the community.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
That's right.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
So this is an intermediate level lesson and before we get going, we have a phrase to preview

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,360
in today's vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
All right.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,960
So in vocabulary preview today, we have this phrase, a soup kitchen or it's a noun, a soup

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
kitchen.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
That's right.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
A soup kitchen is a place.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,560
Basically, it is a place where volunteers can help cook and serve people who don't have

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,160
enough money to feed themselves.

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Okay.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,480
So that's a soup kitchen.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
It's basically a place where people can get free food.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
That's right.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Okay.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,880
So this is where we're going to be today.

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,020
We are at a soup kitchen and we're going to hear a couple of people talking about helping

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,600
out at a soup kitchen.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Let's listen.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
We really appreciate your help.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
to make ends meet.

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,280
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Don't be silly, Mark.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm more than happy to devote my time to a good cause.

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,760
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,640
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,040
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,720
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,900
The people who come here have fallen on hard times and a delicious hot meal can really

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,400
bolster their spirits.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,980
Wow, that smells great.

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,840
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Thanks Mark.

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Here you go.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Enjoy your meal.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Thank you, my dear.

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,760
Oh, this looks lovely.

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
You're welcome.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Hello, sir.

49
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Today we have George.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,760
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,240
Hey, Judy.

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,680
I'll have a little of everything.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Thanks.

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,400
Mmm, smells great.

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,480
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,080
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,560
You've got no right to be here.

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
You're hardly homeless.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Don't be like that, Judy.

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,200
I really miss your home cooking.

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,920
All right, we're back.

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,880
So obviously this person, what was he, George, he didn't really need the food, but apparently

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,260
I think he's divorced from his wife and he was like, oh, I need your food.

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,440
But other people that were there were very much in need of this food.

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,760
So why don't we take a look at some of the words and phrases on Language Takeaway.

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Language Takeaway.

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,320
Well, we've got a couple of interesting words here at the beginning that have to do with

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,240
volunteering or helping other people.

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,920
The first phrase we have actually is to pitch in.

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
That's right, to pitch in.

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,720
So when you pitch in, that's a way of saying helping, right?

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,200
That's right, to help.

73
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
So I could ask you for your help with something.

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,960
I could say, hey, Marco, can you pitch in a little of your time with this project I

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
have?

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,040
Okay, so dedicate or to help, to pitch in.

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,720
So when you pitch in, you are helping.

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,880
This is a really common phrase, very colloquial though, right?

79
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
To pitch in, that's right.

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay.

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,020
And then moving on, another adjective.

82
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:46,040
When a person likes to help or gives money to the poor, that person is generous.

83
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
That's right.

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
So generous is an adjective.

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,480
It means a person can be generous or an effort can be generous.

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,160
For example, a very famous generous person is Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,160
I was thinking Warren Buffett, but both of them are very generous.

88
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,080
Mother Teresa for giving back to the poor and Warren Buffett for donating most of his

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
money.

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Okay, very good.

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,280
So that is a sign of a person that is generous.

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,860
So usually generous people like Warren Buffett, you say he gave away his fortune to people

93
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,320
that didn't have money.

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,480
We call these people the less fortunate.

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
That's right.

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,400
So as you said, we've got three words here that mean poor people basically.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,280
And we don't like to say poor people in English because it's not very nice.

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,320
You know, people can't control their situation in many cases and it's more of a situation

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,360
of not having what others have.

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,480
And so one way to say this is less fortunate.

101
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,740
So a person that's less fortunate is a person that's poor.

102
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
That's right.

103
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,000
So for example, we often try to help the less fortunate by volunteering our time.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,280
Okay, so fortunate is a way of saying that you have fortune or you have luck.

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
So if you say you are very fortunate, that means that you are very lucky.

106
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
That's right.

107
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,840
Okay, so less fortunate means poor.

108
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,320
And another way of saying that somebody is poor, you say that person is needy.

109
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,400
Needy.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,500
So this probably makes you think of the word need to need and you're right.

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,940
This comes from need.

112
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,280
So someone who is needy needs things, needs money, needs help, needs food.

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,420
Okay, even attention, right?

114
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,240
Somebody that's needy might need a lot of attention all the time.

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
That's right.

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,000
So this could actually be a bad thing.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Someone who's needy says, look at me, look at me.

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh my gosh, look at me, listen to me.

119
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
And that can be very annoying.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Okay, so the needy.

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,400
And now finally, a very common word to say that somebody is very poor, doesn't have a

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,860
place to live, doesn't have a home.

123
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,880
You say that person is homeless.

124
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,600
Homeless literally means without a home.

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,960
And so we often talk about the homeless as being a group of people we want to help in

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,080
society because the homeless live on the streets, they live in public and in the winter and

127
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,640
times when it's really, really cold, it's very dangerous for them.

128
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,600
So the homeless are a group that people try to help with these soup kitchens and shelters.

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,320
Okay, very good.

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,960
So a lot of interesting words, common phrases, they're very useful.

131
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,000
So why don't we go back, listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit with

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Fluency Builder.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,880
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,480
We really appreciate your help.

135
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,440
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling

136
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,760
to make ends meet.

137
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,680
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

138
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Don't be silly, Mark.

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm more than happy to donate my time to a good cause.

140
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,120
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

141
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,000
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,440
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

143
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,080
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

144
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,240
The people who come here have fallen on hard times and a delicious hot meal can really

145
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,680
bolster their spirits.

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,320
Wow, that smells great.

147
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,200
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

148
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Thanks Mark.

149
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Here you go.

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Enjoy your meal.

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Thank you, my dear.

152
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, this looks lovely.

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
You're welcome.

154
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Hello, sir.

155
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Today, we have George.

156
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
What are you doing here?

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Hey, Judy.

158
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll have a little of everything.

159
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Thanks.

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Smells great.

161
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

162
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

163
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
You've got no right to be here.

164
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
You're hardly homeless.

165
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't worry, I'm not homeless.

166
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm just a little homeless.

167
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm not homeless.

168
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm a homeless person.

169
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm a homeless person.

170
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm a homeless person.

171
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm a homeless person.

172
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm a homeless person.

173
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm a homeless person.

174
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm a homeless person.

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I'm a homeless person.

176
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
What are you doing here?

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Mostly, the little house, actually.

178
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Enjoy your meal.

179
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,480
There is no need to be here.

180
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Yes, Joe.

181
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm Sergeant Hstock.

182
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
It's great to see you.

183
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
What is this?

184
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Don't be like that, Judy.

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
I really miss your home cooking.

186
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
All right, we're back.

187
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
So, on Fluency Builder, today we have three key phrases.

188
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,620
So, we're gonna take a look at those now.

189
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
OK.

190
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,080
So, what is that first phrase?

191
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,900
Our first phrase comes from the starting of the dialogue with Mark who says there are

192
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,480
some people who are struggling to make ends meet.

193
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,200
So, the phrase here is, to make ends meet.

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
OK.

195
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Make ends meet.

196
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,760
So, if you take a look at this phrase, it's very hard to determine what that actually

197
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
means.

198
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
What does it mean?

199
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Think about a string.

200
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,920
If you want to make a circle out of that string, you have to connect the ends.

201
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,960
I think of that as being about your income and the money that you spend.

202
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,760
I cannot make ends meet if I earn $10 every week but I spend $15 on my house and my food.

203
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,760
So, not being able to make ends meet means you spend more than you earn.

204
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,600
That's not about cars and fancy TVs.

205
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
That's about your house, your heat, your bills, and your food.

206
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,600
But I say, I've been able to make ends meet for a while now because I have a pretty good

207
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
job.

208
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
So, to make ends meet is to be able to pay for your necessities.

209
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,720
But he can't make ends meet means he can't support himself financially.

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,800
Very good.

211
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,720
To make ends meet is pretty much to satisfy your basic necessities.

212
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Financially.

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Financially.

214
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay.

215
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Very good.

216
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,360
And moving on, when we were talking about generosity and people helping out, if you

217
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,880
help people that are less fortunate, you are making a difference in a small way.

218
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay.

219
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,400
So, this is a phrase that we hear all the time in the States.

220
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm not sure if it's the same in other English-speaking countries but it's a very popular phrase.

221
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,040
We talk about making a difference or trying to make a difference and it's not very clear

222
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
what a difference really is.

223
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,120
But generally this means doing good things for other people.

224
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Okay.

225
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Okay.

226
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,000
So, celebrities try to make a difference with their money and their fame.

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,640
Some people try to make a difference by working at homeless shelters or at soup kitchens.

228
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,060
And so, there are many different ways to make a difference.

229
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,800
But it's basically the idea that you volunteer or you give money to help other people.

230
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Okay.

231
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Very good.

232
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,080
And if for example you recycle, you can say you're making a difference in the environment.

233
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
That's right.

234
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
You're making a difference.

235
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,240
Usually a difference is a positive thing.

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,840
So, keep that in mind.

237
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Very good.

238
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,240
And for the last phrase on Fluency Builder today, we say that people who come here have

239
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,440
fallen on hard times.

240
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,120
So, people that have fallen on hard times.

241
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,320
What does it mean if you fall on hard times?

242
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
Well, basically hard times are difficulties, right?

243
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,560
So, not being able to make ends meet, not being able to pay for your food and your housing.

244
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,040
And so, we have the verb to fall.

245
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,760
You've fallen on hard times because you've gone from a place where you're comfortable

246
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,040
to a lower place, a place where life is really hard.

247
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,240
And so, think of this as a fixed phrase.

248
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,400
He fell on hard times or they fell on hard times.

249
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,960
This means they don't have much money or they can't support themselves or they went bankrupt,

250
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
for example.

251
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,160
So, somebody that loses their job may have fallen on hard times.

252
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
That's right.

253
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Okay.

254
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,240
And there's one more phrase here that deserves a little attention.

255
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,120
We heard this word to bolster.

256
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,720
To bolster is a verb that means to improve.

257
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,680
So, a hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

258
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,200
It means it can make them feel better.

259
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,680
So, to bolster their spirits means to make them feel happier, to lift their spirits.

260
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
That's right.

261
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,840
Exactly what you said, to make them feel happier.

262
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Okay.

263
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Awesome.

264
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,640
So, a lot of interesting phrases there.

265
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,480
Phrases that you can talk in English about making a difference, about volunteering.

266
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,920
Very interesting stuff.

267
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,440
Very good for conversations between friends and family.

268
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,880
So, why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit

269
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:46,280
more.

270
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,360
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

271
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,960
We really appreciate your help.

272
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,940
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling

273
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,200
to make ends meet.

274
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,560
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,880
Don't be silly, Mark.

276
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm more than happy to devote my time to a good cause.

277
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Volunteering at the Soup Kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

278
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,480
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

279
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,920
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

280
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,560
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

281
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
The people who come here have fallen on hard times and a delicious hot meal can really

282
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
bolster their spirits.

283
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,800
Wow, that smells great.

284
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

285
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Thanks Mark.

286
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,240
Here you go.

287
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Enjoy your meal.

288
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Thank you, my dear.

289
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,600
Oh, this looks lovely.

290
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
You're welcome.

291
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Hello, sir.

292
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Today we have George.

293
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,560
What are you doing here?

294
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,080
Hey, Judy.

295
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,440
I'll have a little of everything, thanks.

296
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,240
Mmm, smells great.

297
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,320
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

298
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

299
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,360
You've got no right to be here.

300
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,200
You're hardly homeless.

301
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,480
Don't be like that, Judy.

302
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,040
I really miss your home cooking.

303
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,800
Alright, we're back.

304
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,080
So talking about volunteering, have you ever done any volunteer work?

305
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
I have.

306
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
I've done it a bit, actually.

307
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Yeah?

308
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
What have you done?

309
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,520
Back when I was living in the United States, in Chicago, I used to cook for a homeless shelter

310
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
every week.

311
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,880
So I would bring food every Thursday.

312
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
So you cook at home and you bring the food over to the shelter?

313
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
That's right.

314
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,920
So the shelter had a kitchen, but they used donations from people because there are so

315
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,840
many people who came there for food.

316
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,160
And once a month I would volunteer to also serve the food.

317
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,800
So I would bring lasagna or pasta, things that most people like.

318
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
And then once a month I would sit down with people and talk.

319
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,760
You know, a lot of people are lonely when they're in homeless shelters because they

320
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,680
come alone or maybe it's the mother and her child.

321
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,120
It's nice to also come and sit and talk to them.

322
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,560
No, it's very interesting and I think volunteering is a much better solution than, for example,

323
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,320
just giving out money to poor people or something like that.

324
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,480
I don't think that's really the solution.

325
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,760
I think you should dedicate your time and your energy to making a difference, like in

326
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
the dialogue.

327
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,240
And I think that the other benefit is for you, the volunteer, because it changes your

328
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,960
perspective on poverty and on humanity.

329
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,700
And you think about, well, you know, I could be this person.

330
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,880
He was a banker two years ago and now he doesn't have a house.

331
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
And so I think it has a positive effect on everybody involved.

332
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Yeah, for sure.

333
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,000
No, I think it's a very rewarding experience.

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,160
And I think EnglishPod definitely supports that you should volunteer, you should make

335
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
a difference.

336
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,600
And I think we can all help each other, right?

337
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
That's right.

338
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,000
Have you ever volunteered?

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,680
What kind of volunteer work have you done?

340
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,840
Has it been environmental or social?

341
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,760
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

342
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
We hope to see you there.

343
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
All right.

344
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Bye, everyone.

345
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Thank you.
