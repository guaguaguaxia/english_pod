00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,200
My name is Catherine and today we've got another episode in our series about giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
That's right.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,680
Today we're going to talk about some key elements of the topic that we're talking about.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,840
We're talking about a laptop computer.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,800
So we're going to give some more details and characteristics about the computer and what

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,260
makes it so special.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,080
So let's take a listen to what Mr. Ford has to say about what makes this company's computers

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,240
very special.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,120
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,020
our previous models and also of course with some of our competitors.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,120
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,280
This is a key question and it's something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,800
Firstly the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,640
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,960
laptop computers.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,320
It is only two pounds which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,920
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine it's very powerful.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,880
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,880
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
15 inch LCD display.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,800
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,400
Compared with our previous X540 range it really is in a league of its own.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,080
for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,680
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
this figure at the very least.

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,040
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm certain that in the coming three years the X420 will actually overtake all our existing

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,040
products both in terms of sales and revenue.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:15,840
Okay now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Alright we're back.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,040
So we obviously heard a lot of vocab here, a lot of interesting things regarding the

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
computer.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,640
Why don't we take a look at some of the words that he used on language takeaway.

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,040
Language takeaway.

39
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,160
So the first word that is pretty challenging is to differentiate.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
It's a verb.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,760
So Mr. Ford says, ask yourself what it is that differentiates this new computer line

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
with other ones.

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
That's right.

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,120
So to differentiate, that means what makes it different, what is so special about it,

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
right?

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
That's right.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
So you can ask a question like this.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,880
What differentiates Apple computers from other computers?

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
That's right.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
So you're asking what makes it so different.

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
That's right.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Okay.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,480
So then he rephrases the question and he says, well in other words, what makes the X420 stand

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,280
out from all the other computers?

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,160
All right, so this is a verbal phrase to stand out.

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,200
It's very similar to the one that we just mentioned to differentiate.

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,220
This means what makes this computer special?

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,760
Why is it unique?

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
That's right.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,040
So we're basically saying, why is this one more noticeable than the rest?

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,320
That's to stand out.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,160
So maybe if everyone in the office is wearing white t-shirts today, but somebody comes in

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,680
wearing a red t-shirt, that person is going to stand out.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,520
Actually, Marco, I think today that's you.

65
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,920
You're wearing a red t-shirt today, so you stand out.

66
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Okay.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,560
So now as he continued to talk about the computer, he used this prefix before an adjective.

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
That was very interesting.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,520
He said, this computer is ultra light.

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,320
And then he said it's ultra thin as well.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,000
And that it has an ultra fast processor.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
So ultra light, ultra fast, ultra thin.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,320
This is a way of saying very, very.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
That's right.

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
So that's what he's saying.

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,160
He's saying it's very light, it's very thin.

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,440
So that's pretty much the structure.

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,880
You can add ultra before an adjective to emphasize that it's very something.

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
That's right.

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,920
So when I think of cool actors, I think of James Dean.

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,240
He was ultra cool.

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
Ultra cool.

84
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Very cool.

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
That's right.

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Okay.

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,240
So you can do it with pretty much all adjectives, but you can't really exaggerate and use it

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
all the time.

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,960
Well, the key is to remember this is an exaggeration.

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,640
So yeah, you don't want to use it all the time.

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,120
But if you want to make sure you say that something is, if you want to emphasize that

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,840
something is special or that it's very, very something, you use the word ultra.

93
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
That's right.

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Okay.

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,800
As you continue to talk about the characteristics of the laptop computer, he made reference

96
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,600
to the LCD display, the screen of the computer.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
And he said that it's a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,760
What does he mean by crystal clear?

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,200
Well, crystal is a very special kind of glass, right?

100
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,920
And so it's expensive.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,720
It's what some people have as their special glassware, you know, wine glasses and drinking

102
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
glasses.

103
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,280
And so crystal is very special because it's so clear to see through.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
So transparent.

105
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
It's transparent.

106
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Light goes through it.

107
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
You can see everything.

108
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,920
And so to say something is crystal clear is to say that it's very, very clear.

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
It's extremely clear.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,000
It's as clear as crystal.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,640
So basically the screen of this computer, you can see very, very well everything that's

113
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
on the screen, everything that's happening.

114
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,600
All the colors, all of the words.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Okay.

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,560
And then moving away from the characteristics of the computer, he talked about projected

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,240
sales and he expected $20 million.

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,560
But he said that that is a very conservative estimate.

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay.

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,280
So an estimate is like a guess.

121
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,640
It's how much we think we will earn in a year or how much we think will happen.

122
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,080
But in this case, a conservative estimate means that it's a low estimate.

123
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,160
You know, we might make $20 million next year.

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,940
That's conservative.

125
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,560
Another estimate is we will make $40 million.

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
So that's not conservative.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,640
So as you said, an estimate is we are more or less guessing how much it would be.

130
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,180
So what would be the opposite of a conservative estimate?

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,040
You could say a generous estimate.

132
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
That means you're giving a lot.

133
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Okay.

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,640
So a generous estimate is our revenues will be at around $60 million next year.

135
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Okay.

136
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Very good.

137
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
So I think we've taken in a lot.

138
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,900
Why don't we take a break?

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:49,780
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,680
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,460
our previous models?

142
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,600
And also, of course, with some of our competitors.

143
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,700
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

144
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,360
This is a key question and it's something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

145
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

146
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,200
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light

147
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
laptop computers.

148
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,880
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

149
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,480
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

150
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,440
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

151
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
15-inch LCD display.

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,360
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,960
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

155
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,280
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,640
for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

157
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,240
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

158
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of

159
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
this figure at the very least.

160
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

161
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing

162
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

163
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:30,480
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

164
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
Alright we're back with Fluency Builder.

165
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,480
Let's take a look at some key phrases now.

166
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Fluency Builder.

167
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Alright, so our first phrase is a very important phrase when you're trying to differentiate

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,200
different products or things.

169
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,880
We say, this is really a cut above the rest.

170
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Okay, so if something is a cut above the rest, it means that it's in a different category

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
from everyone else.

172
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,760
It's a lot better.

173
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
It is a lot better.

174
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,000
So you can say that we saw many, many applicants who wanted to come for a job at our company,

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800
but John, he was a cut above the rest.

176
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
He was much better than all of the other candidates.

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,060
Okay, very good.

178
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,360
So a cut above the rest.

179
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,440
Now when we talked about this computer, he also made reference saying that it's in a

180
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,960
league of its own.

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,640
The computer is so powerful, it's so new, it's so fantastic that it's in a league of

182
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
its own.

183
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,680
Okay, so a league is like a category in this case.

184
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,380
We have good computers and we have great computers, but this computer is so good.

185
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,680
It's in an entirely new category.

186
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
It's awesome.

187
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,720
It's amazing.

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
It's mind blowing.

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,520
So we often say this with new things.

190
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,200
This is great, but nothing before it can compare.

191
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,520
They're just not as good.

192
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,400
So it's in a league of its own.

193
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,560
Okay, very good.

194
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,240
So you can make reference to products or also people, right?

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,720
A person can be in a league of his own.

196
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
That's right.

197
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,680
So you know, there are a lot of good singers in the world, but this singer, he is in a

198
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,720
league of his own.

199
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,400
Okay, very good.

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,860
And to finish off Fluency Builder, towards the end of his dialogue, he said, to please

201
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,600
bear in mind that this is only the first year of production.

202
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,120
Okay, so we're talking about making these products.

203
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,840
You know, there's going to take time to make money and Mr. Ford would like us to bear

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,640
something in mind, to bear in mind this fact.

205
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,080
So to bear something in mind means to remember or to consider.

206
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Okay, so he's asking us to please consider that it's only the first year of production,

207
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,740
so we can't really expect too much.

208
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
That's right.

209
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,760
So I could talk about a number of different things.

210
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,000
I could say, you know, Marco, here's my report.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please look over it.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
Please bear in mind, this is only a first draft.

213
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,680
Okay, so I will make some edits, I will make some changes.

214
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not perfect and I know that.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
So please bear this in mind.

216
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,860
Okay, so you're kind of warning me, you're kind of letting me know to consider the fact

217
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,880
that it's not the final report and there might be some mistakes.

218
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Exactly.

219
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,440
So to bear in mind that saying this is kind of like a warning that things are not perfect

220
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
yet but, you know, I still want your opinion.

221
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
Okay, very good.

222
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:20,160
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

223
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,040
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with

224
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,960
our previous models and also of course with some of our competitors.

225
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,060
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

226
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,800
This is a key question and it's something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

227
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,720
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

228
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,560
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light

229
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,880
laptop computers.

230
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,240
It is only 2 pounds which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

231
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,840
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

232
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,760
4 gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor, the most advanced video and sound cards on

233
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,520
the market are installed with a crystal clear 15-inch LCD display.

234
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,720
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

235
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,320
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

236
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,640
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue

237
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,000
for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

239
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,240
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,520
this figure at the very least.

241
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,960
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

242
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm certain that in the coming 3 years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing

243
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,720
products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

244
00:12:47,720 --> 00:13:01,120
Ok, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

245
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
We're back.

246
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,720
Now you've probably saw this acronym in the very first part of the dialogue when he said

247
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,720
that the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,000
Alright, so this is a very special acronym for the business world and it stands for U

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,120
– Unique, S – Selling, and P – Point.

250
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Unique Selling Point.

251
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,240
That's right.

252
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,920
So as the name says, a unique selling point are characteristics that are unique to the

253
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,760
machine that allow it to be more competitive and to persuade people to buy it or to sell

254
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
itself.

255
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,160
So the new iPhone has a very interesting unique selling point.

256
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,240
It has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back.

257
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,680
So that really differentiates it from other phones on the market.

258
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
That's right.

259
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,040
So that is what a USP is or a unique selling point.

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,400
As we said, it's an acronym in the business world, but next time that you find the opportunity

261
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,440
to use it, I'm sure it's going to sound amazing.

262
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,920
Yes, very professional.

263
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
USP, Unique Selling Point.

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,760
Alright so that's all the time we have.

265
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,560
Be sure to check out the next part of our series next week and of course if you have

266
