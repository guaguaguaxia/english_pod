00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,760
My name is Catherine and what are we talking about today, Marco?

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,640
Today we are talking about a very interesting topic, most importantly among men who are

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,760
trying to get women's attention.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,280
Okay, so these are some of the things that men might try to say if they are trying to

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,480
find a girlfriend or men if you're out there, things that you might want to say or not want

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
to say in English.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Right, right.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
That's right.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's quickly just take a look at our dialogue.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,720
Let's see what's going on and we'll be back in a bit.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Let's go out tomorrow night.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,160
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,120
I don't think that's a good idea.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,240
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,560
Maybe you just need a few pickup lines, you know, to break the ice.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,480
Pickup lines don't work.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,280
Come on, you can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
What?

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
Come on, that's just lame.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,160
No girl would fall for that.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,920
Fine, then you can say, so there you are.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
That's a good one.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
I think that's pretty funny.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
her a drink.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,360
Okay, how does this sound?

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,480
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,680
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,840
Nice.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Let's go.

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,840
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,160
So now let's explain what's going on a little bit more.

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,280
Let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,640
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,440
So the first word that we have here, Marco, is a verb.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,080
We say to approach or to approach someone.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,800
That's right, to approach someone.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,220
And that means to go up to someone and start a conversation, start talking to them.

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
That's right.

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,680
So you physically walk towards someone, you go to them to start talking to them.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,520
So you can say, I'm not good at approaching other people or he approached her in the bar

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,000
because he wanted to talk to her.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,880
So to approach someone is to go up or get close to that person and start talking to

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
them.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
That's right.

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
All right.

51
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,960
So now what the dialogue focuses on is pickup lines, as the title says.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,120
So what exactly are pickup lines?

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
All right.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, I'll take this as a phrase.

55
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,720
You don't want to look at the individual words, but pickup lines are things that people say

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,600
to show that they are interested romantically in other people.

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,640
So if I am talking to someone and maybe he says something that is a pickup line, he's

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,320
trying to show that he's interested in me.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
That's right.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,280
So usually, I guess, guys use pickup lines at bars or something to get a girl's attention

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
and to, as you say, show that he is interested in her, right?

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
That's right.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
And some are very creative and nice and some are very stupid and silly.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
So there are many different kinds of pickup lines.

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,280
But the trick here is that they're usually lines that the person will create or will

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,800
have heard before they use it.

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Right.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Exactly.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
It's like a fixed thing.

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,960
It is usually very creative, as you say, or very funny to kind of get the girl's attention.

72
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,480
Now, the first pickup line that we heard was, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

73
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,000
If you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All right.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So what does he mean here?

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,320
If you were a booger, what is a booger?

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,200
A booger is a piece of dirt in your nose.

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Okay.

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,840
So sometimes you have some things in your nose and you want to blow your nose to clear

80
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
it.

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Well, those things inside your nose, those are called boogers.

82
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,200
This is very informal English.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Right.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,280
So I guess the technical term for it would be mucus.

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Mucus.

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
That's right.

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,080
But obviously, in English, there's also an informal way of calling it and it's called

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,960
a booger.

89
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,680
So the idea here is the pickup line means two things.

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,920
It means sometimes you have to take boogers out of your nose.

91
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,840
Some people use their finger.

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,560
But the other meaning is, if I'm interested in you, I pick you first.

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,960
And the verb here, to pick, is not to choose, but it's actually used as a verb when you're

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,800
talking about your nose.

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,720
You pick your nose or you pick a booger.

96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,540
That means to actually remove.

97
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,000
It means to put your finger in your nose to take out these pieces of dirt.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Right.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,360
So maybe a mom, a mother to their younger son or daughter would tell them, don't pick

100
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
your nose in public.

101
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Moms often say this in English.

102
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Don't pick your nose.

103
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
It's rude.

104
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Exactly.

105
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
All right.

106
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,240
So it's a very interesting pickup line.

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,580
Obviously very funny and I guess creative.

108
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,880
But at the same time, the verb there, to pick, we just figured out it means something completely

109
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
different.

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
All right.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,640
So it's a joke, but it's also kind of gross.

112
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Exactly.

113
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,640
And obviously his friend agrees and says that's lame.

114
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Lame.

115
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,040
So something is lame if it's stupid or not funny.

116
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,560
We often say that's a really lame joke, which means I don't like that.

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
I don't think it's funny.

118
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Okay.

119
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,320
And actually people start using the word lame for many things that they don't like or they

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
think is not interesting.

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Right.

122
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah.

123
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Like that band is so lame.

124
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,720
Or that movie was lame.

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
It wasn't interesting.

126
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
It wasn't fun.

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Okay.

128
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
So that's basically what it means.

129
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
All right.

130
00:05:50,600 --> 00:06:00,520
So let's take a look at everything we've learned again and we'll be back in a bit.

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Let's go out tomorrow night.

132
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,960
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

133
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I don't think that's a good idea.

134
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,360
Maybe you just need a few pickup lines, you know, to break the ice.

136
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
Pickup lines don't work.

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Come on.

138
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,040
You can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
What?

140
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Come on.

141
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,560
That's just lame.

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
No girl would fall for that.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Fine.

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,720
Then you can say, so there you are.

145
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

146
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
That's a good one.

147
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I think that's pretty funny.

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Yeah.

149
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
You know, you make her laugh.

150
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
You make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.

151
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Okay.

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
How does this sound?

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,320
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

154
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,600
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

155
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,720
Nice.

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Let's go.

157
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,120
All right.

158
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,560
Now, let's take a look at some of these phrases on Fluency Builder.

159
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Okay.

161
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,200
So the first phrase we have here is something very, very common in business as well as in

162
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
social situations.

163
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,800
We say, to break the ice.

164
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
And this is something that we heard when the two boys were talking about approaching a

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
girl.

166
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,480
He said, I don't know how to break the ice.

167
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Right.

168
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,360
So to break the ice is to make an awkward situation or something that's a little bit

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
uncomfortable, a little bit more relaxed.

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
That's right.

171
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,640
So oftentimes in a new company or at a party where you don't know anyone, you have to break

172
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
the ice.

173
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,520
You have to make things more comfortable so you can talk to people.

174
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
That's right.

175
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
All right.

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
So you want to break the ice.

177
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,080
You want to maybe be more comfortable around people.

178
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Right.

179
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,720
So sometimes people use games to break the ice.

180
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Like at your company, maybe your first day of work, they'll have games to learn people's

181
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
names.

182
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,240
These are ways of breaking the ice.

183
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,800
Or at a party, you learn some pickup lines to break the ice with women.

184
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
That's right.

185
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
All right.

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
So we want to break the ice.

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
We want to use some pickup lines.

188
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,200
And his friend argues that pickup lines are kind of lame.

189
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,040
And he even says, no girl would fall for that line.

190
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Okay.

191
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,120
To fall for something.

192
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,680
This is a really important phrase and something that we say often in English.

193
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
Now, what exactly does it mean?

194
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,480
You're not falling on the ground.

195
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
No, no.

196
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,240
You believe it or you consider it to be real.

197
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
All right.

198
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,720
So when something is a lie or it's fake or it's not totally true, but someone believes

199
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,640
it anyway, you say that that person, he fell for it.

200
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Okay.

201
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,040
So if I say, hey, Marco, did you know tomorrow's a holiday?

202
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
We don't have to work.

203
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay.

204
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
And I don't come to work.

205
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Yeah.

206
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,960
I say, oh, Marco fell for my trick.

207
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,240
I mean, he believed it, but I was actually lying.

208
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Exactly.

209
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
All right.

210
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,000
So to fall for something means to believe it or to think it's true.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

212
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,160
So no girl would fall for that means no girl would actually like you because you use these

213
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
silly pickup lines.

214
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
That's right.

215
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
All right.

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
So then he actually used another line.

217
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,560
He said, okay, so maybe you can use this other line.

218
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
And his friend agreed.

219
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Okay.

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,640
That's a good one.

221
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
That's a good one.

222
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
You can also say good one.

223
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Good one.

224
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Yeah.

225
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
This is very informal English.

226
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,560
We say when we want to say that, you know, I like the idea or it's a good, it's a good

227
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
idea.

228
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Or maybe even a joke.

229
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,400
Someone tells a joke and you think it's really funny.

230
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,120
You say, oh, that's a good one.

231
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
That's a good one.

232
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,520
So in this case, we heard one good pickup line and one bad one, but maybe you're at

233
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,240
work and someone comes up with a really good idea for marketing.

234
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
You say, oh, that's a good one.

235
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
That's a good idea.

236
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
That's a good one.

237
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
That's right.

238
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
All right.

239
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,840
And obviously his friend explains that the whole purpose of the pickup line is to make

240
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,280
a fool of yourself a little bit and then, you know, buy the girl a drink or become her

241
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
friend.

242
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Okay.

243
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
To make a fool of yourself.

244
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,000
Now, this is something that is probably not a good thing in most cases, right?

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,440
A fool is someone who is silly, who no one takes seriously.

246
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Right.

247
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Okay.

248
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,940
Someone who's not, yeah, not very serious.

249
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,320
So to make a fool of yourself is to embarrass yourself a little bit.

250
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Yeah.

251
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,620
To look stupid in front of other people.

252
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,720
So I can say, oh, on my first day of work, I tripped and I fell on the ground and I made

253
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,760
a fool of myself in front of my new colleagues.

254
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
That's right.

255
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,620
So that's basically what it means to make a fool of yourself, to embarrass yourself,

256
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,520
but you're doing it to yourself.

257
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,040
It's not that someone else is embarrassing you.

258
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
You are embarrassing yourself.

259
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
That's right.

260
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
All right.

261
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:49,680
Let's try that dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

262
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Let's go out tomorrow night.

263
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,120
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

264
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
I don't think that's a good idea.

265
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,220
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

266
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,520
Maybe you just need a few pickup lines, you know, to break the ice.

267
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,480
Pickup lines don't work.

268
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Come on.

269
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,440
You can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

270
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
What?

271
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,920
Come on.

272
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
That's just lame.

273
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,240
No girl would fall for that.

274
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Fine.

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
Then you can say, so there you are.

276
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

277
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
That's a good one.

278
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I think that's pretty funny.

279
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Yeah.

280
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
So you make her laugh.

281
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,960
You make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.

282
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Okay.

283
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
How does this sound?

284
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

285
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,760
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

286
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
Nice.

287
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Let's go.

288
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
All right.

289
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,800
So looking at these pickup lines, we took a look at the first one about the booger and

290
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
everything.

291
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,280
What about the second one when you say, so there you are.

292
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,000
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
So what is he saying here?

294
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
What is it?

295
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
What is implied?

296
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,760
He's basically saying that he's met her before and he's been looking for her.

297
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,060
So where did he meet her?

298
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,080
He says he met her in his dreams, but now, oh, there she is.

299
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,600
I was looking for you.

300
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,800
You, you're the woman of my dreams.

301
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Right.

302
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,400
So obviously the girl can feel a little bit confused at first because, oh, why were you

303
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
looking for me?

304
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,960
And then he says, oh, because you are the woman of my dreams.

305
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,920
So it's obviously a little bit exaggerating, but it's funny.

306
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,920
He's joking, but he's basically saying, you know, I know you, I've been looking for you.

307
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,640
And what about our last, uh, pickup line where he was saying, I was so enchanted by your

308
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,640
beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

309
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,480
So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

310
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,760
So he's saying, you're so beautiful that I had this accident.

311
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,360
I walked into a wall, I hit my face.

312
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,640
Now that I have an injury, I need your information so that I can claim insurance so I can get

313
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,240
money from my insurance company.

314
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,440
So this is a way to ask a woman for her phone number and name.

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Her name.

316
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Exactly.

317
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,560
So it's a very clever way of, uh, of, of, of obviously breaking the ice, but at the

318
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,280
same time, he's trying to be funny and trying to get her number, her telephone number and

319
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
her name.

320
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
That's right.

321
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,360
So one of the most memorable ones that I've heard was, uh, was your father a thief because

322
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,840
he stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes.

323
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
Ah, nice.

324
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
So, uh, this one is more of a compliment.

325
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,360
Yes, it's a compliment.

326
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,360
And uh, but in a funny way saying, oh, your dad stole all the stars from the sky.

327
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,760
Yeah, no, I've heard a number of them.

328
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,480
Most of them are pretty bad, pretty lame.

329
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,040
Um, and they're always a, a way to almost always a way to ask for your phone number.

330
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,600
Now as a girl, what do you think is better for a guy to use a clever, funny, but tasteful

331
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,880
pickup line or to just walk up to you and say, hi, my name is so and so.

332
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,600
You know, what's your name?

333
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,160
If you can be clever, if you can come up with something that's funny or interesting, then

334
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
I think it's good.

335
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,120
If you say something that's rude or disgusting, I think that's probably bad.

336
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
Like the booger, the booger pickup line is a bad idea.

337
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,120
That's an example of a bad pickup line.

338
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,040
But you know, if you can laugh about it, not, you don't say it seriously, but if you can

339
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,720
laugh about it and say, hey, you know, is your daddy a thief?

340
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,080
It's something to start the conversation if you're laughing.

341
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Right.

342
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,280
Because sometimes it's very awkward if someone says, hey, I'm John, you know, what's your

343
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
name?

344
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Right.

345
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
You don't really know how to react to that.

346
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
It's a little boring.

347
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,000
And, and approaching someone like that way can be a little bit difficult.

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,240
