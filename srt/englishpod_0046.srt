00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello everyone, welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,620
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,600
And today we're going to be talking about an ER, an emergency room.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Exactly, we're bringing you our very own ER drama here at EnglishPod.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,720
Yeah, doctor shows are very popular with people, medical terms and all that stuff.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,640
Yeah, so we're going to teach you some words that you might hear commonly in medical shows

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,800
on TV or in movies.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
This is really common language in television.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,160
Or even at a hospital, right?

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,320
Well yeah, but let's hope our listeners don't have to face this.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Okay, so let's preview some words in Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,760
Alright, so what's our first word?

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,200
Okay, the first word is CPR.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
CPR.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
CPR.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,480
So, that's pretty easy, what does that mean?

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,840
Well, it's short for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Okay.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
If that means anything to you.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,640
Well cardio is related to the heart.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,440
Cardio refers to the lungs.

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Yep.

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,760
Resuscitation means to come back to life.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,240
Yes, so basically CPR is, you know when someone stops breathing, you put your mouth on their

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,120
mouth and you breathe inside their lungs.

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,640
Okay, to give them air.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Yeah.

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Okay.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
So, CPR.

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
That's CPR.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,720
Okay, so let's take a look at our next word, BP.

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
BP.

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,480
So, BP is short for?

36
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Blood pressure.

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Blood pressure.

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,000
That's just the way that doctors use it in the emergency room.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Exactly, pretty simple.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
Okay, so blood pressure.

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,080
And our last word, acute respiratory failure.

42
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,320
Acute respiratory failure.

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,160
So, what is that exactly?

44
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,760
That sounds complicated.

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,480
Basically it's really serious, they stop breathing.

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
You stop breathing.

47
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Yeah.

48
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Okay.

49
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,840
So, if you go into acute respiratory failure, then the doctor or somebody has to perform

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
CPR.

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Right.

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
All right, cool.

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Okay, so we've previewed these three great words, now let's listen to our dialogue for

54
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
the first time.

55
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,960
It's going to be really fast and you're going to have a lot of drama in it, so don't worry

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,040
if you don't understand everything.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah, we're going to come back and teach you some of the important language.

58
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Help!

59
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Are you a doctor?

60
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:26,520
My poor little Frankie, he's just stopped breathing.

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Oh my gosh, help me.

62
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,360
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Oh, Frankie.

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,520
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

65
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,320
Somebody page Dr. Hauser.

66
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,480
Get the patient to hold still.

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
I can't get a pulse.

68
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Okay, he's on the monitor.

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,640
His BP is falling.

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
He's flatlining.

71
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
No, Frankie!

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,160
Doctor, do something!

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,600
Someone get her out of here.

74
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Get me the defibrillator.

75
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Okay, clear.

76
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Again, clear.

77
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

78
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Clear.

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I got a pulse.

80
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay, what's happening?

81
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
The patient is in acute respiratory failure.

82
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I think we're going to have to intubate.

83
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
All right, we're going to have to intubate.

84
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

85
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Okay, we're going to have to intubate.

86
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

87
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

88
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

89
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

90
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

91
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

92
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm going to have to intubate.

93
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm going to have to intubiate.

94
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Don't worry, he's not dying.

95
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
All right, tube's in.

96
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Bag him.

97
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

98
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Let's go!

99
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
People, move!

100
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Move!

101
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Doctor, oh thank God!

102
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
How is he?

103
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:34,040
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

104
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,360
He's still in critical condition.

105
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,840
We're moving him to intensive care, but-

106
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,480
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

107
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,020
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

108
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,280
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

109
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,100
Wow, so much drama over a little hamster.

110
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,940
Yeah, a little pet, hey?

111
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,960
A little pet, a little hamster.

112
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,060
Well, you know what?

113
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,020
I can relate to this owner

114
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,540
and I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about that later.

115
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,500
Yeah, I know you have a really good story about this.

116
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,780
Yeah, but in the meantime,

117
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,580
let's look at some great language in Language Takeaway.

118
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,540
All right, so let's take a look at our first word,

119
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,380
intubate.

120
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,500
Intubate.

121
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Intubate.

122
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,860
Intubate.

123
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,560
So this is a medical procedure.

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,940
Exactly.

125
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,380
When a patient can't breathe properly,

126
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,820
sometimes the doctor takes a long tube

127
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,660
and puts it into their mouth and down their pipes,

128
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,140
I guess, down their breathing tube.

129
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,980
Right.

130
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,020
So that they can breathe better.

131
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,300
Okay, so that's to intubate.

132
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,140
Yes.

133
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,540
Okay, so once they've intubated the patient,

134
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,180
they start to bag him.

135
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah, bag him.

136
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,340
Bag him.

137
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,160
Bag him.

138
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,220
Does that mean they like put a bag

139
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,060
over the person's head or something?

140
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,300
No, no, no, no, no.

141
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,340
So there's a bag attached to this intubation tube

142
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,140
and you squeeze it to put air into the lungs.

143
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,460
Okay, so you squeeze this bag

144
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,580
and it puts air through the tube.

145
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,700
I think this is just medical slang.

146
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
Yeah, I guess bag him.

147
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah, but you hear it all the time on TV,

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,420
so it's important our listeners know it.

149
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,860
Okay, let's look at our next word, critical condition.

150
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,100
Critical condition.

151
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,500
Critical condition.

152
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,980
The patient's in critical condition.

153
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,940
This condition means it's serious.

154
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,120
Right, if a patient is in critical condition,

155
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,380
they're either really, really hurt or really, really sick

156
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,140
and they could die pretty soon.

157
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,260
Okay, so you don't want to be in critical condition.

158
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,140
No.

159
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,780
Let's take a look at our next word, stabilize.

160
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,860
Stabilize.

161
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,980
Stabilize.

162
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,140
Stabilize.

163
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140
So when the doctors stabilize a patient,

164
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,340
they take that patient out of danger.

165
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,540
Exactly, when a patient is stabilized,

166
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,940
they probably won't die in five minutes.

167
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,780
Okay.

168
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,020
But they could still be really sick.

169
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,980
They could be in critical condition, right?

170
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,140
But it's under control.

171
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Exactly.

172
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,800
Okay.

173
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Yeah.

174
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,460
Stabilize.

175
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,820
Let's look at our last word, ICU.

176
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,940
ICU.

177
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,100
ICU.

178
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,500
Intensive care unit.

179
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,540
Okay, that's what it means, intensive care unit.

180
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,380
Yep.

181
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,260
So this is a place where patients

182
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,780
who are in critical condition are taken.

183
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,700
Right.

184
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,700
So what's the difference between an ICU and a regular room?

185
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,060
Well, I don't know, I've never been in one.

186
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,540
But I think like patients are monitored regularly

187
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
and I think there's, you know, maybe more,

188
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,220
maybe there are more nurses and fewer patients.

189
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,980
There's just a higher level of care.

190
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,100
A higher level of care.

191
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,940
Yeah.

192
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay.

193
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,380
Okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

194
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,180
Now, try to catch all of these medical terms

195
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,340
that we've just talked about,

196
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,540
and then we'll come back and explain a few phrases.

197
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,780
♪♪

198
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,740
Help!

199
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,260
Are you a doctor?

200
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,780
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

201
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,580
Oh my gosh, help me.

202
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,340
I tried to perform CPR, but I just,

203
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,260
I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

204
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
Oh, Frankie.

205
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,580
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

206
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Somebody page Dr. Hauser.

207
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,500
Get the patient to hold still.

208
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,760
I can't get a pulse.

209
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,420
Okay, he's on the monitor.

210
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,780
His BP's falling.

211
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,820
He's flatlining.

212
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,900
No, Frankie!

213
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,460
Doctor, do something!

214
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,620
Someone get her out of here.

215
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,380
Get me the defibrillator.

216
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,220
Okay, clear.

217
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,580
Again, clear.

218
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,660
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

219
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,500
Clear!

220
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,020
I've got a pulse.

221
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,500
Okay, what's happening?

222
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,420
The patient is in acute respiratory failure.

223
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,580
I think we're going to have to intubate.

224
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,020
All right, tube's in.

225
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,860
Bag him.

226
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,020
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

227
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,420
Let's go, people, move, move!

228
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,660
Doctor, oh, thank God.

229
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,380
How is he?

230
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
We've managed to stabilize Frankie,

231
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,580
but he's not out of the woods yet.

232
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,860
He's still in critical condition.

233
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,940
We're moving him to intensive care, but-

234
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,180
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

235
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,700
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

236
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,980
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

237
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,060
Okay, so there are some really good phrasal verbs

238
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,900
in this dialogue.

239
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,460
Yeah, a couple of good phrasal verbs.

240
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,700
Okay, so let's take a look at these phrasal verbs

241
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,940
in putting it together.

242
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,900
Putting it together.

243
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,420
All right, so what's our first phrasal verb today?

244
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Hook up.

245
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,260
Hook up.

246
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,580
Hook up.

247
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,060
So to hook up.

248
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,180
So when we talk about hooking something up,

249
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,700
we are usually talking about something that's

250
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,420
we are usually talking about electronics, right Marco?

251
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,620
Yeah, you usually hook up your TV or your computer.

252
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,140
So why don't we listen to some examples

253
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,900
of how we would use hook up.

254
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,140
Example one.

255
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,620
I finally got a Nintendo Wii.

256
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,900
Come on, help me hook it up to the TV.

257
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Example two.

258
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,660
I don't know how to hook up this new DVD player.

259
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,740
Can you help me?

260
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,420
Example three.

261
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,100
I just hooked up my new HDTV.

262
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Wanna come over and watch a movie?

263
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,180
Great, so you can see that there are a few different

264
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,820
variations of this pattern here with the word hook up

265
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,100
because it's a phrasal verb.

266
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,980
Exactly.

267
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,860
And I think the same patterns can apply

268
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,380
to our next phrasal verb.

269
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,340
Hold still.

270
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,420
Hold still.

271
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,740
Hold still.

272
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,940
Hold still.

273
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,700
So the doctor needed the patient to hold still.

274
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,140
Right, to stop moving.

275
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,020
Stop moving, exactly.

276
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,660
Okay, let's listen to some more examples of hold still

277
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,780
because again, it's a really great phrasal verb

278
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,580
that you can change up a little bit.

279
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,380
Example one.

280
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,380
If you don't hold still,

281
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,380
I can't see if you have something in your eye.

282
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,780
Example two.

283
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
Hold still while she cuts your hair

284
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,340
or else she might make a mistake.

285
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,860
Example three.

286
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Hold still, you have a bee on your back.

287
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,420
Okay, hold still, great word.

288
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,620
Yep.

289
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,460
All right, one final phrase for you.

290
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,020
Out of the woods.

291
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,620
Out of the woods.

292
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Out of the woods.

293
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,060
Out of the woods.

294
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,100
So when someone's out of the woods, they're...

295
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Free from danger.

296
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,940
Uh-huh, safe.

297
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,260
Okay, safe.

298
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,740
I guess it's kind of a saying.

299
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,580
Yeah.

300
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,780
Like I'm out of the woods, I'm free, I'm safe.

301
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,660
I guess there are two variants of this phrase.

302
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,380
We can say, I'm out of the woods or we're out of the woods

303
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,820
or I guess we're not out of the woods yet.

304
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,260
Uh-huh, so, okay.

305
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,980
Out of the woods.

306
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,300
Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue

307
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,900
again and when we come back,

308
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,860
Erica's gonna tell us about her ER story.

309
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,020
Help, are you a doctor?

310
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,500
My poor little Frankie, he's just stopped breathing.

311
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,340
Oh my gosh, help me.

312
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,940
I tried to perform CPR, but I just,

313
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,060
I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

314
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,100
Oh, Frankie.

315
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,300
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

316
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,180
Somebody page Dr. Hauser.

317
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Get the patient to hold still.

318
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,540
I can't get a pulse.

319
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

320
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

321
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

322
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

323
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,140
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

324
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

325
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,780
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

326
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,860
I can't get a pulse.

327
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,420
Okay, he's on the monitor.

328
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,820
His BP's falling.

329
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,860
He's flatlining.

330
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,660
No, Frankie!

331
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,140
Doctor, do something!

332
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,740
Someone get her out of here.

333
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,500
Get me the defibrillator.

334
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,420
Okay, clear.

335
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,780
Again, clear.

336
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,740
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

337
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,940
Clear.

338
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,100
I got a pulse.

339
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,660
Okay, what's happening?

340
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,500
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

341
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,660
I think we're going to have to intubate.

342
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,100
Alright, tube's in.

343
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Bag him.

344
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

345
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:18,980
Let's go, people, move, move!

346
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,260
Doctor, oh thank God!

347
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,980
How is he?

348
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,020
We've managed to stabilize Frankie,

349
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,220
but he's not out of the woods yet.

350
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,460
He's still in critical condition.

351
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,540
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

352
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,780
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

353
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,340
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

354
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:45,940
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

355
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Okay, Erica, so what happened?

356
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,740
What emergency did you have?

357
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,020
Well, it was with my cat.

358
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,660
Your cat.

359
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,780
Yes, I had some people over for dinner,

360
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,700
and it was maybe 1.30 in the morning,

361
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,980
and I went downstairs to let them out

362
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,380
and show them where the taxis were,

363
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,020
and then I came up and I saw that the cat was gone,

364
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,300
and it turned out that the cat fell out of the window.

365
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,540
Fell out of the window.

366
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,260
Yeah.

367
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,540
Alright, but our listeners have to know,

368
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,780
what story or what floor do you live on?

369
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,740
The 20th floor.

370
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,580
The 20th.

371
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,900
Yeah, so this is really dangerous, right?

372
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,180
That's really high up.

373
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,340
So I went outside and I was calling for my cat,

374
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,260
and I was like, Mr. Finn, where are you?

375
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,340
How did you know he fell out?

376
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,140
I just knew.

377
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,540
Yeah?

378
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:24,900
Yeah.

379
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Mother's instinct.

380
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,020
I guess so.

381
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,660
So he was calling back to me, and so I picked him up

382
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,860
and brought him to the house,

383
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,700
and we had to bring him to the vet,

384
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,180
and it was 2.30, 3 in the morning at this time,

385
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,860
and the vet was not very happy that we woke him up out of bed.

386
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,820
But that was a really good emergency, though.

387
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,540
Yeah.

388
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,820
So anyway, we brought him to the vet.

389
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,940
He was in critical condition for a couple of days,

390
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,820
and then we had to keep him in the vet's ICU for about a week.

391
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,020
He broke his back.

392
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,620
He broke two of his legs.

393
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,420
Wow.

394
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,020
Yeah, and so he was in the hospital for three weeks

395
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,620
and then at home on bed rest for another three weeks.

396
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,540
But now he's good as new.

397
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,260
Good as new.

398
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,740
Yeah.

399
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,300
He used up one of his seven lives.

400
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,780
Nine lives.

401
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,180
Nine?

402
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,540
Nine.

403
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,340
Yeah.

404
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,300
I think maybe eight of his nine lives.

405
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,460
He's only got one left.

406
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah.

407
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,380
Wow, that's an interesting story.

408
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,300
I guess that's the inspiration under this dialogue.

409
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,180
Exactly.

410
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,980
Sometimes we Anglos really treat our cats

411
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,380
and our hamsters and our dogs like they're our children.

412
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,100
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,220
No, that's good.

414
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,340
Well, I'm glad Mr. Finn is OK and he's

415
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,540
walking and good as new.

416
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,500
Yep, good as new.

417
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,940
So maybe our users have some stories about their pets

418
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,340
being taken to the hospital.

419
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,140
I want to hear.

420
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,500
Yeah, that should be interesting.

421
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,260
I've never had a pet actually break a leg or anything,

422
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,500
so don't have any pet stories this time.

423
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,100
But we want to hear what you think,

424
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,860
so come to EnglishPod.com, leave all your questions

425
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,340
and comments and your stories.

426
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,060
Yes.

427
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,540
And we'll be there to answer them.

428
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,780
So guys, thanks for listening.

429
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,980
And until next time, goodbye.

430
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:24,540
Bye.
