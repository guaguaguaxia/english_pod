00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,960
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson for you.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,560
It's kind of about cars, right?

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
That's right.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,600
So today we are taking our car to the mechanic and we're just going to check things and make

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,920
sure that our car is okay.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
All right.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,680
So we're going to learn a lot of really great words that have to do with cars and what happens

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,000
when cars break down.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So let's listen to our dialogue.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,520
Welcome to Al's Garage.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,280
What seems to be the problem?

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,480
No problem at all.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,240
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,840
Very wise decision.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
When was the last time you had a tune-up?

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Not that long ago.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,480
I think it was four months ago.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,440
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Why?

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,720
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,940
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,440
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,280
have to change the pistons and intake valves.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,840
I see.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,960
What else?

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,480
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,320
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Okay.

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,600
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Trust me.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,320
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,240
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,920
So a very simple dialogue with the mechanic explaining to the client about why you need

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,720
to take care of your car.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,560
So he mentioned a couple of very technical words in here.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,720
Let's take a look at those on Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,360
Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,640
The first phrase we're looking at today is tune-up.

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,040
So a tune-up is a thing, it's a noun, and it's something you do to check your car.

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Right.

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,520
So you take your car for a tune-up or you get a tune-up.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,200
Now this is for your car and this basically means to check that your car is okay and replace

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,840
any very easy things around the car.

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,060
So you don't normally get a tune-up when your car is broken.

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,160
You get a tune-up when your car is okay.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
That's right.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,640
So the mechanic explained some of the things that you do when you get a tune-up.

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,520
So for example, he said that they change the motor oil.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Okay, so like it sounds, motor oil is oil for your motor.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
That's right.

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,400
And there are other kinds of oil as well and oil is oftentimes put into the car and then

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
sometimes it falls out.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
And so what's that thing that catches the oil when it comes down?

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
It's called an oil pan.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,760
So yes, as you said, there are different types of oils.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,480
Cooking oil is obviously for cooking, for eating.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,800
But motor oil is not for eating, it's for your motor.

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,540
But we also have to change the oil filter.

61
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,280
Now this is an important part that often gets mentioned at tune-ups.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
That's right.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,600
So the word filter here, you have the verb to filter.

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,340
In this case, we also have a noun, it's called a filter.

65
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,000
So what this device does, it collects maybe dirt or rocks and dust or anything that you

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,320
don't want to be in your engine and specifically maybe if the oil is a little bit dirty.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,720
Right, so an oil filter makes sure that the oil in your motor is not going to harm your

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,320
motor.

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,040
And we also have a couple of interesting things like the fuel filter.

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,640
Now how is this different from the oil filter?

71
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,280
It's pretty much the same thing.

72
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,760
The only difference is that this filter specifically cleans the gasoline in your car.

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, similar object.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
After that, we have something very different.

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,460
These are spark plugs.

76
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
That's right.

77
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,480
These are small little devices that, as the name says, create a spark.

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
This is how your engine goes.

79
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
This is how your car moves.

80
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,160
You have a spark and then everything starts running.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
Spark plugs are actually quite important, right?

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
That's right.

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,320
So a spark is a very quick flash of light that comes out.

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
That's right.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
It's not a long light.

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
It's just a spark.

87
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,720
So maybe when I strike a match or I use a lighter, there's a spark and that's what starts

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
the fire.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
That's right.

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
That's exactly right.

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,520
So a spark plug.

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,440
And now we also check the oil levels of our car and that's a very important thing as well.

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Yeah, that's right.

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,760
So the oil level is something that you test with a long stick and you put it into the

95
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,180
engine, the oil container, and make sure that there is enough oil because if there's not

96
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,560
enough oil, you can have very serious car trouble.

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
That's right.

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,680
So a lot of technical or mechanical things that we're taking a look at.

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:11,160
Why don't we go back, let's review all these words and we'll be back in a bit.

100
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,720
Welcome to Al's Garage.

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,480
What seems to be the problem?

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
No problem at all.

103
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Very wise decision.

105
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,000
When was the last time you had a tune-up?

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
Not that long ago.

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
I think it was four months ago.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,760
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

109
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Why?

110
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,880
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

111
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,100
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

112
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,600
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,440
have to change the pistons and intake valves.

114
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,000
I see.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
What else?

116
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,640
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,680
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Okay.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

120
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Trust me.

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.

122
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,440
All right, we're back.

123
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
So now we've prepared three key phrases for you.

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,600
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

125
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,360
Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,760
This first phrase is something that you often hear in the service industry.

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,200
So anytime you're going to a shop or maybe in this case, the mechanic, the mechanic will

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,980
say to you, what seems to be the problem?

129
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
That's right.

130
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,080
So this is a question and we're saying, what is wrong with your car?

131
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,760
Or maybe if you go to the doctor, the doctor will say, what seems to be the problem?

132
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
What seems to be the problem?

133
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
So this means what's wrong with you?

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,160
Where do you have a problem?

135
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,640
This is a very, very common phrase.

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
So remember this one.

137
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,040
It just means what's going on?

138
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Why are you here?

139
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
What can I help you with?

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,640
It's very polite though, right?

141
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,280
It's better than saying what's wrong with you.

142
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
No, yeah.

143
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
You wouldn't want to say what's wrong with you.

144
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
That's very rude.

145
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,960
So what seems to be the problem is a much more polite way of saying things.

146
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Very good.

147
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,680
And well, the mechanic, after explaining everything, he said that, you know, doing all these things,

148
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,320
changing the filters will keep the car running smoothly.

149
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Okay.

150
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,360
So we're not talking about running like a marathon here.

151
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,200
We're talking about using your car.

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,240
And so when we turn a car on, we don't say that the car is operating.

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
Really, we say it's running.

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,400
So that means that it's in use, that I've turned the key and the motor is running.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,360
But if it's running well, we say it's running smoothly.

156
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,280
So it's not having any problems.

157
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Yeah.

158
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,520
So if you turn your car on and you hear your engine, it sounds very normal, no problems.

159
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,240
It's running smoothly.

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,040
If it's going, it's not running smoothly.

161
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
That's right.

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,320
And obviously, if you don't take care of your car, what may happen is you may suffer a breakdown.

163
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Okay.

164
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Remember this phrase as a phrase, because obviously things can break.

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
You know, I broke a glass.

166
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,280
But as far as cars are concerned, you say, you know, a car breaks down or I want to avoid

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
breakdowns.

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,680
And so this is something that happens when your car no longer works properly.

169
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
That's right.

170
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,560
So you say, my car broke down yesterday.

171
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,720
And I had to call a friend to pick me up because you know, when your car breaks down, you can't

172
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
go anywhere.

173
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
You can't drive it anymore.

174
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Very good.

175
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,440
So to break down now, obviously, if you get a flat tire, that doesn't really mean that

176
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,920
your car broke down.

177
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
No, a flat tire is a bit different.

178
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,680
That means that you have to replace the tire.

179
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,880
But when your car breaks down, it means that something inside the car, like a piece of

180
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,560
it, yeah, the transmission or the spark plugs or the engine, some part of it isn't working

181
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,480
right and you have to get it fixed or replaced.

182
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
That's right.

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,640
Okay, so a lot of interesting things talking about cars here.

184
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,840
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue again.

185
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:09,680
Let's listen to it and be back in a bit.

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
Welcome to Al's Garage.

187
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,000
What seems to be the problem?

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
No problem at all.

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,000
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Very wise decision.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
When was the last time you had a tune-up?

192
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,920
Not that long ago.

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
I think it was four months ago.

194
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,280
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

195
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Why?

196
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,440
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

197
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,640
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

198
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,140
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably

199
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,000
have to change the pistons and intake valves.

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,560
I see.

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
What else?

202
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,200
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

203
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,160
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

204
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Okay, well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

205
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Trust me.

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,560
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.

207
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,880
Okay, so talking about cars and tune-ups.

208
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,640
Now, when we go to the mechanic, you saw that he said, welcome to Al's Garage.

209
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,720
So a mechanic shop is usually called a garage.

210
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
That's right.

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,920
And as you will know, a garage is a place where we store cars.

212
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
So sometimes people park their cars in the street.

213
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,480
But if you have a special place to protect your car from the rain or the snow, like a

214
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,280
room for your car, that's called a garage.

215
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,760
And this might be confusing, but a store, like you say, for a mechanic is a garage also

216
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,520
because there's a door that opens up the same way.

217
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,080
It opens up, not out.

218
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,300
And you pull the car inside and then the mechanic can fix the car.

219
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,400
And so I think that's why it's a garage.

220
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,120
There's room for many cars inside.

221
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
That's right.

222
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,920
So you take, or if your car is at the mechanic shop, you would say, oh, my car is at the

223
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
garage.

224
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
It's getting fixed.

225
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah, that's right.

226
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
But it's a little bit different from the place where you would buy a car.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,840
A place where you buy a car is a car lot, L-O-T, lot.

228
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,720
And that's a place where they have many, many cars outside, like in a big parking lot.

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,120
That's what we call a lot.

230
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,080
And you can pick a car and buy it and test it.

231
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,400
But a place where you fix a car, not special, that's called a garage or a repair shop.

232
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,000
Now, something that's very interesting and very common in places like the States and

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,920
Canada is that there are actually used car lots where you can see many cars that are

234
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,320
used and they're trying to sell.

235
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,880
But obviously in many other countries, it's not very common to see a used car lot.

236
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,360
Well, I think in America, people like to buy new cars and that means that every couple

237
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,600
of years, they sell their old car.

238
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
But that car is still good.

239
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,480
You can still use a car from 2005.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,180
In fact, when I had a car, it was from 1991.

241
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,620
It was 16 years old at the time.

242
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,160
And so I could still drive it.

243
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
It was a good car.

244
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,080
And I think that as long as you can drive it, you can sell it.

245
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,160
This is actually another interesting thing about cars in general in places like this

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
is that there are so many cars.

247
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,440
And as you say, people are often buying new cars every year or trading their cars every

248
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,080
five years, let's say.

249
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,960
Used cars are very, very, very inexpensive.

250
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,120
I mean, you can get a car for like $500 sometimes.

251
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
That's right.

252
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,520
And in a lot of cases, it doesn't make sense to buy a new car because it's going to be

253
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,200
less valuable in one day.

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,640
But a used car, as long as it doesn't have any problems, like you don't want to buy a

255
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,120
car that has faulty spark plugs or whatever.

256
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,720
But as long as it runs smoothly, I think that it's a very good investment to buy a used

257
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
car.

258
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Very good.

259
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
So it's interesting because in many countries, used cars are actually not that much cheaper.

260
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,640
So why don't you come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

261
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,120
Let us know if taking your car to the mechanic is very expensive or buying a used car is

262
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,800
still relatively expensive.

263
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
We hope to see you guys there and until next time.

264
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Bye.

265
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:28,980
Tip your car wastes to reuse an old car.
