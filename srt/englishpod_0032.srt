00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,840
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,760
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about being at the bank.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
That's right.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,100
We've got an intermediate lesson for you today with lots of great language to help you open

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,100
a bank account.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,600
Okay, so let's look at our vocabulary preview today.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,200
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,720
Two words today.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,360
The first one is checking account.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,040
A checking account.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,640
Checking account.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,920
So what is a checking account?

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,560
Well, it's a type of bank account that lets you do your day-to-day or daily banking.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,840
So it's the normal bank account that you use to go shopping, that you use to pay your bills.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Yep, exactly.

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,200
The opposite, and our second word is...

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Savings account.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,520
A savings account.

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,740
Savings account.

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,960
So a savings account is to...

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,040
It's a bank account where you save your money.

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
To save money, right?

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,440
So usually you don't touch the money in this account.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Yeah, usually it stays in there.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Right.

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,200
So usually banks will have these two types of accounts.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Yes.

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Checking and savings.

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Okay, great.

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's listen to our dialogue a first time now.

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Right.

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,880
Well, today we're at a bank and we're going to listen as a man is opening a bank account.

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,360
The dialogue is going to be spoken at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit fast.

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Yeah.

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,880
But don't worry about it because we'll come back and explain everything.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,160
Next, please.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,640
May I help you, sir?

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Hello.

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Yes, I'd like to open a bank account.

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Certainly.

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,520
I can help you with that.

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
What type of account would you like to open?

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,480
A checking or a saving account?

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
What features do they offer?

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,640
Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our checking account, you can have unlimited

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,320
daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,760
rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

50
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
I see.

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,120
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,280
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
All right, then.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,360
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Will you require overdraft protection?

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
There is an extra fee for that.

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
No, that won't be necessary.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,960
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:33,560
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,280
If you could just sign here, and here, and here, we'll be all set.

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
Would you like to make a deposit today?

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,560
Yes, I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,120
$1 billion!

64
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:03,440
All right, $1 billion.

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
That's a lot of money.

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
That's a weird laugh.

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, let's look at language takeaway today.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Language takeaway.

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,320
Today we've got four words for you in language takeaway, all about money and banking.

70
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,480
Money and banking.

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,240
The first one that we have today is transaction.

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Transaction.

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Transaction.

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,080
A transaction.

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,120
So we have some great examples that will help you understand what a transaction is, so let's

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
listen.

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Example one.

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,400
I need a record of my most recent bank transactions.

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,680
Example two.

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,680
There is no fee for bank transactions done online.

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,840
Example three.

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Okay, we've deposited your money.

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,640
Would you like to make another transaction today?

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,680
So basically I can understand that a transaction is moving money around in your bank account.

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,800
Right, it's taking your money from your bank account and putting it in another account

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,680
or just taking it to spend, whatever.

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Yes.

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
That's a transaction.

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,320
Or even putting money into your bank account.

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,120
That's also a transaction.

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Great.

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Our second word, balance.

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Balance.

94
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Balance.

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Balance.

96
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,040
So your account balance is how much money you have.

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Exactly.

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Right?

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
An account balance.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
My account balance is $2 right now, I think.

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
That's a bit of a problem.

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Yes.

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,640
Good thing payday is three days away.

104
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,520
Yeah, oh my God.

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay, our third word, overdraft.

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Overdraft.

107
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Overdraft.

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Overdraft.

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,280
So, this really comes in handy, right?

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,380
To overdraft, can you tell us a little bit about it?

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,280
Let's say in my bank account, I have $500, but I spend $600.

112
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Right.

113
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,720
So, I have an overdraft in my account, meaning I owe the bank $100.

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,960
Right.

115
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,360
It's also commonly referred to as a negative balance.

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
That's right.

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Right?

118
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Negative balance.

119
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Like me.

120
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,640
Very soon, I will have a negative balance.

121
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay, I think this one is a little bit tricky to understand.

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,560
So let's listen to a couple of examples of how we use this word.

123
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,760
Example one.

124
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:42,520
The maximum overdraft on my account is only $5,000.

125
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Example two.

126
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,240
I'm sorry, sir, but you've exceeded your maximum overdraft limit.

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,120
I cannot give you any more money.

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,440
Example three.

129
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Oh no, I have to pay $1,500 in overdraft fees.

130
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, great examples.

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Now we can take a look at our last word, debit card.

132
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
Debit card.

133
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Debit card.

134
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
D-E-B-I-T, card.

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Debit card.

136
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,400
So, a debit card is issued by the bank.

137
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Yes.

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
And used to...

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,080
To get money out of an ATM.

140
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
From an ATM machine, right?

141
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Right.

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
A debit card.

143
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
Not to be confused with a credit card.

144
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Not the same thing.

145
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Okay.

146
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Okay, great.

147
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,280
So, now we could listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed.

148
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
So now we can...

149
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:55,920
We can hear all of the great language you just talked about.

150
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Next please.

151
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,480
May I help you, sir?

152
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Hello.

153
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,560
Yes, I'd like to open a bank account.

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Certainly.

155
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,080
I can help you with that.

156
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,360
What type of account would you like to open?

157
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,160
A checking or a savings account?

158
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,480
What features do they offer?

159
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Well, if you just look here...

160
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,560
See, with our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly

161
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
fee.

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,040
And our savings account has a higher interest rate.

163
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,320
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

164
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I see.

165
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,720
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

166
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
I like to have easy access to my money.

167
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
All right then.

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,840
With this checking account, you'll be issued with a debit card and a checkbook.

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
Will you require overdraft protection?

170
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,760
There is an extra fee for that.

171
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,040
No, that won't be necessary.

172
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,240
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

173
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,600
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

174
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,680
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Would you like to make a deposit today?

176
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes, I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

177
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,400
We heard some interesting phrases of how to tell somebody to do something in a polite

178
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
way.

179
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Yes.

180
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,920
Let's start with Fluency Builder and explain these words.

181
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,560
Fluency Builder.

182
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,740
The bank teller asked this man to do a number of things in order to open his bank account

183
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,200
and she used some great expressions.

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Right.

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Let's listen to how she asked the man to do some things in a polite way.

186
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Yes.

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,400
I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

188
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,560
I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,720
I'll need your social insurance number.

190
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,840
I'll need your social insurance number.

191
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,640
If you could just sign here.

192
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,960
If you could just sign here.

193
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,520
The first thing she said is, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

194
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,280
I'll get you to.

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Right.

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,600
I'll get you to.

197
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
It's just a way of saying, can you please fill this out?

198
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes.

199
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll do this, but in a different way.

200
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
More polite.

201
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,440
It's pretty polite.

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,280
Then she also said, I'll need your social insurance number.

203
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
I'll need your.

204
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I'll need your.

205
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,380
Again, a polite way of saying.

206
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,960
Give me your social insurance number.

207
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,000
Give me your social insurance.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,880
And the last thing she said, and this is really polite.

209
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,160
If you could just sign here.

210
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Yes.

211
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,280
If you could just sign here.

212
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,040
If you could just.

213
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,200
If you could just wait a moment, I'll be with you.

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,400
If you could just send me an email with your bank account number.

215
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Right.

216
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,080
Very polite way of asking for something.

217
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Yep.

218
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,200
Well, some great language in today's cast.

219
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll catch all of this wonderful language.

220
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Next please.

221
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
May I help you, sir?

222
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Hello.

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Oh, yes.

224
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
I'd like to open a bank account.

225
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Certainly.

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
I can help you with that.

227
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
What type of account would you like to open?

228
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
A checking or a saving account?

229
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
What features do they offer?

230
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,480
Well, if you just take a look here, see, with our checking account, you can have unlimited

231
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,200
daily transactions for a small monthly fee.

232
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,560
And our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance

233
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
of $10,000.

234
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I see.

235
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,960
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

236
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

237
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,840
All right, then.

238
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,200
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

239
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,840
Will you require overdraft protection?

240
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,320
There is an extra fee for that.

241
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,860
No, that won't be necessary.

242
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,840
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

243
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:27,440
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

244
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,120
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

245
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Would you like to make a deposit today?

246
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,960
Yes, I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

247
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,000
$1 billion!

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:59,040
Okay, so an interesting thing here, not many countries use checks.

249
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
That's right.

250
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Right?

251
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
The checkbook or a check?

252
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,380
Yeah, it tends to be more of an American thing, don't you think?

253
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
It is, it is.

254
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
I think it is.

255
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,680
For those of you who aren't sure what a check is, it's basically a piece of paper that you

256
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
just sign your name and...

257
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Yeah, you write the amount of money and then you sign your name, right?

258
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,760
Right, and then you give that to the person, that person can take it to the bank and get

259
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
money in exchange for it.

260
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Yes.

261
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It's not very common in other countries.

262
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,160
No, but from what I know, every single American has a checkbook and uses it pretty regularly.

263
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,440
For example, you pay your phone bill or your electric bill, you just put a check in the

265
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
mailbox and it's paid.

266
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,120
And it's done.

267
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
It's an interesting thing.

268
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,720
But also, sometimes in other countries, people's salaries are paid through checks.

269
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes.

270
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Paycheck.

271
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Oh, yes.

272
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I see where that word comes from.

273
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Paycheck.

274
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Uh-huh.

275
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,440
But for example, here in China, it's not very common, right?

276
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
I've never seen a check here.

277
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Me neither.

278
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
What about in your countries?

279
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,960
We'd like to know how the banking system works.

280
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,280
Yes, come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us all about it.

281
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,880
Yes, and you can also leave your questions and comments on our website and we'll be there

282
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
to answer it.

283
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Yeah, Marco and I love answering your questions, so please visit us.

284
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
All right, but until then, it's goodbye.

285
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Bye.
