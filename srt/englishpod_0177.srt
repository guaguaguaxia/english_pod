00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, English learners and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,080
And my name is Katrin and it's the Christmas season, Marco.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,520
So that means we have a very festive lesson today.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
That's right.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,200
Christmas is coming up and well, a tradition among many people around the world is to buy

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,980
a Christmas tree.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
That's right.

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,440
I remember when we used to do this in my family.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,320
It was one of my favorite times of the year.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,180
So we're going to explore this in today's lesson.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,020
After we listen to the dialogue, we'll be back to talk about some of these interesting

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:43,600
words and phrases.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,560
I'm home.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Everyone come here.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,520
I bought a Christmas tree.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,480
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Wow, it's huge.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Awesome.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Of course it will.

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,880
Help me put it in the living room.

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,320
I found the lights.

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,840
I got the Christmas ornaments.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Great idea.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,160
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,040
All right, we're back.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,960
And as we mentioned, well, the entire dialogue is about a Christmas tree.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,760
So why don't you explain what a Christmas tree is because many people maybe don't even

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,600
do or buy Christmas trees.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,920
Okay, well, a Christmas tree is usually a green tree that we cut down and we put in

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
the house.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,080
Okay, so it's not a real tree with the roots in the ground.

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,840
But sometimes it comes from a real tree outside.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,800
And the tree is very small on the top and it goes out like a triangle.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Okay, so it's a special shape.

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,000
And we generally make it look very pretty with lights and ornaments and decorations.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,320
And on Christmas, on the 25th or the 24th, it depends where you come from, we put lots

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,640
of presents underneath the Christmas tree.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,280
Wow, it sounds amazing.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,480
Well, yeah, and it looks very nice.

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
It does look really beautiful.

45
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,180
And it's just a really special part of Christmas.

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,440
And well, as you mentioned, sometimes the tree is just a fake plastic tree.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,440
But many times it's a real tree and the type of tree that you use is a pine tree.

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Exactly.

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,520
And so pine tree is a kind of tree that doesn't have leaves.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,160
It has needles.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,700
That means that they're long, very thin green pieces that are all over the tree.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,480
And you can see these trees in most northern places like Scandinavia or in America, maybe

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,800
Illinois and Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont.

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,880
And they're very, as you say, very unique trees, but they also have a very special smell,

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
the smell of pine.

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
They do.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
It's very nice.

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,560
It's such a nice smell that a lot of the things that we use in America to clean our houses

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
have a pine smell because it makes the house smell nice.

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Very good.

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
So a pine tree.

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,920
The dad brought a pine tree or a Christmas tree home and well, the wife was a little

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
bit worried if it will fit.

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,960
Okay, will it fit?

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,080
This is a very important question because a lot of pine trees are very, very tall.

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,000
So if a pine tree is three meters tall or four meters tall, will it fit is the question

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we ask.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,440
Is it too big or is it going to be stuck on the ceiling in the house?

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,880
And so we could ask this about anything.

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,460
I just bought a new TV.

71
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,840
Will it fit in the living room?

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I don't know.

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
I'm very nervous.

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,440
I spent a lot of money.

75
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,600
All right.

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,680
And well, you were talking about the Christmas tree and how you put a lot of nice decorations

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
on it.

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,200
And so we say that we decorate the tree.

79
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
That's right.

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,920
So the verb here, this is an action word, to decorate.

81
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,820
So every holiday season in my family, we take one day and we decorate the tree.

82
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,960
That means that we take very small, special ornaments and ribbons and lights and we put

83
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
them on the tree to make the tree look pretty.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,360
You can also say decorate the house or to decorate the house for a party.

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,320
So this means to make something look special or pretty.

86
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,600
Very good.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,040
We've taken a look at very specific words related to Christmas trees and decorating

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
it.

89
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,640
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to continue with some more

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,520
language takeaway.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm home.

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Everyone come here.

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,860
I bought a Christmas tree.

94
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,800
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Wow, it's huge.

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,480
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

97
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Awesome.

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,920
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

99
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,440
Of course it will.

100
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Help me put it in the living room.

101
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,920
I found the lights.

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,460
I got the Christmas ornaments.

103
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,640
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
Great idea.

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,720
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

106
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,880
All right, we're back.

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,000
So why don't we take a look at three more words on Language Takeaway part two.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Language takeaway.

109
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,920
There's just so many words that are associated with Christmas and the Christmas season that

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,120
we have to look at them again here in Language Takeaway part two.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,040
And the first one we've already mentioned, it goes together with the phrase to decorate

112
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
the tree.

113
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,880
Okay, so what do we decorate the tree with, Marco?

114
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
You mentioned ornaments.

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
That's right.

116
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Christmas ornaments.

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Christmas ornaments.

118
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,000
So an ornament is a thing.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,080
It's something that we use to make something else look prettier.

120
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,540
And so in this case, ornaments are sometimes round and red or green or gold.

121
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,640
We hang them on the tree.

122
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,240
And well, in this case, it's a Christmas ornament for the tree.

123
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,840
But an ornament can be anything, any nice piece of art or something that you can use

124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,040
to decorate your house, right?

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Exactly.

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,720
And in my family, ornaments aren't just those round circles or balls for Christmas.

127
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,880
Every family member has a special kind of ornament.

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,960
So my dad has Santa Claus ornaments and my mom has bunny rabbit ornaments and I have

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,240
angel ornaments.

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,040
So everybody has a special one.

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, that's really nice.

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,080
And well, apart from ornaments, there is also this tradition of hanging stockings.

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Okay, so a stocking, you might have heard this word before in the sense of a clothing

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
item.

135
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,600
A stocking is like a sock.

136
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
A big sock.

137
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
A big sock.

138
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,320
And it also means the old stockings that women would wear, like tights.

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,480
But in this case, a stocking, a Christmas stocking is a very, very, very big sock that

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,280
we hang and on Christmas, we get to fill it with very special things like candy and toys.

141
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,640
Candy toys, very good.

142
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,480
So actually, you hang the stockings and the common place to do it in or to put them on

143
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,200
is on the chimney, right?

144
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
That's right.

145
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,760
So there's a fireplace and usually above the fireplace, there's a shelf.

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,480
We call it a mantle.

147
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,040
And there's a place there to hang these and the place where all of the smoke from the

148
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
fire comes out is the chimney.

149
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,560
It's also the place where Santa Claus comes down.

150
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Right.

151
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,160
So you have the fireplace where you put the wood, you have the mantle, that's the space

152
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,040
where you actually put the stockings on, and the tube that goes up and where the smoke

153
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,000
comes out of is called the chimney.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So you don't want to live there.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,280
And then actually, the joke is that Santa Claus is definitely too fat to go down the

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
chimney.

158
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,240
But it's a special place in the Christmas story because that's what Santa Claus does.

159
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Very good.

160
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Interesting words.

161
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:52,040
Why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

162
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm home.

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,920
Everyone come here.

164
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,960
I bought a Christmas tree.

165
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,920
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

166
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Wow, it's huge.

167
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

168
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Awesome.

169
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

170
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Of course it will.

171
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Help me put it in the living room.

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,760
I found the lights.

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,300
I got the Christmas ornaments.

174
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,480
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

175
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
Great idea.

176
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:31,040
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

177
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Alright we're back.

178
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,280
So as you say, the Christmas season is important in America and people not only decorate Christmas

179
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,500
trees but also their house and even outside.

180
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,320
They put Christmas lights all over the house.

181
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,880
They put little statues of Santa Claus and reindeer.

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,320
It's a very, I don't know, sometimes lavish thing to do.

183
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
It is.

184
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,760
It's almost funny how much people like to spend on not just time but also money on decorating

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
their houses.

186
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,880
So where I come from, people decorate the outsides a lot.

187
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,200
You have Christmas lights on all parts of the house and then maybe all of the reindeer

188
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
in the front yard.

189
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
All of them.

190
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
There are like 12 of them or 9 of them.

191
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I don't remember.

192
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
There's 12.

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,840
It was nice because when I lived there with my parents, we would go out and tour around

194
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,080
the neighborhood just to see other people's Christmas lights and decorations because as

195
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,200
we say, some of them can be very, very nice and they take a lot of time and effort into

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
decorating it.

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
They do.

198
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
It's really special.

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,000
At my house, we generally just decorated the inside but sometimes we did lights on the

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
outside.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
There are some very funny movies that talk about this like National Lampoon's Christmas

202
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Vacation.

203
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Right.

204
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,680
There are some really funny scenes about putting Christmas lights on the house.

205
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
All right.

206
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,320
Well, that's all the time we have for today but we'll definitely post a link of this movie

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,400
that's actually very good.

208
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,120
It kind of depicts the traditional American in a funny way.

209
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
It's a very funny movie.

210
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
All right.

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
And if you have any questions, any other doubts or comments, you can come to EnglishPod.com

215

Bye.

216

Merry Christmas.
