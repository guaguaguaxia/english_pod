00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,440
And Marco, today we're talking about a very important part of daily life.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
That's right.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,520
Today we're going to take a look at a lesson about technology and something that has become

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,480
so popular and part of our everyday lives that it's necessary for us to acknowledge

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,800
it in English.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
That's right.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,040
So we're talking about cellular phones, but not just cellular phones.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,440
Something you can do and that many people often do on their cellular phones.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
That's right.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,800
So before we get into that, let's listen to the dialogue, try to understand what it's

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,280
all about and we'll be back in a bit.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,800
Why didn't you text me last night?

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
What?

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
I sent you three or four messages.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
I didn't get any of them.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,880
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
message.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
Why didn't you just call?

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,640
I hate sending SMS messages.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,880
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,440
I used it all up this month.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,880
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,760
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me call or send messages.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,800
No wonder you didn't get my texts.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,960
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,840
So now let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,320
Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,160
First up on Language Takeaway, we have the verb that is the focus of today's dialogue,

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,480
to text.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
That's right.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,000
To text is a verb in this case, to text.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Text me.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,360
Why didn't you text me?

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,240
Why didn't you text me?

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,600
Now remember that text means other things in other situations.

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,640
Here it's a verb.

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,320
It's a very new word as a verb from the last maybe 15 years or so with cell phones.

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,320
So that's actually what it means is to send a text message via cell phone.

42
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,480
So you send a message.

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
That's right.

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,320
You actually write the message, right?

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
It's not a call.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,280
When I call you, I talk to you.

47
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,040
When you text someone, you actually write a message.

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,280
It's very short and then you send it and the other person can read it.

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Right.

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,800
So instead of saying, why didn't you send me a text message last night?

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,920
We just say, why didn't you text me?

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
All right.

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,080
Now, another word that we often hear about texts is the noun messages or message.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,080
So I sent you three or four messages.

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
That's right.

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,360
So when we're talking about texting someone, what we're doing is sending a message.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
A text message.

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
A text message.

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
That's right.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
Because we can send a voice message.

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
That's right.

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,520
So voice is me talking, hi Marco, it's Catherine.

63
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
How are you doing?

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Right.

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,640
But a text message is actually words.

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,280
I write them out.

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
That's right.

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
That's right.

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,880
So, but then we could actually use the verb form as well.

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,040
So we can say to text or we can say to message.

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Why didn't you message me last night?

72
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
That's right.

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,800
So we use this slang to message someone because text is very common and everyone uses it.

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
But normally young people say, hey, why didn't you message me?

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,720
Or aren't you ever going to message me?

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Right, right, right.

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,240
Or stop messaging in class.

78
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
That's right.

79
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,900
So these are verbs to text and to message.

80
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
That's right.

81
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,200
Now, if we see down towards the middle of the dialogue, we see that the person hates

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
sending SMS messages.

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,080
So it's kind of explaining already what's been said because you have SMS messages and

84
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,520
this abbreviation stands for?

85
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
Short message service.

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,000
Short S, message M, service S. So short message service.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,520
But most people around the world say SMS.

88
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Right.

89
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,120
So they say, oh, send me an SMS or send me an SMS message, which again, like we see in

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,840
the dialogue, it's kind of contradictory because we're already saying short message service

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
message.

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
Yeah, but most people don't know what SMS means.

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,760
So they just say, hey, send me an SMS message or send me a text message or I didn't get

94
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,120
your SMS.

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
That's right.

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,080
Now, lastly, we didn't get the SMS because we didn't have any credit on the phone.

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
All right.

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Now, credit is an important word here.

99
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
It's a noun.

100
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
It's a thing.

101
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,380
We have credit or we don't have credit.

102
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,920
And it's important to remember that credit stands for money.

103
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
All right.

104
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:29,200
So maybe I buy $10 of credit for my cell phone and that means I can send many, many messages.

105
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,840
But when I have zero credit, I can't send any messages.

106
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
That's right.

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,880
So this is important because usually in many places you have to have this amount of money

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,480
in your phone in order to be able to talk and send messages.

109
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,800
So this money that you have is called credit.

110
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,320
So you can say, I don't have any credit on my phone.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
That's right.

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320
And it's basically a way of having money without having real money.

113
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:03,320
You actually buy credit from your cell phone provider like AT&T or if you have China Telecom,

114
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
that's who you buy credit from.

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
That's right.

116
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Very good.

117
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:15,840
So let's get into the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

118
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
Why didn't you text me last night?

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
What?

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
I sent you three or four messages.

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
I didn't get any of them.

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,400
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
message.

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Why didn't you just call?

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,200
I hate sending SMS messages.

126
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,960
I used it all up this month.

128
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,400
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I do.

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,280
I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me call or send messages.

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,720
No wonder you didn't get my texts.

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
All right, we've prepared three phrases for you.

133
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,040
Let's start with those now in Fluency Builder.

134
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Fluency Builder.

135
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,320
So we're still talking about credit here.

136
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,240
Now when you have credit, you can use it.

137
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
But if you use all of it, we say you use it all up.

138
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Right.

139
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
We used it up.

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,960
To use something up.

141
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,520
So here, what does the up do?

142
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,920
Because we can use something, like I'm using my toothbrush, but to use up is different.

143
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Right, it means that you finished it.

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,640
It no longer exists.

145
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,560
So it's completed.

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,480
I had credit, I used it up, that means it is gone.

147
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,960
Right, exactly.

148
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,680
So for example, maybe paint.

149
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,840
You're painting a room and you used up all the white paint.

150
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,600
So you used all the paint, you have no more paint.

151
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
It's gone, so it's all used up.

152
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
It's a very important phrase to remember, it's used up.

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
That's right.

154
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Now going back to SMS and messages, the question came up and said, I thought you had an unlimited

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,200
SMS plan.

156
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,640
All right, so an unlimited SMS plan.

157
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,240
We know what SMS means, but first of all, let's talk about a plan.

158
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
Because when we talk about cell phones, it's important to remember that some people buy

159
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,720
credit, that's how they get service.

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
But some people buy plans.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,400
This is very popular, by the way, in America, this is how most phones are.

162
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,640
What is a plan?

163
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,760
So basically, it's just like any other service, like maybe internet.

164
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,720
You pay a monthly fee and you get a certain amount of this service.

165
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,120
So maybe you pay $50 and you get 100 minutes to use on your cell phone, an unlimited amount

166
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
of SMS.

167
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:33,360
All right, so basically, my cell phone provider, AT&T or Telecom, they will say, for this

168
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,280
price, you get this much time, this many messages each month, and you have to keep paying it.

169
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,440
Normally, it's one year or two years that you have to commit.

170
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,400
You can't say, nah, I don't want this anymore.

171
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,760
But the important thing here is that the person bought an unlimited SMS plan.

172
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,560
So this keyword there, unlimited, means it has no limit.

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,280
It means you can use it as much as you want.

174
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,680
So unlimited, no limits, that means you can do it as much as you want.

175
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,360
You can have unlimited calls, you get unlimited SMS, you can have unlimited data, for example.

176
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Exactly.

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Very good.

178
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,680
And we end it with saying, well, no wonder you didn't get my text.

179
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
Well, because he didn't have credit.

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
No wonder you didn't get it.

181
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,560
I know wonder is a great and very important phrase, and it's something we say when we

182
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,160
finally understand why something happened.

183
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,200
Right, we realize what happened.

184
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,000
So Marco, gosh, why didn't you respond to my calls?

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Well, I didn't have any credit.

186
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
No wonder.

187
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,720
That means, oh, now I understand.

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
No wonder.

189
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Exactly.

190
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,920
It's a great phrase to start off your sentence by explaining or letting the other person

191
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,000
know that you finally understand why this happened or you understand what the situation

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
was.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,280
All right, so let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

194
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,720
Why didn't you text me last night?

195
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
What?

196
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,600
I sent you three or four messages.

197
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I didn't get any of them.

198
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,440
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your

199
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
message.

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Why didn't you just call?

201
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,640
I hate sending SMS messages.

202
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

203
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,400
I used it all up this month.

204
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,840
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

205
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,720
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me call or send messages.

206
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,920
No wonder you didn't get my texts.

207
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,000
All right, we're back.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,480
So talking about messages and everything, do you send a lot of messages?

209
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,960
Because I know some people who send like 100 messages a day.

210
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,160
Well, that's usually teenagers.

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,640
Yeah, I don't send 100 messages a day.

212
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,800
I mostly use messages.

213
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,320
I don't call people very often.

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,880
I find that messages are easier and cheaper, actually.

215
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,760
But I can't imagine sending a thousand messages a day or a hundred messages a day.

216
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,640
Your thumbs would get so tired.

217
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,160
Well, I remember, well, this is back in the day when you had the little Nokia phones and

218
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,280
you didn't have the touch screens and all this stuff.

219
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,400
I did have some friends who were very, very agile with sending these messages and some

220
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,520
did send, I don't know, 100, 200 messages a day because it was that new way of communicating

221
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
with people.

222
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Yeah, it's very exciting.

223
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,560
And I will also mention, and this is something that my parents complain about, there is something

224
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,760
in America and I'm sure in England as well called text talk or text speak.

225
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,360
And so because messages are short, people have started to change the way they spell

226
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,280
or write words.

227
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,280
So instead of saying F-O-R, this is for you, they write, this is number for you.

228
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,800
And it's so funny because you see these normal words but written in a strange new way.

229
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,840
And people who are older, I think my parents' age, and I do too to some extent, really don't

230
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,040
like it because it's so different.

231
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,560
It's especially very popular with the younger generation because it translates now to all

232
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,680
sorts of messaging.

233
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,200
So before, as you say, it was because of the limitations, the amount of characters you

234
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,960
could send in a message.

235
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
But now it's just become something that people have gotten in the habit of doing.

236
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:30,000
So for example, instead of writing skate, like skateboard, they would write S-K and

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,380
then the number eight.

238
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
So skate.

239
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
That's right.

240
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,380
Skate.

241
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,380
Skate.

242
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
It's so strange.

243
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,520
And I know it actually happens in other languages as well.

244
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Yeah, a lot.

245
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,280
Italian, they do it a lot.

246
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,560
And Spanish, I'm sure as well.

247
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,440
But we call it text speak because it's very, very short and kind of abbreviated.

248
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,320
But it's a problem from my understanding is because these younger generations, they use

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,360
it so much that they really kind of start forgetting the proper grammar and proper spelling.

250
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,240
So even you will find, I saw a report the other day, essays or reports handed in with

251
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,320
these terrible spelling mistakes.

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
That's awful.

253
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,640
Well, I hope, hope, hope that people are learning grammar and spelling, especially non-native

254
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
learners of English.

255
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,360
So if you're doing homework for your English class, don't use these.

256
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,840
But it might be interesting to look them up.

257
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,720
So let us know though, do you text message people?

258
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,120
Do you send these text messages?

259
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,760
Do you have SMS service in your country?

260
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Let us know.

261
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

262
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
All right.

263
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
We'll see you guys there.

264
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Bye.

265
00:12:35,760 --> 00:13:04,920
Thank you.
