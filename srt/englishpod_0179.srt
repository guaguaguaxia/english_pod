00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,060
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,160
And it's the holiday season so that means more Christmas songs for you guys.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
That's right.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,680
And today we're going to be taking a look at a very famous song, very relaxed but very

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,480
beautiful song called Silent Night.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,040
Yeah, this is one of those songs that you hear everywhere but unlike Jingle Bells which

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,920
is like jingle bells, jingle bells, not, you know, very cheery and uplifting and shopping

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,960
music.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,160
This is more, as Marco said, calm, peaceful, almost church music.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,520
So we're going to find out what the words mean in this very classic song.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,280
Right, it's classic and very religious because it has a connotation towards the Catholic

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,360
religion.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:01:02,200
So why don't we listen to the song and then we'll be back to explain it.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:23,360
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:45,320
Round yon virgin, mother and child, holy infant so tender and mild.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:02:08,600
Sleep in heavenly peace.

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Alright we're back.

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,200
So now let's take a look at this song line by line.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
So we're not going to do the standard format of picking out words.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,760
We're going to do it line by line to kind of get a good feel for this dialogue.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
So first of all some background.

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay so the 24th, the evening, Mary and Joseph are looking for a place to stay.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
Mary, the virgin mother of God, is going to give birth to a baby.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,600
And they need a place to stay so finally they find a place.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,760
It's not a hotel, it's not a house.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
It's like an inn.

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,600
Yeah, well it's actually the stables for the inn, right?

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah, the stables for the inn, yeah.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,600
And so what the song is celebrating is what happens afterwards, after the baby Jesus is

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
born.

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
So that's where we are.

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Alright, so the first line says silent night, holy night.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,080
As you know it's holy, that means it's religiously special, it's important.

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Okay, all is calm, all is bright.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,440
So we talk about bright light sometimes.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,280
Something is bright if it gives a lot of light off.

39
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,720
And well the next line is very interesting because it says round yon virgin mother and

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
child.

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,920
Now you see this first two words there, round yon.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,280
What is round yon?

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,920
So round comes from around.

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Yon means over there.

45
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,160
So around over there, so over there we've got two people.

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,600
Over there we've got the virgin mother and her child.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Okay so the virgin mother is Mary, right?

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
That's right.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
And the child would be Jesus.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Exactly.

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,560
And it says holy infant, so tender and mild.

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
Okay so what is an infant?

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,120
An infant is a baby, some baby that's just been born.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
So we can say that infants are very, very delicate.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,680
You have to be very careful when you hold an infant.

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,240
But in this case a holy infant is Jesus, he's special for religious reasons.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,880
And when they say that he's tender and mild, what does he mean by that?

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,120
Well you talk about tender things when you're talking about things that are soft, delicate,

59
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,400
gentle or sweet.

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,880
And something that is mild or someone that is mild is very quiet and calm and gentle.

61
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,080
So not making much noise.

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:27,040
So the baby is very sweet, very tender and wasn't crying or making a big fuss.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,040
And then we have sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Well the baby's quiet because the baby's sleeping.

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,840
So you're saying sleep in heavenly peace, that means may the peace of heaven, because

66
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,080
heaven is a very peaceful place, the most peaceful place, may that peace be with you

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
when you're sleeping.

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
Okay, very good.

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,880
And moving on we have silent night, holy night again.

70
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,720
But then they say shepherds quake at the sight.

71
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
So what is this?

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,480
Shepherds we know that these are people that take care of sheep.

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,160
That's right, they make the sheep move from one place to another.

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
And it says they quake at the sight.

75
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,600
So they quake at the sight of what?

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,960
Well quake, we often say quiver in one's boots.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,000
So to quake means to shake when you're nervous.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,680
So you know when you're going to make a speech in front of many, many, many people, your

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,640
hands start to shake, that's called quaking.

80
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,320
So to quake.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,080
So shepherds quake, they're nervous at the sight, well the sight is the noun for seeing

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
something.

83
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
The sight of Jesus.

84
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Of the baby.

85
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,160
Glories stream from heaven afar.

87
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,840
So glories stream from heaven afar.

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,080
Okay, the verb here, the action word is to stream.

89
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
To stream.

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,560
Okay, that means to come down.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Okay.

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,640
Okay, so to come down in kind of big amounts.

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,040
So we have glory, glory, so happiness and joy and glory and good things coming down

94
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
from the heavens.

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,840
So lots of positive, good things coming down from heaven.

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
And where is heaven?

97
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Afar.

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Afar.

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
So the key part of this is the word far.

100
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,080
It's far away, right?

101
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Yeah.

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,520
Afar is an old word we use to describe something that's far away.

103
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,240
So the heavens afar, the heavens that are far away are giving us all of this joy and

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
happiness.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Okay.

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,060
And then the song says heavenly hosts sing hallelujah.

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,240
So heavenly hosts, those are bodies or people or spirits in the sky.

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Like angels.

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Angels.

110
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
They're singing hallelujah.

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,600
So hallelujah is a word that we often use in the Christian religion that comes from

112
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Greek actually.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Oh really?

114
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,280
So hallelujah is a Greek word and it means celebrate, joy, amen.

116
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay, hallelujah.

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,120
It's something you're happy about.

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Hallelujah.

119
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,160
Hallelujah.

120
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,880
And then they say Christ, the savior is born.

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
Now we have this, the savior.

122
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
What is it?

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Who is a savior?

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
What is a savior?

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
It's a very good question.

126
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,600
A savior is a word we only really, well, we don't hear that often, but you've heard the

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,720
word to save before.

128
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,720
So for example, I fell into the water and Marco jumped in and saved me.

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
So I would be a savior?

130
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,160
Marco is my savior.

131
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,740
He saved me.

132
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,840
But in this case, savior refers to the Bible and the things that Jesus did later.

133
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,960
So we say in Christianity, he saved people, the humankind.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,320
So he is the savior.

135
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,240
Christ the savior.

136
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
All right.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,960
And then our next verse, it says, silent night, holy night, son of God loves pure light, radiant

138
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,540
beams from thy holy face.

139
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,040
So we have radiant beams and then we have this word thy.

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,020
So these beams is like a beam of light, right?

141
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,560
It's like a line of light, but you know how light is clear.

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,160
So a beam of light is something that comes down in a straight line.

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
You can see it.

144
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
You can see it.

145
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,840
So for example, when I turn on a flashlight and there's a line of light, that's a beam.

146
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
And radiant means it's very bright.

147
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
It's very clear.

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,440
Clear and it's strong and it's coming out from that one place.

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,000
And what about this word thy?

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,500
It's very popular, like old English, right?

151
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,960
It's an old English form of saying you.

152
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,280
So in the olden days in English, we had different ways of saying the word you.

153
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,000
And so thy is one of those words and you hear this very often.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,880
And so in this sentence, we're saying radiant beams from thy holy face.

155
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,560
We're now starting to talk to Jesus because we're referring to him.

156
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,680
You radiant beams, light is coming out of your face.

157
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Your holy face.

158
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Because you're such a holy.

159
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,520
I think you can probably see this thy and thou in Shakespeare, for example, right?

160
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Exactly.

161
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Shakespeare, the Bible, prayers, and all sorts of old books and poetry.

162
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,640
And then we say with the dawn of redeeming grace.

163
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,400
So what is to redeem?

164
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,400
To redeem is to find value in something that didn't have value before.

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,760
So maybe I have a ticket for some, okay, I won a small lottery ticket, $5.

166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,320
I go to the store to redeem my money.

167
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,200
The paper is worthless, but it's worth something when I redeem it.

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,280
So Christ the Redeemer, when he saves people, he redeems them.

169
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,960
He gives them value again.

170
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Very good.

171
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,420
So it's a very profound song, right?

172
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:38,140
And it talks about, as we say, about Jesus, about angels, and it's very, very religious.

173
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,480
So it's a great song and it's, well, it's a very popular song.

174
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,680
And well, even if you don't share the religious connotation that the song has, it still is

175
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,120
very popular in North America and many parts of the world.

176
00:09:50,120 --> 00:10:01,020
So why don't we have a listen to this song one last time?

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:11:13,060
So when I was a little girl at school, we had to sing this in German.

178
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,860
So I know that there are some other countries that have the same song with different words.

179
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,580
So it's the same rhythm and everything, but just in German.

180
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,300
And is it pretty much the same idea, the same words?

181
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah, almost exactly the same, just in a translated form.

182
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,180
Maybe it came from German, I don't know.

183
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,820
Because it seems to be pretty old, right?

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,420
But it is a very common song during Christmas.

185
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,300
And even many times, Christmas carolers will go around in the neighborhood and sing these

186
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,220
songs in different places, right?

187
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
Exactly.

188
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,900
And it's a really beautiful song, one of my favorites.

189
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,940
And I'm not a religious person, so I don't really like it for the religious perspective

190
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
that it gives.

191
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,300
But I do think that it's just one of those beautiful classic songs that makes the season

192
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
very warm and special.

193
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
The music is nice in this song.

194
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,700
Alright, so an interesting song and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of questions and

195
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,740
comments about it.

196
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,380
So we expect to see you guys on our website EnglishPod.com and we'll see you guys there.

197
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Happy holidays and enjoy.

198
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Bye guys.

199
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Enjoy Christmas, sing along with us.
