00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,440
My name is Kathryn and today we're going to play a game.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
That's right.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,120
Today we're going to describe someone's face.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,520
So we're going to try to guess who that person is.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Okay, so there are lots of really great words to describe people's faces in this lesson.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,240
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:31,200
going on.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Let's play a game.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,640
Okay, how about Scrabble?

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
No, no.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,640
A friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,480
I'm going to describe someone's face and you guess who it is.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Okay.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,640
Let's see.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,000
He has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
Our cousin Pete.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,380
My turn.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,280
He has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Aunt Rose.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
That mole is so huge.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,360
Okay, my turn.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,840
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,240
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,480
Oh, he's also bald.

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,280
Your future husband.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
Not funny.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:25,040
All right, we're back so now let's take a look at five key words that we have to describe

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,920
someone's face on Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,340
Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,560
So we've got a couple words for noses here.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,680
They're adjectives to describe noses.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,560
The first one that we heard is Roman nose.

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Okay.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
So if someone has a Roman nose, does that mean they're from Rome?

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
No, not quite.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Well, Rome as we know is a city in Italy but it's also an adjective here.

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Roman means that the nose is straight on top.

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
It's like a triangle.

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
But it's kind of long.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,080
You have kind of a long straight nose, right?

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
That's right.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,520
A very long straight nose.

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Okay.

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,500
So we have Roman nose, somebody that has a long straight nose.

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,840
Now what about a pointy nose?

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,280
A pointy nose means that the tip of the nose is pointy.

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,080
So maybe it goes up a little bit, goes down and then up.

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
But usually there's a point on the tip of the nose.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Or sometimes the nose is very thin, right?

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,500
It's not very wide so it looks very pointy.

54
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
That's right.

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,520
So it kind of gets very narrow at the end there.

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
That's right.

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Okay.

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,800
And now maybe you broke your nose once or you had an accident and some people have a

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
crooked nose.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,160
Yeah, a lot of very famous football players have crooked noses because you get hit in

61
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,760
the face with the football and then your nose always has a bump.

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,520
Something is crooked if it's not straight.

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,160
So crooked is the opposite of a Roman nose or a straight nose.

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
That's right.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,540
So maybe you see boxers also I think have crooked nose.

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,960
Most of them are hockey players and stuff like that.

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, they take a lot of hits to the face.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,240
Okay, so now moving on that we've described noses in many ways.

69
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,480
You can say long nose, short nose or whatever but this is another way of doing it.

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,120
And what about eyebrows?

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,880
Okay, eyebrows are those lines of hair above your eyes.

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,360
And some people have really thick eyebrows.

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Some people have very thin eyebrows.

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,960
But if someone has thick eyebrows, lots of hair, we call them bushy eyebrows.

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Okay.

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,400
So if you have bushy eyebrows, it means that you have a lot of hair as you said on your

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
eyebrows or over your eye.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,120
And now this is a really I think kind of a nice feature that some people have on their

79
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
cheeks.

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,440
We have dimples.

81
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,960
I love dimples.

82
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,640
Not many people have them.

83
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,960
But these are two little dots, little indentations that appear when a person smiles.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
That's right.

85
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,200
Maybe you've seen this or maybe you have this or a friend has this.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,080
Somebody smiles and on their cheeks towards the middle of the cheek, they have little

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,840
holes that form that look like, I don't know, like somebody kind of pinched it with a needle.

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,920
Yeah, like it goes down a little bit for some reason.

89
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,240
It goes like yeah, they're being pinched inside their cheek.

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
That's right.

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Those are called dimples.

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Dimples.

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,840
Okay, so a lot of great stuff there in the first part.

94
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,480
Let's review what we've heard.

95
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:39,760
Let's go back to the dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Let's play a game.

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Okay.

98
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
How about Scrabble?

99
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
No, no.

100
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,200
A friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,040
I'm going to describe someone's face and you guess who it is.

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Okay.

103
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
Let's see.

104
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,560
He has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples.

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,760
Our cousin Pete.

106
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
My turn.

107
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,840
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin.

108
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Aunt Rose.

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,880
That mole is so huge.

110
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,940
Okay, my turn.

111
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,400
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

113
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,040
Oh, he's also bald.

114
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Your future husband.

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:28,800
Not funny.

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
All right, we're back.

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,120
So now we're going to take a look at even more words on how to describe a face.

118
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,360
So now let's take a look at Language Takeaway Part 2.

119
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
Language Takeaway.

120
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,600
Okay, so the first word has to do with the eyes.

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,120
We just talked about the eyebrows.

122
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
Those are above your eyes.

123
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Well, what happens if your eyes are very, very deep in your face?

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,720
Okay, we heard that in the dialogue.

125
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,160
We heard that in the dialogue described as sunken eyes.

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,960
So sunken means very far back or very deep in something.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,440
Think about a sunken ship.

128
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,180
It's under the water, under the ocean.

129
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,440
So someone with sunken eyes probably has dark rings under their eyes because their eyes

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,280
are so deep in their head.

131
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
That's right.

132
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,320
And the opposite, maybe you've seen people that have eyes that are almost like popping

133
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
out a little bit.

134
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Right.

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
His eyes pop out.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,720
That means they come out of the face.

137
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,640
They're closer to the skin.

138
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
That's right.

139
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Okay, and now this is something that many people have and even some models have become

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,640
famous because of this.

141
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,760
Many times called a beauty mark.

142
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
We're talking about moles.

143
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Cindy Crawford is probably the model you're talking about.

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
She had a very famous mole.

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,560
A mole is basically a spot on your skin that's very, very dark.

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,480
So sometimes there's hair on it.

147
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,840
Sometimes its texture is different.

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,960
But it can be big, it can be small.

149
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
But it's a change of texture on your skin.

150
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
That's right.

151
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,280
So usually it's like a little brown ball if it's big.

152
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,720
And sometimes they just look like little spots on your skin, little dark brown spots.

153
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
That's right.

154
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,680
But they're not the same as something else we heard in today's dialogue.

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
So we'll wait for that.

156
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,120
But a mole usually comes a little bit off the skin.

157
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,780
And it's usually bigger than other dots.

158
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
That's right.

159
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,200
And I think what you're talking about is freckles.

160
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
That's right, freckles.

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,640
A lot of people have these when they're children.

162
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,080
They come on your nose and your cheeks and even your arms.

163
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,800
And they're smooth with your skin.

164
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
They don't come off your skin.

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,900
They're not puffy.

166
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
That's right.

167
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:43,160
And I think many of you maybe if you have lighter skin may have freckles.

168
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,120
And that's usually just little spots but of just different color on your skin.

169
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,240
So usually people that have maybe red hair, they have freckles.

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,160
Like maybe from the Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter's best friend, I think Ron.

171
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Ron, yeah.

172
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
You can see he has freckles.

173
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
That's right.

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,600
On his skin he has lots of little dots.

175
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Because he has very pale skin and red hair.

176
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,720
So these are called freckles.

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
That's right.

178
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay.

179
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,760
And now when we talked about lips, a nice way of describing lips, you can say big lips

180
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,520
but that just means that they're big, right?

181
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,200
But what about if that person has full lips?

182
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
Full lips is a great way to describe big lips.

183
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,160
We would say someone like Angelina Jolie has very full lips.

184
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
That's right.

185
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,040
This means that they're not thin but they've got a lot of puff to them.

186
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
They have a lot of texture.

187
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,120
As you said, Angelina Jolie is probably the best example of someone with full lips.

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,460
And now what about bald?

189
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,460
Someone who's bald.

190
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Who's a good example for this?

191
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Okay.

192
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,600
So this next word we've got is bald.

193
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,880
Who's a famous bald person?

194
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,320
Maybe you've heard of Kobe Bryant.

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
That basketball player.

196
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
That's right.

197
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Now he's not completely bald.

198
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
He actually shaves his head.

199
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,520
But anyone who shaves their head also or has no hair on their head is considered to be

200
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
a bald person.

201
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
All right.

202
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,600
So bald means no hair on their head.

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Right.

204
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,760
Now sometimes naturally people become bald.

205
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,120
Hair falls off as the years go by and no more hair grows on their head.

206
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
So they're bald.

207
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
That's right.

208
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,300
So this happens to a lot of people, especially men.

209
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
They lose their hair.

210
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,680
Some people have a little bit of hair.

211
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,880
Some people lose all of their hair.

212
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,680
But when you lose hair on your head, it's called going bald.

213
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
That's right.

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Okay.

215
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,280
So now we have a lot of words and how we can describe people.

216
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,960
And so why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk

217
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:43,080
a little bit more.

218
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Let's play a game.

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Okay.

220
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
How about Scrabble?

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
No, no.

222
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,520
A friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

223
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm going to describe someone's face and you guess who it is.

224
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Okay.

225
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,520
Let's see.

226
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,880
He has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples.

227
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,080
Our cousin Pete.

228
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,240
My turn.

229
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,160
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin.

230
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Aunt Rose.

231
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,200
That mole is so huge.

232
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Okay.

233
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
My turn.

234
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,720
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

235
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,200
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

236
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
Oh, he's also bald.

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
Your future husband.

238
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,640
Not funny.

239
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,800
So we've talked a lot about the different parts of the face, but we have not talked

240
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,120
about one important part.

241
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,920
That's the bottom of a person's face along that bone there.

242
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
What's that part called?

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
That's called the chin.

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Okay.

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,960
So we could say some people have very, very prominent or big chins, right?

246
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
Like for example, Jay Leno.

247
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Oh yeah.

248
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,560
His chin is so big.

249
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,840
It's almost a joke among people that he has this big chin.

250
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
That's right.

251
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
So he has a long chin.

252
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Now, other people may have a very square chin.

253
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,720
So it's almost like it looks like a square on the bottom of their face.

254
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
Otherwise, you could have a round chin.

255
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
That's right.

256
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,240
And the opposite part of the face is also very important.

257
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,460
We call it not the top of your head, but we call it your forehead.

258
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
Your forehead.

259
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,700
Now, some people have a very big forehead, right?

260
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,760
Because maybe their hair grows a little bit further back.

261
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
And other people have smaller foreheads that you almost can't even really see.

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,320
Or sometimes they just hide it with their hair.

263
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
That's right.

264
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,440
And actually talking about chins, there's another type of chin that's also very popular.

265
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,160
John Travolta's chin.

266
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
That is.

267
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,200
He has a dimple in his chin.

268
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
That's right.

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,080
I remember we were talking about dimples, those little holes.

270
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
You can have them in other places and the chin is one of them.

271
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
That's right.

272
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,640
So I think that's called a butt chin, if I'm not mistaken, right?

273
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm not even going to ask.

274
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I've heard it before.

275
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm not sure how to answer you, but yeah.

276
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,560
So maybe this is a good time to encourage you all to tell us about your facial features

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,320
or to describe someone for us.

278
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
Use some of the vocabulary that you heard today.

279
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
That's right.

280
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Or maybe you even just want to describe someone famous and we can guess who you're talking

281
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
about.

282
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Good challenge.

283
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
So we will see you on our website, EnglishPod.com.

284
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
All right.

285
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
We'll see you guys there.

286
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:27,200
Thanks very much for having us.
