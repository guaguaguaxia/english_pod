00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello English learners and welcome to another lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,480
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,480
And today we're bringing you a great Christmas lesson.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
That's right.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,240
We've got a lot of Christmas vocabulary in today's lesson for you.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,160
Yeah, it's almost Christmas time so everyone is getting into the spirit, especially here

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,880
at EnglishPod, so we're going to teach you a little bit more about this.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,600
Speaking of the spirit, I think it's time for us to look at our vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,080
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,760
So in this part of our show, we'll look at some key language in the dialogue that you'll

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,320
need to know to understand the dialogue.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,320
And actually today we only have one word.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Eggnog.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Eggnog.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Eggnog.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
E-G-G-N-O-G.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Eggnog.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,400
So, eggnog is a really popular Christmas drink.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,040
It's a traditional Christmas drink.

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Right.

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
What is it made of?

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,800
It's eggs, cream, sugar, and usually rum.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Rum.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Oh, so it has alcohol.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah, normally it has alcohol.

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Okay.

28
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
All right.

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
That's interesting.

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,120
There's actually a drink very similar to this in Chile.

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Really?

32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Yep.

33
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
They call it monkey tail.

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
So in Spanish that would be...

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Cola de mono.

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Very nice.

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah, so it's actually really, really good.

38
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,080
I mean, it's really similar to eggnog.

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Okay.

40
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,720
So with that in mind, let's take a listen to our dialogue for the first time.

41
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:36,280
I hate working on Christmas Eve.

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,760
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Come in, Central.

44
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,240
I think we got ourselves a situation here.

45
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:59,200
License and registration, please.

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,640
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

47
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,000
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Step out of the vehicle, please.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Sir, what do you have in the back?

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,120
Just a few Christmas gifts.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,640
Tis the season, after all.

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't take that tone with me.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,240
Do you have an invoice for these items?

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
Oh, no.

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,800
I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,640
You are under arrest, sir.

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,360
You have the right to remain silent.

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
You better not pout.

59
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
You better not cry.

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,360
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
You have the right to an attorney.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,280
If you can't afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,320
You can't take me to jail.

65
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
What about my sleigh?

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
It's Christmas Eve.

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
I have presents to deliver.

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Rudolph, prancer, dancer, good health!

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,360
Well I did not see that one coming.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
That was interesting.

71
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,000
Santa Claus is being taken to jail.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,640
What's gonna happen next, Marco?

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
I don't know.

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,880
We'll talk about that in a little while.

75
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Let's take a look at some language from this dialogue.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
Language takeaway.

77
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
So the first word that we have on our language takeaway today is vehicle.

78
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Vehicle.

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Vehicle.

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Vehicle.

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:44,280
So this is a vehicle.

82
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:56,560
And this is a vehicle.

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:10,720
And this is a vehicle.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,580
So all of those are vehicles.

85
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,360
Now I thought that a vehicle was a car specifically.

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,600
No, any machine that carries people from one place to another is a vehicle.

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Great.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Alright.

89
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,880
Let's take a look now at our second word.

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Attorney.

91
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Attorney.

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Attorney.

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,640
So what is an attorney?

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
A lawyer.

95
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Well that's simple enough.

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Yep, a lawyer.

97
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,880
Let's move to our third word which is appoint.

98
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Appoint.

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Appoint.

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Appoint.

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,080
So appoint means choose.

102
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Okay, so the president of a country might appoint his chief of staff.

103
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,200
Right, or I can appoint my attorney.

104
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
True.

105
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,320
So can you appoint a thing?

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,640
Can I appoint my coffee cup?

107
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
No, no.

108
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
You only use it for people.

109
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
You choose someone.

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Okay, appoint.

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
You can't choose something.

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
So I appoint someone.

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Exactly.

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Alright, let's move to our final word.

115
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Sleigh.

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Sleigh.

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Sleigh.

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Sleigh.

119
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,400
So, Erica, you're from Canada.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
You can tell us about sleighs.

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Alright.

122
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,720
A sleigh is a vehicle that is pulled by a horse and travels over snow or ice.

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Okay.

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
So, you know, like Santa drives a sleigh.

125
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
He drives a sleigh.

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
So do you drive a sleigh or ride a sleigh?

127
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Good question.

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Well, the song says you ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

129
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Right, okay.

130
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Well, you know what?

131
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,640
I think it's time for us to look at some interesting phrases that we found in this dialogue.

132
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,360
So let's look at putting it together.

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Putting it together.

134
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,560
Today on Putting it Together, we have two great phrases for you and let's take a look

135
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,920
at the first one.

136
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Step out.

137
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,440
Step out.

138
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Step out.

139
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,440
So step out means to go out of a place for a short period of time.

140
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Right.

141
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,040
So in our dialogue, for example, the police officer said, step out of the vehicle.

142
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,540
Get out of your vehicle.

143
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,580
You can also say, step out of the office.

144
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,640
You can say, I just stepped out of the shower.

145
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Right.

146
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,000
Now, we can also say, step in.

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's the opposite.

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
The opposite, right?

149
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,720
I can ask Marco, step into my office for a moment.

150
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,040
Oh, okay.

151
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,160
So that's step out and step in.

152
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,280
Great phrases.

153
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,600
Let's take a look at our final phrase.

154
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Get a load of.

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Get a load of.

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,920
Get a load of.

157
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,960
So when I say get a load of something, I mean look at, right?

158
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Right.

159
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Look at this guy.

160
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Get a load of this guy.

161
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah, that's what we heard in the dialogue.

162
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Now, you can use this phrase in a number of different ways and we have some examples for

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
you.

164
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,760
Example one.

165
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Get a load of this.

166
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,720
A war has started in Antarctica.

167
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,760
Example two.

168
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,120
Get a load of that house.

169
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,000
It's so big.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Example three.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,080
Get a load of him.

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,640
He's wearing a pink suit.

173
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,680
Okay, I think we've covered a lot of interesting words and phrases, so we are ready to listen

174
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,080
to our dialogue a second time.

175
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,880
But this time it's going to be a little bit slower so we can pick up all these great words.

176
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,960
I hate working on Christmas Eve.

177
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

178
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,200
Come in central.

179
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,920
I think we got ourselves a situation here.

180
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,160
Passes and registration please.

181
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,000
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,800
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

183
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
Step out of the vehicle, please.

184
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,000
Sir, what do you have in the back?

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Just a few Christmas gifts.

186
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,400
Tis the season, after all.

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Don't take that tone with me.

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,520
Do you have an invoice for these items?

189
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
Um, no.

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,480
I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

191
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,760
You are under arrest, sir.

192
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,720
You have the right to remain silent.

193
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,960
You better not pout.

194
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
You better not cry.

195
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,440
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

196
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,360
You have the right to an attorney.

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,760
If you cannot afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

198
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,200
Do you understand all these rights that have just been read to you?

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,000
You can't take me to jail.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,160
What about my sleigh?

201
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,680
It's Christmas Eve.

202
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,200
I have presents to deliver.

203
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Rudolph, prancer, dancer, get help.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Okay, so we noticed some really great words and phrases and with this, now we can start

205
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,080
with some Fluency Builder.

206
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Fluency Builder.

207
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Today, on Fluency Builder, we have two great phrases that you can use to sound a little

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
bit more natural when you speak.

209
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
That's right.

210
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:20,560
Our first phrase you can use if you want to say, don't speak to me like that.

211
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,720
Don't take that tone with me.

212
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
Don't take that tone with me.

213
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,280
So you often hear this phrase coming out of the mouth of a mother or a father.

214
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,480
Yeah, when their children are maybe talking back.

215
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Yeah.

216
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,800
Don't take that tone with me, young man.

217
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
I used to get that a lot.

218
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Really?

219
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm not sure about that.

220
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,640
Okay, our second phrase, we use it when we have a problem.

221
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,600
The phrase we heard in the dialogue was, I think we've got ourselves a situation here.

222
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Let's listen to another example.

223
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,680
Houston, we've got ourselves a situation here.

224
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,320
Houston, we've got ourselves a situation here.

225
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,520
Sometimes I use this phrase when I want to tell my boss that I have a problem.

226
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,840
I might say, boss, I've got a bit of a situation.

227
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,040
Can you help me with it?

228
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Okay.

229
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Yeah, I have a little bit of a problem.

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Yeah.

231
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Useful phrases, hey?

232
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,760
Really useful phrases.

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Great stuff.

234
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,400
So now we can listen to our dialogue a final time and this time we can understand everything

235
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:35,240
that's in it.

236
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,520
I hate working on Christmas Eve.

237
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,280
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

238
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,320
Come in, Central.

239
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:58,240
I think we've got ourselves a situation here.

240
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,680
License and registration, please.

241
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,120
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

242
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,520
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

243
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
Step out of the vehicle, please.

244
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,000
Sir, what do you have in the back?

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,560
Just a few Christmas gifts.

246
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,120
Tis the season, after all.

247
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,480
Don't take that tone with me.

248
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,600
Do you have an invoice for these items?

249
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,920
Oh, no.

250
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,280
I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

251
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,120
You are under arrest, sir.

252
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,840
You have the right to remain silent.

253
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
You better not pout.

254
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
You better not cry.

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,840
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

256
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
You have the right to an attorney.

257
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,760
If you can't afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

258
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,640
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

259
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
You can't take me to jail.

260
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,280
What about my sleigh?

261
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
It's Christmas Eve.

262
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,400
I have presents to deliver.

263
00:11:47,400 --> 00:12:07,480
Rudolph, prancer, dancer, good health.

264
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,200
So when the police officer was arresting Santa Claus, he said something a little bit strange,

265
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
hey?

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah, he said, you better not pout.

267
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
You better not cry.

268
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Now, are those part of the normal rights that a police officer reads?

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
No, no.

270
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,880
They're not part of the normal rights.

271
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:32,960
It's actually from a Christmas song, so let's listen to how it goes in the song.

272
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
You better watch out.

273
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
You better not cry.

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
You better not pout.

275
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm telling you why.

276
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:45,280
Santa Claus is coming to town.

277
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,920
I'm pretty happy we had a song to play there instead of us having to sing.

278
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,720
Yeah, but that's great because if the children cry or if they are not good kids, then Santa

279
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
Claus will not give them presents.

280
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,760
So that's why.

281
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,120
Okay, listeners, I hope that you're not pouting.

282
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,160
I hope you're not crying, but it's time for us to go.

283
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,320
So be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com and be sure to leave all your questions and

284
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,400
comments and maybe some of your Christmas stories.

285
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:42,480
All right, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
