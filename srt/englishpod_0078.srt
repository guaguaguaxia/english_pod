00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,920
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,680
And today we're bringing you an advanced lesson for all of our advanced learners out there.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
That's right.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,880
And in this lesson, we're visiting a history class.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,160
Yes, we're going to be talking about a very interesting topic that's known around the

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,980
world which is International Workers' Day.

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,980
That's right.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,800
And we're going to learn a little bit about the history of the workers' movement in the

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
United States.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,500
Right, but we're also going to be taking a look at some great words and of course a little

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
bit more advanced or complicated structures.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
That's right.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:52,880
So I guess without further ado, we can get started with the dialogue.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,860
All right everyone, settle down.

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,860
Let's get started.

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,400
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,520
of our legal system.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,740
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,780
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,840
This brings me to our topic for today.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,040
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Cinco de Mayo.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,080
No, that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,440
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,680
No, May 1st is International Workers' Day.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,880
Do we get a day off from school then?

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
No.

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,520
It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
is.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Oh man.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,360
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling with workers being forced to work

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,840
10, 12, and 14 hours a day.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,100
Support for the 8-hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,880
and hostility of many union leaders.

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,400
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,040
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,880
took drastic measures.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,620
They passed a resolution stating that 8 hours would constitute a legal day's work.

41
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,720
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Cool.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,120
Is that why we only work 8 hours now?

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Yes.

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
But the happy ending came at a high price.

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,920
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,800
factory, killing four and wounding many.

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,720
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,200
And then what happened?

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:48,520
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
All right.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,520
So we were in a history class and we learned something new, something interesting, right?

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Yeah.

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
International Workers' Day.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,160
It's not celebrated in the US, but in many other countries it is.

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Right.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,080
On May 1st, a lot of people have a day off, so that's always good.

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Yes.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
All right.

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,800
So why don't we take a look at some of the words that we saw in this dialogue, which

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,320
were maybe a little bit different or difficult in Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Language Takeaway.

63
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
All right.

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,480
We're just going to look at five words here.

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,360
And the first one, we talked about the genesis of the movement.

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Right.

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Genesis.

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Genesis.

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Okay.

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,080
So many of you may know that Genesis is a book in the Bible, right?

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
That's right.

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
And that's where this word comes from.

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,980
It's the first book in the Bible.

74
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,280
So it's the beginning.

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Or the origin.

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Origin.

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
So that's a genesis.

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
The genesis of our legal system, you would say.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Right.

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
Or the genesis of this problem.

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
So it's the origin.

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Yeah.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a little bit of a formal word, isn't it?

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,440
I guess maybe you can say the origin or the beginning.

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Yeah.

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,480
But maybe in an academic setting, you can talk about the genesis.

88
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Yes.

89
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Very good.

90
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
All right.

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
What do we have next?

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Well, one of the reasons why the workers' movement got started was because of the appalling

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
working conditions.

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Appalling.

95
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Appalling.

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
So if something is appalling...

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
It's shockingly bad.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Very very bad.

99
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Yeah.

100
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,800
So now if something is appalling, like the working conditions were appalling...

101
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
That's right.

102
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
You would feel appalled.

103
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Exactly.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,120
I'm appalled at your behavior.

105
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay.

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
So it's almost like you are disgusted.

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah.

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
That's right.

109
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Very very strong word.

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Yeah.

111
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Very strong.

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay.

113
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Okay.

114
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
So the working conditions were appalling and people were setting up this movement, right?

115
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
But what happened?

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
They met some hostility.

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Hostility.

118
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Hostility.

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Hostility.

120
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Hostility from the police, right?

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
That's right.

122
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,760
So what is hostility?

123
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,280
Hostility is the state of receiving an unfriendly reaction.

124
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Okay.

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
They acted in a very unfriendly way and it also suggests, you know, a hint of violence

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
even.

127
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Okay.

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Yeah.

129
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Yeah.

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
So if somebody is hostile, they can maybe be aggressive and maybe to a point, violent.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So a hostile person.

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
Or a hostile environment, a dangerous environment.

136
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Okay.

137
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Very hostile.

138
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Very good.

139
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah.

140
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,000
Now because of these appalling working conditions, the labor movement decided to take drastic

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,640
measures.

142
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Drastic measures.

143
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Yeah.

144
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Drastic measures.

145
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,040
This is a really wonderful phrase and I think it would help us to listen to a few examples

146
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,080
of this phrase in use.

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,560
Example one.

148
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,440
The president was faced with some difficult decisions and was forced to take drastic measures

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,720
to solve the crisis.

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,800
Example two.

151
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:47,480
The police took very drastic measures to control the protesters outside the government palace.

152
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,520
So we understand drastic measures as extreme actions or decisions, right?

153
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Yeah, exactly.

154
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,240
I think there's a saying that says desperate times call for drastic measures.

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,280
No, desperate times call for desperate measures.

156
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Dang.

157
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, okay, but it goes around there somewhere, right?

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Something like that.

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
So if you really have an emergency, you need to do something drastic.

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,080
You have to take drastic measures or you can even say take drastic action.

161
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay.

162
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Very good.

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
And what about our last word?

164
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,520
After the protests ended in violence, people started to get angry because of the brutality

165
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
the police showed.

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Okay.

167
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Brutality.

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Brutality.

169
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,520
So maybe brutality and hostility are maybe similar, right?

170
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
A little bit similar.

171
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,480
So brutality is the state of being harsh or very forceful.

172
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Okay.

173
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
So brutality.

174
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
Now, we also use the word brutal.

175
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Right.

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,640
So that means harsh or very forceful.

177
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Now sometimes we can use that word, but not in a harsh or forceful way, right?

178
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Yeah.

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
And it's quite, yeah.

180
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,080
I might say something like, oh my God, that test was brutal.

181
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
It was brutal or...

182
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,280
So it was really hard or really difficult.

183
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Right.

184
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,040
So that's what you're saying with this word that it's very hard or it was very intense.

185
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Yeah.

186
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Maybe one more example.

187
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Okay.

188
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,560
So for example, I can say, oh, I went for a run today and it was brutal.

189
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm so tired.

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
So it was really difficult.

191
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Yeah.

192
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Yeah.

193
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
And Marco, is this something that's used by everyone?

194
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,040
That phrase, brutal, using in that context would be for younger people maybe.

195
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,360
Not really, you wouldn't really hear older people using it.

196
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
So it's a little bit slangy.

197
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Yeah.

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Yeah.

199
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Okay.

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
So those are five interesting vocabulary words.

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,840
As Marco mentioned, we want to look at some more difficult structures now in Fluency Builder.

202
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Fluency Builder.

203
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Okay.

204
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,280
So we have some phrases that we saw in this dialogue and well, let's start with the first

205
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
one.

206
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,400
Well, the teacher opens his discussion by talking about how an understanding of the

207
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,000
legal system is an important aspect of being a good citizen.

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

209
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,140
An important aspect.

210
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
An important aspect.

211
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,160
So, well, maybe we know the word important, right?

212
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
So what's an aspect?

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,920
Obviously, a part of something, an important part of something.

214
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Okay.

215
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,280
So the teacher started with an important aspect of and then specified the idea or what part

216
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
it belongs to.

217
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Right.

218
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
So it usually follows this form.

219
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,480
Noun is an important aspect of noun.

220
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Okay.

221
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,520
So for example, quality control is an important aspect of keeping customers happy.

222
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Okay.

223
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Perfect.

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
A part of.

225
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Very good.

226
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,240
So it's a lot more formal or just a lot more intelligent, right?

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Yeah, professional.

228
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,800
And actually, this is a wonderful way of setting up your idea.

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
So the teacher said that it's an important aspect of understanding the legal system was

230
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,560
understanding its origins or its genesis.

231
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,880
And then she moved on and said that it's not enough to simply memorize laws.

232
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
That's right.

233
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,240
It's not enough to simply do something.

234
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Okay.

235
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,040
So the beginning of this sentence, it is not enough to simply something.

236
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,760
By starting a sentence like this, you are indicating that more is required, right?

237
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,440
So here, it's not enough to simply memorize the laws.

238
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,100
We're saying that most people just memorize the laws, but they need to go further.

239
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,240
And understand them.

240
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Exactly.

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,520
Another example would be, it's not enough to simply pass your exams.

242
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,200
You must get good grades as well.

243
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Right.

244
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,860
Or maybe in a business context.

245
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,700
It's not enough to simply satisfy your customers.

246
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,160
You must impress them.

247
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Okay.

248
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Very good.

249
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,040
So that's a very good way of starting out this idea of more is required.

250
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
That's right.

251
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
More is required.

252
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
All right.

253
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
All right.

254
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,280
Well, I want to move on to one final point here.

255
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,200
I found this sentence to be really, really interesting.

256
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,200
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

257
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Okay.

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
So why is this interesting?

259
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,880
Well, I found that, you know, there's two verbs going on here.

260
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,480
They passed a resolution that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

261
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,760
So we've got two verb times going on here at the same time.

262
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,840
And I'm wondering about this one would.

263
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Okay.

264
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,440
So what's happening here?

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
Obviously this happened in the past.

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
It's like about a hundred years ago, right?

267
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Right.

268
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,080
So the resolution was passed a hundred years ago.

269
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Right.

270
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,480
So this is going on in the past.

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Right.

272
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,320
But there was a future action that was going to happen in consequence of this.

273
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Right.

274
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,200
So the resolution stated that eight hours would constitute.

275
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,220
So that's like the primary action was the passing of the resolution.

276
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,360
And the result is this sort of this event that happens in the past, but is a future

277
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,680
event to the first primary event.

278
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,800
Does that make any sense at all?

279
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
So this is called the future in the past, right?

280
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
That's right.

281
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Okay.

282
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
So it's a grammar structure.

283
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,000
Many of you maybe know the simple present or the future tenses, but this is a little

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
strange one.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,760
As we said, so maybe it's a little bit difficult to understand the grammar in general.

286
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,200
So why don't we take a look at some more examples of how we would use this future in the past.

287
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,080
Example one.

288
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:08,120
The president said that he would cut taxes by 5%.

289
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Example two.

290
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,040
I made a promise that I would not smoke anymore.

291
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Example three.

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Carl told me he would buy a new car.

293
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,900
Okay.

294
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,920
So now I think it's clear this whole idea of the future in the past and well, we'll

295
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,240
also be answering any questions on the site if you have any problems, right?

296
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
That's right.

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Okay.

298
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk

299
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:50,760
about this holiday, which is the International Workers' Day.

300
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
All right, everyone, settle down.

301
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Let's get started.

302
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,320
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis

303
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,440
of our legal system.

304
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,660
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

305
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,680
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

306
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,760
This brings me to our topic for today.

307
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,840
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

308
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Cinco de Mayo.

309
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,960
No, that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

310
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,320
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

311
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,560
No, May 1st is International Workers' Day.

312
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,880
Do we get a day off from school then?

313
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
No.

314
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,400
It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it

315
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
is.

316
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Man.

317
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,240
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work

318
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,760
10, 12, and 14 hours a day.

319
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,020
Support for the eight-hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference

320
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,800
and hostility of many union leaders.

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,320
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

322
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,960
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers

323
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,800
took drastic measures.

324
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,540
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

325
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,560
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

326
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Cool.

327
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,880
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

328
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Yes.

329
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
But the happy ending came at a high price.

330
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,840
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works

331
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,720
factory, killing four and wounding many.

332
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,640
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

333
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,080
And then what happened?

334
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,440
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

335
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:48,200
All right, so Erica, in Canada, do you celebrate this?

336
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,600
We do, but not on May 1st.

337
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Oh, really?

338
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
When is it?

339
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
The first weekend in September.

340
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Oh, really?

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
And why?

342
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,240
Um, I am not 100% sure.

343
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,600
I think it's because we already have a long weekend in May, because on the 24th of May

344
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,800
is Queen Victoria's birthday, so we have to celebrate that.

345
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Oh, really?

346
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,760
So you have two vacations in the same month.

347
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Oh, wow.

348
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,080
Well, yeah, I mean, it's not productive, right?

349
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Exactly.

350
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
What about in Ecuador?

351
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Yeah, we do.

352
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,720
On May 1st, it's a holiday, and we actually have two holidays in May as well, because

353
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,120
on the 24th, we actually celebrate the Battle of Pichincha, which is one of the decisive

354
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,680
battles for the independence of Ecuador.

355
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,920
So we don't mind having two holidays in the same month.

356
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,440
Well, it sounds like Ecuador has a better holiday schedule than Canada.

357
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,240
So yeah, on May 1st, people take vacations, and our companies usually on May 1st will

358
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,120
do something special for their employees.

359
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,920
Oh, that's kind of a nice gesture, isn't it?
