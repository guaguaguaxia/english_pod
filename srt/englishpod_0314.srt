00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco. My name is Catherine and

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,400
today we're making a phone call. That's right, we are making a special type of phone call.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,160
We're making a collect call. So, we will explain what this means. Let's listen to the dialogue.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:33,880
See if you can more or less guess what a collect call means and we'll be right back.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,520
This is the operator. How may I help you? Yes, I would like to make a collect call.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:57,960
Okay sir, please dial the number. Now, please state your name. Tommy. Please wait a moment.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,240
Hello, you have a collect call from Tommy. Would you like to accept the charges? Yes,

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,640
of course. Dad? Yeah, Tommy. What happened? Are you okay? Yeah, dad. Everything is okay.

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,040
I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for me to go to my friend's house

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,680
today after school. Yeah, sure. No problem. You scared me to death. I've told you to make

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
a collect call in case of an emergency only. Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,240
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the pay phone. Sorry, dad.

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,800
Alright, so we're back. We've got a number of words and phrases to look at. Let's check

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,840
out our words in Language Takeaway first.

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Language Takeaway.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,120
Alright, so as we mentioned, we are making a collect call. So what exactly is a collect

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
call?

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,200
Alright, well a collect call is a phone call you make when you don't have any money and

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,080
the phone company charges the person who answers the phone.

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Okay.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,560
So if I call my mom with a collect call, my mom pays.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Not you.

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Not me.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,120
And you can do this pretty much from any phone, right?

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,520
That's right. You can do this from any phone. Normally people use pay phones to do this.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,140
But there is one condition that is important with the collect call. The person who answers

27
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,800
the phone, they have to say that it's okay that they pay. You can't just use this with

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
anybody.

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,120
Okay, very good. So actually when the guy was making this collect call, the operator

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,520
asked him to dial the number.

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,240
Okay, so this is an important verb that we have with making a telephone call. You make

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,040
a call, but with the number, the phone number, you actually have to dial it.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
And that comes from those old phones where you don't push the numbers, you pull them.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
Yeah, you have to spin the little wheel.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,020
Yeah, there are circles and you pull the numbers and spin the wheel around. But the verb now

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,760
is to dial a number.

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,200
To dial a number. That's right. Okay, so you dial your number and well actually as we said,

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,480
you're making this collect call because maybe you don't have any money. In this case, sometimes

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,640
in your mobile phone, you have what we call credit.

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,680
This is an important word. This is a noun. You have it or you don't have it. On my phone,

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,080
for example, I have a lot of credit. But maybe if I don't have any credit, I run out of credit,

42
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,960
I don't have any money left, I can't make a phone call.

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,160
That's right. So this is what it means when you have credit in your phone. It means that

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,040
you have some money with the telephone company. So when you make a call, they discount it

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
from there. But if you don't have any more credit, you can't make any phone calls.

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,880
Exactly. So basically credit represents money.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,320
That's right. Okay, and as you said, a collect call, you usually make it from a pay phone.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
So what is a pay phone?

49
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,960
Okay, well, we have phones at people's houses. Those are regular phones. And we have cell

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,520
phones which you can carry around. Well, pay phones are public phones that you have to

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,480
use money in order to make a call on.

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Okay, so usually you will see these at airports, for example.

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,720
Airports, train stations, any big public place where people need to use phones. They're less

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,600
common now in some places. But basically, you have to put the coins, the money coins

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,040
into the phone to get the phone to work. If you don't have any money, you can't make a

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
call.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Yeah, that's right. Okay, so four key words there. Why don't we take a break and listen

58
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
to the dialogue again.

59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:42,640
This is the operator. How may I help you?

60
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,120
Yes, I would like to make a collect call.

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,080
Okay, sir. Please dial the number. Now, please state your name.

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Tommy.

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,440
Please wait a moment.

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Hello, you have a collect call from Tommy. Would you like to accept the charges?

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
Yes, of course.

66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Dad?

67
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Yeah, Tommy. What happened? Are you okay?

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,640
Yeah, Dad. Everything is okay. I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for

69
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,040
me to go to my friend's house today after school.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Yeah, sure. No problem. You scared me to death. I've told you to make a collect call in case

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,080
of an emergency only. Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,800
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the payphone. Sorry, Dad.

73
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,400
All right, now we're going to talk a little bit more about the phrases we found in this

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
dialogue on Fluency Builder.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Fluency Builder.

76
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,640
So this first phrase is a phrase that you might encounter in many different situations,

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,320
but today's situation is making a collect call. So we heard this phrase, please state

78
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
your name.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,400
That's right. So you have a verb here, to state your name, state your age, and that

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,520
basically means to tell us, tell me or tell us what is your name.

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,480
That's right. So if I say, hey, you, state your name.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,760
That means I have to say my name, Marco, for example.

83
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,880
So you can use it for name, for age.

84
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes. State your birthday, please. So this is often what we have to do when we're on

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,480
the phone with a service company. So the bank will ask us, what is your, you know, state

86
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,440
your birthday, please, or state your last name or state your phone number. They want

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
to confirm our personal information.

88
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Okay. And well, as we heard it, so once you do all this, you make a collect call. The

89
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,560
person on the other side has to accept, and this is when the operator said, would you

90
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,760
like to accept the charges?

91
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,840
In this case, to accept the charges means to offer to pay. Okay. So if you accept the

92
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,080
charges, that means that the phone company will ask you for money when your bill comes.

93
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,720
That's right. So you accept to be charged with money or you accept the charges that

94
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
come with this telephone call.

95
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
That's right.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,280
And now the dad finally says, are you okay? You know, is everything all right? And apparently

97
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,280
it was a very trivial thing. He just called to make sure that he can go to his friend's

98
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,560
house and the dad said, you scared me to death.

99
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Okay. Parents often use this phrase in English. This means you had me very worried. I was

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
so worried. So you scared me to death. That doesn't mean that the father died.

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Right.

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,320
It means he was very, very, very scared.

103
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,760
Right. Exactly. So it's a phrase a little bit, obviously with exaggeration, but very

104
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,520
common to hear. You scared me to death. You scared me a lot.

105
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Yes.

106
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,240
And why did he scare him to death? Because he told his son to make a collect call in

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,760
case of an emergency only.

108
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,520
Okay. So this phrase in case of an emergency is a fixed phrase. You can see this on the

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,820
metro, you can see this on the bus, but also you can hear this in conversation. And so

110
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,520
in case of an emergency means only when there is an emergency situation, a fire, an accident,

111
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
something like that.

112
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,680
That's right. Maybe on a train you have seen or on an airplane, you have a big red button

113
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,160
or a lever that says pull in case of emergency.

114
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
That means don't pull it now, but pull it if there's a serious problem.

115
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
That's right.

116
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,640
So the father says, you know what? I told you only make a collect call in case of an

117
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,040
emergency. That means if there's an accident, if the boy's in the hospital, if there is

118
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,480
something serious happening, then it's okay to charge to make this collect call. But other

119
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,880
times like, you know, you forgot your wallet. That's not an emergency.

120
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,560
Yeah. All right. Very good. So why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll

121
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
be right back.

122
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:07,040
This is the operator. How may I help you?

123
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,560
Yes, I would like to make a collect call.

124
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,720
Okay, sir. Please dial the number. Now, please state your name.

125
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Tommy.

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,880
Please wait a moment.

127
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:33,960
Hello. You have a collect call from Tommy. Would you like to accept the charges?

128
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Yes, of course.

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Dad?

130
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Yeah, Tommy. What happened? Are you okay?

131
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,080
Yeah, Dad. Everything is okay. I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for

132
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,400
me to go to my friend's house today after school.

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,120
Yeah, sure. No problem. You scared me to death. I've told you to make a collect call in case

134
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,880
of an emergency only. Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

135
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,360
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the payphone. Sorry, Dad.

136
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,640
So making a collect call, very common thing as well. This is the scenario you will find

137
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,320
in the United States, for example, if you go to a payphone, you don't have any money,

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,040
you want to call your friend, the tour guide, the airport, anything, you can make a collect

139
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
call.

140
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,720
That's right. And this is something that is, like I said, becoming less common with cell

141
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,400
phones. But generally speaking, if you don't have any money and you have an emergency situation

142
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,000
or you need to call someone, it's very important, then you can make a collect call. You dial

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,840
O for zero for the operator and you say, I want to make a collect call. And they will

144
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,040
ask you these important questions. And then what the other person hears is, you know,

145
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,840
Catherine would like to make a collect call.

146
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Right, exactly.

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,240
Will you accept the charges? And you know, if you're my mother, you'll say yes, of course.

148
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,640
That's right. Now, as you said, payphones, they used to be all over the place and you

149
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,800
would have to put in a quarter. This is why the kid said that he didn't have any money

150
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,600
for the payphone. But now you don't really see too many payphones. Everyone's got mobile

151
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
phones.

152
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,960
That's right. And payphones are less and less common, although a lot of people like to use

153
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,320
payphones just because they're private, not tracked.

154
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,000
And yeah, but what I found is that the airports now, you can't use a payphone with quarters

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,640
or money. Now you got to use a credit card to use a payphone.

156
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,080
That's right. It's become so expensive that you have to swipe your credit card to use

157
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,080
the payphone. So it's a changing world, Marco.
