1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Hello everyone and welcome to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,320
And I'm Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson all about life with a roommate.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
That's right.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,760
So sometimes during college you have to live with a roommate because living alone is too

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
expensive.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,200
Also, after college I know that a lot of people who are just starting their jobs often live

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
with a roommate to save some money.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
That's right.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,560
Or maybe your girlfriend could be considered kind of like your romantic roommate.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,360
I hope not in the sense of today's lesson.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
We're talking about problems with a roommate.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,200
So let's listen to this dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,920
Charlie, do you have a second?

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Yeah, what's up?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,840
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly I think it's unfair.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Unfair?

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Why?

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,400
Well, you have long hair and use the hair dryer every morning.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
I don't.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,440
I don't.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,960
You see what I'm getting at here?

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,320
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,320
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,640
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,080
Maybe you should move out.

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,100
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,160
So we have a couple of different words that we're going to take a look at now in Language

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,760
Takeaway.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,020
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,000
So the first word is a dreaded word that means that most people don't like it.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
They fear it.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
This is bills.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
That's right.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,440
You have to pay your bills.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,080
So a bill is the paper that tells you how much you have to pay.

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
That's right.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
So you can have a gas bill.

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,560
An electricity bill.

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,280
A cable bill.

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,680
Or even at the restaurant, you ask for the bill.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,560
All right, so this is the amount of money you need to pay.

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
That's right.

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,120
And usually at the end of the month, you receive many, many bills in the mail and you have

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,920
to pay the companies like the gas company and the electricity company.

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
That's right.

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
So those are bills.

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,520
A singular would be a bill.

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,760
And so this is how the argument starts.

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,600
The two roommates decide that they have to pay the bills, but they don't want to split

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,960
the bills in half, go halves.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,680
They have to pay their own.

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,440
And so one person says, listen, this isn't fair.

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,240
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,960
Okay, so we understand what it is to download something or you download this podcast, but

61
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,240
a torrent, what is that?

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
That's kind of technical.

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
That is.

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,280
So a torrent is a kind of file that you can download from the internet.

65
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,120
So basically when you want to download a movie or some music from the internet, you go to

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,240
a website that will connect you to someone who owns this movie or book or music and they'll

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,080
have a special file that's called a torrent file and that's what you download.

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
That's right.

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,200
So it's a new way of downloading files off the internet from many people, kind of like

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,880
a peer sharing.

71
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
That's right.

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,440
So when one person disappears or goes offline, it shares you with another person.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
That's right.

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,680
So those are torrents.

75
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,720
And now, well, they kept arguing about you have to pay this, I have to pay that.

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,840
So you said, you know what, you should just move out.

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,700
Ooh, so to move out, this is a phrase that has two words to move out.

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,960
It means to leave this house forever, this apartment.

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,600
So that means to find a new place to live.

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Right.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,880
So I can say, oh, I'm moving out this weekend.

82
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,560
That means I'm changing apartments.

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Right.

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Or my boyfriend just moved out.

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Okay.

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
That's really sad.

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,280
He left your house.

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Okay.

89
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,760
So that is to move out.

90
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,300
And now we have a word that is more colloquial of how to say a house or an apartment.

91
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
This is place.

92
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
Okay.

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
So you just say a place.

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,480
So place normally is a location.

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Okay.

96
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
Where is this place?

97
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,720
But we could say, hey, we're going to have dinner at my place.

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Would you like to come?

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,400
So that means we're going to have dinner at my house.

100
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Right.

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
My place, his place.

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
His place.

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,280
Or you have a really nice place.

104
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Thanks.

105
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Okay.

106
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
So that means you have a really nice house.

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Exactly.

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Okay.

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,640
So four key words today when we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a

110
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
little bit.

111
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,520
Charlie, do you have a second?

112
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,120
Yeah, what's up?

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,800
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

114
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,400
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly, I think it's unfair.

116
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Unfair?

117
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Why?

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
I don't.

120
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,880
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

121
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,040
I don't.

122
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,840
You see what I'm getting at here?

123
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,160
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

124
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,160
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,500
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

126
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,760
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

127
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,800
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,680
Maybe you should move out.

129
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,600
All right, we are back and we've got some great phrases today coming up in Fluency Builders.

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,440
Let's take a look at some of those.

131
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Fluency Builder.

132
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,360
All right, so the first phrase that we have, very common, very, very common, but also

133
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,760
very difficult for English learners to answer this question.

134
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,440
All right, what's up?

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
What's up?

136
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,960
So if somebody says, what's up, what does that mean?

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
That means what's going on?

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
What's new?

139
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
How are you?

140
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
How is it going?

141
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Okay.

142
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Hi.

143
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
So how should you answer this?

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,160
Okay, so think of what's up as being a question about what's new, what's happening.

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
You can say, what's up?

146
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,440
Oh, not much.

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Not much.

148
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,640
Okay, what's up means what's new?

149
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,840
Oh, not much is new.

150
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Not much.

151
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Everything is the same.

152
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
So what's up?

153
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,240
You could say, hey, hi, how are you?

154
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,680
It's another way to say hi.

155
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay.

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,400
But you can't say, this guy.

157
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,480
Right, or sometimes English learners will say, fine, thank you, because they think that

158
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,440
what's up means how are you?

159
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
No, that's different.

160
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,000
So you cannot say, fine, thank you, fine, well.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,680
These are words that answer how are you questions, but this isn't a how are you question.

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,760
This is a what's new question.

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
What's new or hi.

164
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,200
Okay, so somebody says, what's up?

165
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,580
You can say, not much, or you can say, hey, what's up?

166
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,200
You can say, what's up back?

167
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
What's up?

168
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
What's up with you?

169
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Yeah, what's up with you?

170
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
Okay, so that's our first phrase.

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,360
Now, when the guy was talking about the hair dryer and the computer, he finished off that

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
paragraph by saying, you see what I'm getting at here?

173
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,240
Okay, you're doing this.

174
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,160
You use the hair dryer, you leave the computer on.

175
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,760
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

176
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,880
First phrase, do you see what I'm getting at?

177
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,520
It means, do you understand what I'm talking about?

178
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,120
Do you see my point?

179
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,960
That means I haven't said exactly what I mean, but you should understand what I'm saying.

180
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,480
So he's saying, you're wasting electricity.

181
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,320
You use all of these services more than I do.

182
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,600
And we could say, maybe Marco didn't get a good grade in his English test last week.

183
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,520
I say, listen, maybe it has to do with your study habits or how much you love video games

184
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,840
or how little time you spend at school.

185
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,240
Do you see what I'm getting at?

186
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
Okay, so you're not saying directly that I don't study.

187
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,160
You're just telling me the reasons, maybe why as to why I'm not studying.

188
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Like a hint.

189
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,680
Okay, so that's what you say when you don't tell somebody directly what the problem is.

190
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,840
You say, you see what I'm getting at here?

191
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,040
Do you see what I'm getting at?

192
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,920
Getting at means hinting.

193
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,200
Okay, and our last phrase, when they kept talking about the bills, one of the person

194
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,080
said, you are using way more gas and water than me.

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,360
So what about this way more?

196
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,040
Way more.

197
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,440
Way means much or a lot.

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
So we could say, you are using a lot more water than I am.

199
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,640
Or you're using way more water.

200
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,920
This is very spoken language.

201
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
This is not written language.

202
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
So don't write this down on your tests.

203
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,960
But way more means a lot more, much more.

204
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,520
Okay, you can say, Bob is way more attractive than Bill.

205
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
That's right.

206
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,120
Or this is way more interesting than that show.

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Okay, so you can say way more instead of much more or a lot more, but it's usually spoken

208
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
English.

209
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Exactly.

210
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,200
All right, let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit to

211
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,920
talk a little bit more.

212
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,200
Charlie, do you have a second?

213
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah, what's up?

214
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,600
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

215
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

216
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,000
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly, I think it's unfair.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Unfair?

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why?

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,760
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

220
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,880
I don't.

221
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,640
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

222
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,780
I don't.

223
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,320
You see what I'm getting at here?

224
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,680
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

225
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,640
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

226
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,220
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

228
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,280
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

229
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Maybe you should move out.

230
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
So Marco, have you ever had any of these problems with a roommate?

231
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,920
I've actually stayed away from roommates because of issues like this.

232
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,000
You mean you have not had many roommates because you're afraid of this situation?

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,480
Yeah, I've always actually tried to live on my own by myself, like in a small apartment

234
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,360
or studio, or if I have to have a roommate, maybe just one, not a house full of roommates.

235
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,640
Because I think the more people there are, the little bit more complicated it gets.

236
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
And if it's just two, it's a little bit simpler.

237
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,340
This is true, although sometimes I think it depends on the people that you're sharing

238
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,440
a house with.

239
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,080
I've had one awkward experience where people did not want to pay ever, and they were always

240
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,320
late with their payments, and one situation where people were very good about it, so always

241
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,400
remembered and were very helpful.

242
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
So it really depends.

243
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,960
Yeah, I think it's hard to live with someone always, of course.

244
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,020
Even if you start living with your girlfriend or boyfriend or you get married, it's kind

245
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,120
of different to live with someone.

246
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,880
And especially money-wise, I think it always complicates things with people.

247
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Definitely.

248
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
So I think you're right, though.

249
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,720
If there's two people, it's very easy to share the bills.

250
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,120
But if there's five people or six people, it's very hard to find out who spent more

251
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,360
money or what the rules are.

252
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,240
Yeah, so it can get a little bit complicated.

253
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,200
But I'm sure a lot of our listeners have probably had roommates before, maybe in college, maybe

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
even now.

255
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,200
So let's hear those experiences and maybe those good and bad stories about living with

256
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
other people.

257
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,880
So please get in touch with us.

258
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,040

260
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
We hope to see you there, and until next time.

261
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Bye.

262

Thank you very much.
