00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,900
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,960
And today we're talking about money issues.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
That's right.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,080
So there are some really interesting phrases and we're going to learn a little bit about

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,160
how money and social security works in the United States.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,080
But before we get into that, why don't we look at vocabulary preview?

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,560
So we're talking about retirement and that means we're going to talk about when you stop

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,960
working when you're 63 or 65, how do you save money for that?

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,680
And the phrase we've got here is retirement plan.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
All right.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,560
So a retirement plan.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,440
So as you say, that's some money that you have for when you retire, when you're 65,

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,240
when you're too old maybe to work.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Exactly.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,400
And there are many different kinds.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,640
We're going to hear about one that's called a 401k.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,320
But we'll talk about that in a minute.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,640
First let's listen to today's dialogue.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For sure.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,440
about social security in the US.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Like what?

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,920
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,360
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,720
to save and invest for their own retirement.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,880
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,600
paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,120
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,960
on your nest egg.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,940
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,280
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government run retirement fund, but most

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,760
people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,440
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,640
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
institutions.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,200
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,480
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,320
Alright we're back from today's dialogue.

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,200
Now some really interesting words and phrases there.

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,960
And as you said, this 401k, what is a 401k?

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,040
Well I'm not sure about the details, honestly, but the 401k plan is a plan for workers, people

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,840
who are young and working, to invest in their retirement.

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,720
And so it's a way to save money.

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,400
So every day they put a little bit of money towards this plan and in the end when they

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,840
retire they will have a certain amount of money that they can use throughout their seniorhood.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Exactly.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,040
And so before we have that, we have this conversation which starts with a documentary.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,040
So they're learning about 401ks.

54
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,760
And in this case, the person says that they didn't understand a lot because there was

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,200
a lot of technical jargon.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,480
Alright so this word jargon, jargon, it's very similar to slang, right?

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Exactly.

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,360
And it's a special kind of talking or special words related to a certain topic.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,600
Or a certain industry.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,480
For example, you hear a lot of business jargon, right?

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,600
Or marketing jargon.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Yeah, when people start talking about POPs and POS and all that jargon.

63
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I lost you, sorry.

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
No, I don't get that.

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,080
Well jargon then is a special language for a certain industry or field.

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,440
And in this case we're learning about financial jargon and investment jargon.

67
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,840
So we're talking about 401ks and funds and all that stuff.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,240
Okay, very good.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,640
And now when they were talking about the 401k, he explained how they deduct money to put

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
into this plan.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,320
Well, the question is who deducts money and where does it all go?

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
And so to deduct means to take away.

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,120
And this means in a 401k plan, the government will deduct money from your paycheck and put

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,800
it into a special savings plan for you that you can access when you're retired.

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,680
Okay, so to deduct means to take away, to take out, right?

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Exactly.

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
So subtract, deduct, take away, take out.

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Very good.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
All right.

80
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,520
And as they kept talking about money issues, the woman said that people in her country

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,120
distrust banks and financial institutions.

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,200
Okay, so you might recognize a word there, distrust, trust.

83
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,620
They have the same root.

84
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,840
And so to trust someone is to believe in them and to believe what they say.

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,400
But to distrust means to think what they're saying is a lie.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,640
Okay, so you don't really believe that person.

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,840
No, so if someone says, trust me, I will take your money and I won't spend it.

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,960
You say, I distrust this person.

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,680
That means I don't trust.

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
Right, very good.

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,400
And well, why do they distrust these institutions?

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,200
Because the government is a bit corrupt.

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,160
Okay, so you hear this word a lot in the news or in the newspaper.

94
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,480
You can have a corrupt government or a corrupt politician.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,640
That means that the government does things but says it doesn't and maybe is dishonest.

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
It's distrustful.

97
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,660
Right, so for example, a corrupt politician will support a law that's not really good

98
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,360
but maybe he's being paid by somebody else.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,440
Or a corrupt politician will take money from the government institutions to use for himself

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
and not for the country or the people.

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
That's right.

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,280
So it's a corrupt, corrupt government then.

103
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Okay, very good.

104
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,080
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back soon with Fluency

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Builder.

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,160
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
For sure.

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,640
about social security in the US.

110
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Like what?

111
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,520
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

112
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,280
Yeah, I know it sounds weird but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,320
to save and invest for their own retirement.

114
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,800
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your

115
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,520
paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

116
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,040
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully

117
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
on your nest egg.

118
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,840
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

119
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,200
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,040
people don't really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.

121
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,080
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

122
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,560
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial

123
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,920
institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

124
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,120
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

125
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,440
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
Alright, we're back.

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
So on Fluency Builder, we're going to look at three phrases.

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
So let's look at them now.

129
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Fluency Builder.

130
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Okay, this first phrase is what the entire dialogue is about.

131
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,760
It's about putting away money.

132
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,000
So to put it away.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
Okay, so to put money away.

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,240
That's an equivalent of saving, right?

135
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
Exactly, to save.

136
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,880
So in this case, to put away is a fixed phrase.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
These words, they go together very often and it means to save.

138
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,440
So you could say, oh yeah, last year I put away a thousand dollars.

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,920
Okay, so you saved a thousand dollars.

140
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Exactly.

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Very good.

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
And why are we putting all this money away?

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,600
We're trying to build a nest egg.

144
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Now this is a funny phrase.

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
It is funny.

146
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
A nest is a home for a bird.

147
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,360
You know, it's made of sticks and twigs and leaves.

148
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,720
And a nest egg then has to do with a bird's egg.

149
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Eggs in the nest.

150
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Well, I don't know.

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,120
I don't know where it comes from, but it does mean money that you've saved up for some date

152
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
in the future.

153
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
So you could say, I'm trying to grow a nest egg.

154
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm trying to build a nest egg so that in 10 years I can buy a house.

155
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,940
Okay, so it's not only for retirement.

156
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,360
You can build a nest egg to possibly invest it in the future into buying a house.

157
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Exactly.

158
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
It's your savings that you don't touch.

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,000
So I could say, I'm going to kill you.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,240
You spent the nest egg.

161
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
That's not for spending.

162
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
It's for saving.

163
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
All right.

164
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,820
And well, where can you save money for your nest egg?

165
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,360
It's very popular to put it in a piggy bank.

166
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,520
Well, maybe if you're five years old, but I don't know if I'd put a lot of money in

167
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
a piggy bank.

168
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,960
A piggy bank is usually a ceramic pig, you know, and it's got a hole in the top and you

169
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,840
can put coins in the top.

170
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,880
So we give these to children to teach them how to save.

171
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,320
So they can put one penny in every day.

172
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,120
And then when they need the money or they want to spend it, they break the piggy bank.

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Exactly.

174
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,680
You have to throw it on the ground.

175
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
And it's sad because you realize, oh, now I don't have my piggy anymore.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Lost my nest egg.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All right.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again?

179
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:18,720
Let's keep a lookout for all these words and phrases and we'll be back shortly.

180
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,840
Well that was an interesting documentary.

181
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
For sure.

182
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,320
about Social Security in the US.

184
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Like what?

185
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

186
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,200
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,240
to save and invest for their own retirement.

188
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,720
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your

189
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,440
paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

190
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,960
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,800
on your nest egg.

192
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,780
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

193
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,120
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,960
people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

195
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,200
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

196
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,480
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial

197
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,880
institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

198
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,040
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,880
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

200
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:40,160
Alright, we're back.

201
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
So this whole savings thing, are you good at saving?

202
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,120
Do you have your nest egg planned out for your retirement?

203
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,200
Nest egg, no, but I'm a compulsive saver.

204
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Really?

205
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I like to save a lot.

206
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Oh, wow.

207
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
Yeah, because you never know when you're going to need money.

208
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,160
And I think once you get a kind of an adult job, you know, the nine to five job, it's

209
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,060
important to spend as little as possible so that you can create a nest egg or some kind

210
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,800
of savings account for the future because it'd be nice to have a car or a house someday.

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Right, right.

212
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,560
And also, as you say, unexpected things happen.

213
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,400
So something may happen.

214
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,240
Maybe you break your arm and you don't have any savings or maybe no insurance.

215
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,840
So at least you have some money stashed away where you can use it.

216
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Exactly.

217
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,160
And I know that in America right now, in the news, the credit crisis is very popular to

218
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
talk about.

219
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,840
And so part of this economic situation is that people owe more money than they have.

220
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,620
That means they've spent more money than they own.

221
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,960
And so they don't have any savings.

222
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
And that really scares me.

223
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,920
So I think it's a really smart idea to start investing as soon as you can.

224
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Very good.

225
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
All right.
