00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,960
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,720
And today we have a very advanced lesson for you all about medicine.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,720
That's right.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,920
Today we're going to take a look at what is very widely known as Chinese traditional medicine.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,320
So a very interesting topic in general.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
That's right.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,840
And for people who use this, they might call it TCM, traditional Chinese medicine.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,280
So remember that there's that acronym as well.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,760
But let's take a listen to today's dialogue and when we come back, we'll be discussing

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:41,040
some of the important words and phrases in the dialogue.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
What's wrong?

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,480
I have a headache.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,000
These past few days I've been living off painkillers.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,240
Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
You should get acupuncture treatment.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,200
My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
The results are too slow.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,440
On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
They don't just randomly stick you.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
They find your pressure points.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,440
The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body's qi.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,480
But I get scared the moment I see a needle.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,840
How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
The needles are very thin.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,280
And as long as the doctor's technique is good and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
hurt.

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,000
On the contrary, it will actually alleviate pain.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Now there are high-tech needles that are micro-thin.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
They don't hurt at all.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,720
However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,520
Scraping is too terrifying.

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,000
When they finish scraping, your body is all red as if you were just tortured.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Cupping is the same.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,880
Your body ends up with red circles all over it.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
It looks like someone beat you up.

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,480
This only signifies that the toxins have left the body.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,240
Actually, there's only discomfort during the treatment process.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Once it's over, you'll feel very comfortable.

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,520
Chinese medicine is strange.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
The patients are already ill and then the doctor makes them suffer more.

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,920
This is the only way to get at the problem.

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,080
Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, you are just going to have to be tough and do

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
it.

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Forget it.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,280
I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,040
In a little while, I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,240
All right, we're back.

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,340
So now obviously we are talking about what is commonly known as alternative medicine

51
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:28,040
because we know that traditional medicine nowadays is doctors, you have antibiotics,

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
that sort of thing.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,180
And here you're actually using these techniques and these different ways of curing someone.

54
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,120
So the first thing that comes to mind here is acupuncture.

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
That's right.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,000
So acupuncture is usually considered a part of Chinese medicine and it's a kind of medicine

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,900
that uses needles in different parts of the body.

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,100
So it might look really scary because you see people lying on their stomachs with needles

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,180
coming out of their backs.

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,280
And the places where they put the needles in, they're called pressure points, right?

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
That's right.

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,140
And pressure points are things that we talk about with massages as well.

63
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,180
So a good masseuse, a person who does a massage, will also look for these pressure points,

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,520
which are key points on the body.

65
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,500
And in acupuncture, they'll put these needles into those points as well because each point

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,420
relates to a different part of the body, like the liver or the kidneys.

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Right.

68
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,440
So it's actually very interesting, the fact that by sticking a needle in one of these

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,040
pressure points, they are curing or alleviating the pain of maybe, like you say, your kidney

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,300
or your liver or something like this.

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,340
This is a really great word though, Marco, the word that you just used, to alleviate

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,680
pain.

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,060
Now to alleviate pain means to make the pain go away.

74
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,020
So we heard the opposite of that as well, also at the very end of today's dialogue.

75
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,600
So the opposite of alleviate would be to inflict pain.

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,580
This is to do pain to yourself or to someone else.

77
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
To cause pain.

78
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
To cause pain.

79
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,920
So to alleviate is to take it away and to inflict is to cause.

80
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,700
So now acupuncture is very popular.

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,480
Sticking needles in people's pressure points, it does seem like it would hurt, but there

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,680
are other ones that maybe are not as widely known.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,440
The next one that we're going to talk about is scraping.

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Scraping.

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:32,520
So to scrape is a verb and you can scrape the bottom of your plate with your spoon or

86
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,600
you can scrape on, you know, sometimes cats like to scrape on the furniture.

87
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,580
They use their claws and make that sound.

88
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,600
But in this case, scraping is a little bit more maybe painful sounding.

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,420
What do they do in scraping?

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,200
So basically it's the same thing.

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,080
They use different tools and they scrape your body.

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,720
They just, I don't know, basically what I understand from it is that they are extracting

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,160
the illness by taking it out of your skin.

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,360
So they use what looks like a small knife or like a flat kind of sharp blade.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
And they actually kind of take off the top layer of your skin.

96
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,840
They scrape it away.

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,360
It's very, very painful from what I've heard.

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,120
I've never done it myself, but as we see in the dialogue, it does look very, it looks

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,160
like you've been hit or treated poorly at the prison or something because your skin

100
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,380
is red and almost bleeding.

101
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,380
That's right.

102
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
And another one that actually looks quite painful when you see someone after they've

103
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,040
done it is called cupping.

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Right.

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,520
Now, this one you might have seen even in the last Karate Kid movie.

106
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:57,480
Basically it's a little round bulb or a little round glass cup and the doctor, the Chinese

107
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:06,120
doctor will light a piece of cotton and will put the cup over it and the suction effect

108
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,760
that by putting out the fire and it sucks up all the oxygen and everything causes the

109
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,760
cup to suck onto your skin really, really tight.

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,520
You put it on your skin so it creates a vacuum, right?

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Exactly.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
There's no air coming in.

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,240
And that way the cup that there's no air in has to pull out all those chemicals and those

114
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
toxins and that oil from your skin and take it away.

115
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Right.

116
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Right.

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
So it's actually pulling at your skin.

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Yeah.

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,360
And well, that's the thing with the vacuum effect is so great and pulling it out with

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,800
such force that you're actually left with a big purple or red circle on your skin from

121
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,400
I guess the blood clot type thing that is caused by it.

122
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
So you will see a person's back maybe and they have bruises.

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Bruises.

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Yeah, like six, seven, ten bruises on their backs.

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,480
Although I am told that even though it's very painful and it looks even more painful, the

126
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,040
effect is that it does help your circulation.

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,680
It helps the blood in your body move around more freely.

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah, I've heard the same thing.

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,720
And even though that it looks painful and it may be painful while they're doing it,

130
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,680
I've heard that after it's done, even though it looks like it should hurt, it looks like

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,340
a bruise, it doesn't hurt like a bruise.

132
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,440
So people don't actually say, oh, you know, don't touch my back.

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
It really hurts.

134
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
It doesn't really seem that way.

135
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,360
Well, and there's an interesting line in the dialogue that is related to this.

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,820
It's about scraping actually, but you can say it about cupping as well.

137
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,720
Your body is all red as if you were just tortured.

138
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,400
Now as if you were tortured or we could say as if you were beaten up.

139
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
And in this case, was the person tortured?

140
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
No.

141
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:04,760
It's basically a relation or making that relation that your skin is so, let's say bloody that

142
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,480
it looks as if you were tortured.

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
So it seems like somebody hit you with a whip or something.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,560
It looks like you were tortured, but you weren't.

145
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
So as if is a way for us to make a comparison or an analogy.

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Right.

147
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I think you can see it in maybe books, you know, so maybe you would describe a guy saying,

148
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,600
oh, he was really angry as if he had rabies.

149
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,360
Yeah, it's as if he had rabies like he doesn't, but he's acting like he does.

150
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,320
Or maybe you run into the kitchen and eat so much food as if you hadn't eaten in days.

151
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Exactly.

152
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,720
So you have obviously, but you're acting like someone who is starving.

153
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,680
So yeah, that is an interesting way to describe or to make a connection between two different

154
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
things.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,440
And well, Chinese traditional medicine as well, a very interesting and historical form

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
of treating illnesses.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,440
Now I'm told that it does work, even though some people are very skeptical about it.

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,040
And I don't think it's accepted in the international medical field.

159
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,680
Well, I think that there's a Western medicine which has its benefits.

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,320
You know, you have penicillin and all of these different antibiotics to help us combat different

161
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,520
diseases and bacteria.

162
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,360
But also traditional Chinese medicine kind of helps other things.

163
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,520
I think there is a spirituality, this idea that we have a chi, there are positive and

164
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,960
negative forces in our bodies, and sometimes trauma or big events will make that chi kind

165
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,120
of, well, it'll affect it in a bad way.

166
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,240
So the chi is unbalanced.

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,480
And so a lot of this is about rebalancing your system.

168
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
And if you believe that and you really understand that there are certain forces inside your

169
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,320
body, then I'm sure this kind of medicine has a positive effect on you.

170
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Right.

171
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,040
I believe that it does have its ups and downs.

172
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,440
I was very skeptical about it until once, actually, I had a very, very bad headache

173
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,040
and somebody took and pushed a pressure point on my finger, on my thumb for about maybe

174
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,640
one or two minutes and the headache was gone.

175
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,720
So I was very much amazed.

176
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,160
But at the same time, when people are treated maybe for, you know, maybe they can conceive

177
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,840
a baby and they're doing these rituals or giving them ginger or different roots to drink

178
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
and eat and stuff.

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,720
I don't know if that really does help or what evidence there is that it actually does work.

180
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,400
Well, I think that's something that also is important to look at on an individual basis.

181
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't think even some Western medicines help all the time if you're not in a place

182
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,760
where you believe that it will work.

183
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,640
But the interesting aspect of it is, of course, so many years ago, we're talking about hundreds

184
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,920
or thousands of years ago, when there was no Western medicine and then people were being

185
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,800
cured and treated by these techniques, which actually worked.

186
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,640
So there is a very interesting aspect that maybe even Western medicine can learn from

187
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
traditional medicine like this.

188
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Definitely.

189
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,520
So it's an interesting topic, Oriental medicine, Western medicine, but we want to know what

190
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
you think about it.

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,720
We also want to know in your home country, do you have a traditional kind of medicine

192
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,120
or any medical alternatives to Western medicine?

193
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
Let us know, our website is EnglishPod.com.
