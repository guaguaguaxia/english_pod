00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,400
My name is Katrin and we're shoe shopping again.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
That's right.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,160
We are going shoe shopping but this time it's a little bit more complicated because we're

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,260
getting women's shoes.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,260
That's right.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,280
So there are so many different kinds of women's shoes.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm not even sure I know them all myself but in this intermediate level lesson we're going

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,100
to cover some of the basics for you.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,100
That's right.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,800
Before we jump into this dialogue we have a word that we want to preview with you today

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,920
and let's take a look at it now on Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,960
Okay, so we're shopping today for a certain kind of shoe.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,200
It's not a sports shoe.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,680
It's a dress shoe.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,200
Okay, that kind of doesn't make sense because a dress is a noun.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,560
A shoe is a noun and so you want to get a shoe that's a dress?

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
No.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,000
A dress shoe is a style of shoe.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,200
It means shoes that you wear when you're wearing fancy clothes.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,800
So it's kind of like a formal shoe.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,720
A dress shoe is a type of shoe that would go well with a dress.

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,680
That's right, not sneakers.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,800
But don't be fooled.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,120
This is not about dresses because men can wear dress shoes too.

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
That's right.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,080
It means shoes you would wear to a conference or to a wedding or to church.

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,520
So these are things that are a little bit fancier than everyday shoes.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,200
Okay, awesome.

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,720
So we're shopping for a dress shoe and there are so many types and styles of shoes for

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,760
women so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back in a

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
second.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Hi, excuse me sir.

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,160
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
They don't provide any support anymore.

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,520
Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for?

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,320
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,600
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,760
Show me some classic high heels please.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,680
Okay, right this way.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,440
What color did you have in mind?

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,880
Black, classic.

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Of course.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,180
We've got this style here that is very popular.

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,560
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200
It'll look great on everyone.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,800
Um, too shiny.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,240
Okay, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel so they are very

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
comfortable.

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,440
I don't like the pointed toes.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,840
Let me take a look at what else you have.

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,900
Too high.

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,680
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,440
I have a high instep so I doubt that one would fit properly.

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,520
I don't want bows.

60
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,080
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,960
Those might as well be stilettos.

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Too modern.

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Ah, finally!

64
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
This is what I'm looking for.

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
What size?

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,520
Seven and a half.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,600
Here we are.

68
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
How does it fit?

69
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
Mmm, not good.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,560
They're too tight.

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,280
The length is right but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,960
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
You know what?

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,640
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,880
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,520
I'll come back another time.

77
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,280
Have a nice day, ma'am.

78
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Alright, we're back.

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,960
So a lot of shoe styles as you noticed, a lot of them are very, I don't know, I don't

80
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
even know what they are.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,440
So why don't we try and explain them now on Language Takeaway.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,600
Language Takeaway.

83
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,480
So the first kind of shoe we've got here is very popular in the summer.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,960
It's called a strappy sandal.

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
A strappy sandal.

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,200
So we know what a sandal is.

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,400
It's kind of like what you wear to the beach.

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,040
It's a shoe that doesn't really cover your whole foot, just the bottom.

89
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,840
It's very open.

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,880
And well, what about strappy?

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,320
Strappy comes from the word strap.

92
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,800
So strap is like a thin piece of fabric or leather that connects other pieces.

93
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,600
And so a strappy sandal means that it's got many of these different little straps on it,

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,880
many lines everywhere that connect it.

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,200
So it's very open.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,320
It's made of many different thin pieces.

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Okay, good.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,160
So we have a strappy sandal, basically a sandal with many straps.

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
And well, she went on to describe sleek high heels.

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
So this is a two-part thing here.

101
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Sleek is an adjective which basically means really cool looking.

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,200
Or more like it's pretty and fancy.

103
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Usually sleek things are also kind of simple, like a Jaguar is a very sleek car.

104
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,920
And so this is the adjective to describe the high heels.

105
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,360
So we have high heels.

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,120
We have high heels that are kind of fancy shoe.

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,600
Basically these are shoes that are not flat.

108
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,520
So the heel is very tall.

109
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
That's right.

110
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,940
So basically this is what a lot of women wear with dresses.

111
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,040
Basically the heel has a piece that kind of sticks out and makes the woman look taller.

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,040
So basically it's like they're walking on the tips of their toes the entire time.

113
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,080
Right, and they make click, clack, click, clack.

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,220
They make that sound.

115
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,320
But there are different kinds of heels.

116
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,880
High heels obviously means that they're tall.

117
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,120
You can have low heels too.

118
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
Those are shorter.

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,720
But high heels, there are different kinds.

120
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
One kind is pumps.

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Pumps, okay.

122
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,040
In the dialer we actually saw the salesman describe them as edgy pumps.

123
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,640
So edgy, what does edgy mean?

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,880
Edgy means cool or hip.

125
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,320
So young people like to wear edgy clothes, like rock and roll kind of clothes.

126
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,600
Not so much older people.

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,440
And pumps are a type of high heel you say, but what is the difference?

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,920
Well pumps basically are the kind of simple heel that a woman will wear with a pantsuit

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,840
or with a skirt to the office.

130
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,280
And so they usually have a closed toe and they're quite simple heels.

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,360
Okay.

132
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,800
And the opposite or maybe a little bit different from pumps would be stilettos.

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,120
So stilettos are a very special kind of heel.

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,640
Stiletto.

135
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,160
It refers basically to the difference in the back of the shoe where you have the heel.

136
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,200
Because sometimes heels are kind of thick and heavy and they make the clunk, clunk sound.

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,720
And stilettos are very, very, very thin and very, very tall.

138
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Okay.

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
So stiletto heels.

140
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,560
I think it's probably easier to walk with pumps rather than stilettos, right?

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,200
Stilettos are famous for being very, very hard to walk in.

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,040
It's almost like the back of your heel is a chopstick.

143
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Wow.

144
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
I cannot imagine doing that.

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Alright.

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,720
So this is the classification of our high heels.

147
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,880
Why don't we move on now to Mary Janes.

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Okay.

149
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,560
So we've got high heels and heels.

150
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
We also have flats.

151
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,580
These are flat shoes.

152
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,800
So one important kind of flats is a Mary Jane.

153
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Sounds a good name.

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Yeah, it is a name, right?

155
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Mary Jane.

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Mary Jane.

157
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
So what type of shoe is this?

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,520
This is basically a, usually a leather shoe, but it can be different materials.

159
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,320
And it's round in the front and it has one strap and they're very cute.

160
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Okay.

161
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,400
Usually little girls wear Mary Janes, but they're pretty popular these days with older

162
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
people too.

163
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Ah, okay.

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
So they're round in the front.

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,080
They are usually black and they have one little strap that goes over the top of your foot.

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Mary Janes.

168
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Okay.

169
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Alright.

170
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
So we've taken a look at Mary Janes.

171
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,160
Now moving on to, I think it's a similar type of shoe, ballerina shoes.

172
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,200
Well, ballerina shoes are similar because they're flat, but that's about it.

173
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
Ballerina shoes are very, very thin.

174
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,000
They're very, very weak.

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,380
And usually they're pretty simple.

176
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,200
They're pink or white or black and they're almost like a slipper.

177
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Okay.

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
So they don't have the strap on top.

179
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,320
No, they're stretchy and you just slide them onto your foot.

180
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,680
It's named after dancers, ballerinas, you know, the dancers who wear pink and they put

181
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,440
their hair up and they spin around and they're not hard on the bottom.

182
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,800
They're usually quite soft and they're always flat.

183
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,160
So maybe these ballerina shoes, they're not the specific types of shoes for dancing if

184
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,720
you're a ballerina.

185
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,320
But maybe they're more adequate for maybe walking around the house or something.

186
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,160
You don't really go out hiking with ballerina shoes.

187
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,720
No, you don't go out hiking, but they're very popular to wear now to school or work.

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Okay.

189
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,440
And the other type of shoes that we had, actually this was really confusing to me, slingbacks.

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Slingback shoes.

191
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,200
Well, slingbacks can be hard because they can be heels, they could be pumps, but it

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,680
basically refers to a part of the shoe.

193
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,760
So normal shoes, they cover the back of your foot, but slingbacks have one strap in the

194
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
back.

195
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,480
So maybe if I look at my foot in a slingback, I can see part of my heel.

196
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Right.

197
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Okay.

198
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,640
So slingbacks have a little strap on the back of your heel since the shoe doesn't close

199
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
in the back.

200
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Right.

201
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Okay.

202
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,120
But you also have high heels and women's shoes that don't close in the back, but that you

203
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,040
don't have a strap in the back either, right?

204
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
Those are open shoes.

205
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,840
So yeah, they're open in the back, but a slingback, there's one strap that keeps your shoe on.

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Okay.

207
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,360
A lot of different types of shoes we've just taken a look at.

208
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,280
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly with Fluency

209
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Builder.

210
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,200
Hi, excuse me, sir.

211
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

212
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,200
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

213
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
They don't provide any support anymore.

214
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Sure.

215
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,600
What kind of shoe are you looking for?

216
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,360
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

217
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

218
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
Show me some classic high heels, please.

219
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Okay.

220
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Right this way.

221
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,360
What color did you have in mind?

222
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Black.

223
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Classic.

224
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Of course.

225
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,080
We've got this style here that is very popular.

226
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,440
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

227
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,360
They look great on everyone.

228
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
Um, too shiny.

229
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,480
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

230
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Okay.

231
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,920
These are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

232
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,280
I don't like the pointed toes.

233
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,680
Let me take a look at what else you have.

234
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,720
Too high.

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,480
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

236
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,720
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

237
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,120
I don't want bows.

238
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,640
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

239
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
Those might as well be stilettos.

240
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Too modern.

241
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Ah, finally!

242
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,840
This is what I'm looking for.

243
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
What size?

244
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,280
Seven and a half.

245
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Here we are!

246
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
How does it fit?

247
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,600
Hmm, not good.

248
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
They're too tight.

249
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,760
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

250
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,440
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

251
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
You know what?

252
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,240
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

253
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,960
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

254
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,720
I'll come back another time.

255
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,840
Have a nice day, ma'am.

256
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:30,880
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at five key things on Fluency Builder.

257
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,520
Fluency Builder.

258
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay, well the reason we're shopping today is because the woman needs a new pair of shoes

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,200
because her old shoes can't be worn anymore.

260
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
What's wrong with them, Marco?

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,480
She said that they were stretched out of shape.

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,520
Okay, so to stretch or to be stretched out, this means that maybe they've been pulled

263
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:59,080
and worn and they're stretched so much that they don't have the original shape anymore.

264
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Right.

265
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,120
So just imagine you have a new t-shirt and all of a sudden somebody takes you from your

266
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,600
t-shirt and pulls you really hard.

267
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
And usually what happens is this t-shirt is going to be stretched out of shape.

268
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,960
You pulled it so hard that it loses its original form.

269
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,280
So now maybe the neck is very low or the t-shirt is too long on one side.

270
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,120
So that's what happens when you stretch something out of shape.

271
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Great.

272
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,760
So her old shoes are stretched out of shape and they don't provide support anymore.

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,960
So to provide support.

274
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,080
Now what kind of support is she referring to?

275
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,860
She's talking about foot support.

276
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,160
So for example, slippers are a kind of shoe basically that don't provide support.

277
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
They're very soft.

278
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
But can you walk around all day in slippers?

279
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
No.

280
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,680
It doesn't help your foot.

281
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
But if you're trying to find shoes that are really good for walking, you need to find

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,420
ones that provide support.

283
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,640
That means that always support your foot, the bottom of your foot.

284
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,280
Otherwise your foot gets too tired.

285
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,880
Not only the bottom but it could be also your ankle.

286
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,040
For example, you can't really go hiking with shoes like these with sandals because obviously

287
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
you're walking around rocks and it doesn't provide support on your ankle.

288
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,280
Maybe you can hurt your ankle if you don't have it.

289
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,320
So maybe a hiking boot will provide more support.

290
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Exactly.

291
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Alright.

292
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,400
And then the woman also mentioned that it's hard for her to find a shoe because she said

293
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,240
I have a high instep.

294
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay so think about the foot.

295
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,320
You've got toes in the very front and a heel in the very back but in the middle on top

296
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,860
you have the instep.

297
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,840
So this is basically the top of your foot.

298
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Okay.

299
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,040
So if she has a high instep, it means that her foot is kind of thick.

300
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
That's right.

301
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Some people have thin feet.

302
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
She has kind of a thick foot.

303
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,120
So fitting her foot into a shoe is sometimes hard.

304
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Right.

305
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,700
We're not talking about the width of the foot.

306
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
We're talking about the height.

307
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Like how tall.

308
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
How tall it is.

309
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,240
From the bottom to the top of the foot.

310
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Right.

311
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,180
So that's what she means by high instep.

312
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,360
And well they also mentioned different types of shoes.

313
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
She said she didn't want an open toe shoe.

314
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,600
She wanted a closed toe shoe.

315
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
That's right.

316
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,760
So this is a really important classification for women's shoes especially.

317
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,320
Open toe means that the toe of the shoe, the very very front, has a hole or an opening.

318
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,160
So you can see the toes.

319
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Right.

320
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,500
Closed toe is the opposite.

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,240
So personally in the winter time I always wear closed toed shoes because I think open

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
toe shoes are too cold.

323
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Too cold.

324
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Okay.

325
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
So that's basically it.

326
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,280
I guess men, we don't really have this type of shoe between open toe and closed toe.

327
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
No.

328
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Maybe.

329
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
No.

330
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
You don't really.

331
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,080
But heels maybe you could have an open toe.

332
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,320
You can have an open toe shoe or closed toed shoe.

333
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Right.

334
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Right.

335
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Okay.

336
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
So a lot of interesting things.

337
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,360
This is useful for women out there and also for boyfriends.

338
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,840
Maybe now you know what type of shoe your girlfriend may want.

339
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
That's right.

340
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Alright.

341
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,440
So we're going to listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back shortly.

342
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Hi.

343
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,120
Excuse me, sir.

344
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

345
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,880
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

346
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,240
They don't provide any support anymore.

347
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
Sure.

348
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,520
What kind of shoe are you looking for?

349
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,280
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

350
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,320
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

351
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,800
Show me some classic high heels, please.

352
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Okay.

353
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,640
Right this way.

354
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,400
What color did you have in mind?

355
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Black.

356
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Classic.

357
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Of course.

358
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,120
We've got this style here that is very popular.

359
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,520
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

360
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,360
They look great on everyone.

361
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,760
Too shiny.

362
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,320
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes.

363
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
So let's look for a closed toe shoe.

364
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Okay.

365
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,600
These are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel.

366
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
So they are very comfortable.

367
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,400
I don't like the pointed toes.

368
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Let me take a look at what else you have.

369
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,840
Too high.

370
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,640
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

371
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,400
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

372
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,480
I don't want bows.

373
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,040
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

374
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,920
Those might as well be stilettos.

375
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Too modern.

376
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Ah, finally!

377
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
This is what I'm looking for.

378
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
What size?

379
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,480
Seven and a half.

380
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,560
Here we are.

381
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,680
How does it fit?

382
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Not good.

383
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
They're too tight.

384
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,240
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

385
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,920
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

386
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
You know what?

387
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,640
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

388
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,920
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

389
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,520
I'll come back another time.

390
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,120
Have a nice day, ma'am.

391
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:06,680
All right, so talking about shoes, there are so many types and I think women are notoriously

392
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,760
famous for having a lot of shoes.

393
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Why is this?

394
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Some women are.

395
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Some women aren't.

396
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
It depends on the person.

397
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Part of the problem, as you said earlier, is that there are so many different kinds

398
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,120
of women's shoes that now we expect women to have a different pair of shoes for every

399
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
different occasion.

400
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:31,040
Work shoes, hiking shoes, running shoes, wedding shoes, summer shoes, winter shoes, fall shoes.

401
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,360
You need so many different kinds of shoes, you end up buying many different kinds.

402
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,800
I think that's true.

403
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Also basically, women like to look nice.

404
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,680
That's why you do your makeup, you have earrings, and they have nice bags.

405
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,520
So I guess it's also part of it is that you pay more attention to what type of shoe you're

406
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
wearing that maybe goes well with the outfit.

407
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,560
I think maybe guys, not all guys obviously as well as not all women, but guys are a little

408
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
bit more generic.

409
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,200
It's like jeans pretty much go well with any type of shoe as long as it's maybe black or

410
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,680
brown or something like this.

411
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
True.

412
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,240
Although I know a lot of guys who have many different kinds of shoes.

413
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
True.

414
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,480
It takes up a lot of space in the closet as well.

415
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
It does.

416
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,880
Shoes are hard to carry around.

417
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
And actually I find it kind of hard to get rid of my shoes.

418
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,880
I think they have to be ripped or just completely unwearable in order for me to throw a shoe

419
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,640
away because otherwise you can still wear it sometimes on the weekend.

420
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
That's true.

421
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Although I tend to wear my shoes down.

422
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
That means I wear them until they die.

423
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Really?

424
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
And then I throw them away.

425
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,120
Actually I've had shoes that I've worn the soles down and then I just get the sole changed

426
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,680
because I like the shoe so much.

427
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,200
Well, let us know.

428
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,160
Do you guys like to buy shoes?

429
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Do you have a lot of shoes?

430
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,800
Maybe you don't have that many shoes.

431
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,880
We're curious to know about this in other cultures as well because I know in the States,

432
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
in the United States, shoe shopping is very, very popular.

433
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,920
In Holland they have traditional wooden shoes.

434
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Yeah, they do.

435
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Those are called clogs.

436
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Clogs.

437
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,280
So let us know maybe what type of shoes are also very unique to your country or culture.

438
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
We're at EnglishPod.com.

439
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
We'll see everyone there.

440
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Bye.

441
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,680
Thank you.
