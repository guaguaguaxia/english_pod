00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,600
And my name is Kathryn and it is the holiday season.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,320
That means we're talking about Christmas and Christmas shopping.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,880
We've got a great lesson for you today.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
Exactly.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,640
So we're going to be looking for a Christmas gift and so let's listen to our dialogue for

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,400
the first time and we'll be back to explain some words.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:35,960
Bill, Bill, you've got to help me.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
What's wrong?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm such a bad son.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,920
Take it easy.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,840
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,000
That's just it.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,160
I don't know what to get her.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,200
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
small.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,360
I suck at getting presents for people.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,280
That's where you're making a big mistake.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,640
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,020
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,040
love her.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,560
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,960
that she would really like.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,800
Yeah, you're right.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,240
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeah, tell me about it.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
I know.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,920
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,840
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod?

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,800
Now that's a great idea.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,160
Alright, we're back.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,240
So now, why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,800
Okay, so there are a lot of interesting words in this dialogue.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,760
Some of them have to do with Christmas and some of them have to do with shopping.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,200
So this first one has to do with neither.

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
It's actually a phrase.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,120
It's a medical term.

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Right.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,600
He talked about a heart attack.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,920
Okay, so you know what a heart is, but a heart attack is when there's no more blood going

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,320
into your heart and your heart stops beating.

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,560
It's a very, very dangerous situation.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,000
So the person actually said this because the other guy was like, Bill, Bill, you got to

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
help me.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He was all very excited.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
He was like, whoa, whoa, slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
So it's not literal, right?

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,200
Yeah, it's not a real heart attack.

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,240
He's saying, calm down.

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Calm down.

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Okay.

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Alright.

57
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,040
And well, he was very upset because he hadn't bought a gift and he said, I suck at getting

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,520
presents for people.

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,760
I suck at getting presents for people.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
Well, suck is not a very polite word.

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,120
My mom used to get angry at me when I used it, but it's a way to say that I'm very, very

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,880
bad at doing something.

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,320
Okay, so I suck at playing tennis.

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,560
Alright, or you can say, I suck at math.

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Alright, but again, this is not something you should use on a test or in an essay because

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,640
it's very spoken colloquial English.

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,080
Right, exactly.

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
And this other word is actually okay to use and when you're talking about presents or

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,560
you're talking about decorations, you say something is tacky.

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,480
Okay, well, if you call something tacky, this is an adjective, so something is tacky, it's

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,080
really a matter of opinion.

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,520
Okay, so I think this is tacky, but you don't.

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,920
Maybe that's a problem.

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,080
So let me give you an example of tacky.

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:41,280
I think that clothing with lots of bows and glitter and shiny things are very tacky.

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,360
Okay, so it's something that you don't really like.

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,320
So you think that is a little bit strange.

78
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
That's right.

79
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,560
So as you say, it's an opinion because you think that clothes with bows and teddy bears

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,720
on it is tacky.

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
Well, somebody else can think, no, it's cute, it's nice.

82
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Exactly.

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,320
And you can also describe things that people do as being tacky.

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,160
So for example, he gave me a present but he left the price on it.

85
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, that is so tacky.

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,320
Right, that is tacky.

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,360
Alright, so the word is tacky.

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,380
And moving on, we talked about a gift certificate.

89
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,840
You should get your mom a gift certificate.

90
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,080
Well, a gift certificate is a very popular form of gift giving now.

91
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,800
You know what a gift is, but a certificate is a piece of paper.

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,920
Okay, so you could have a birth certificate, for example, it says when you were born, where

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,100
you were born.

94
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,600
But in this case, a gift certificate is a piece of paper that you give someone to say,

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,300
you have this much money to spend at this store.

96
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,440
So I could give my mom a gift certificate for a bookstore for $50 and she can go with

97
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,680
this piece of paper and spend $50 for free because I already paid.

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,440
So it's kind of a very popular thing to do because sometimes, as in the dialogue, you

99
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,440
don't know the person's size or you don't know if they like this color.

100
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,360
So you're just like, look, here's a gift certificate for $100, go to the store that I know you

101
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,760
really like and get yourself whatever you want, something nice.

102
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,320
But it's less tacky than giving that person cash, right?

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Right.

104
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,680
Cash is considered a tacky gift.

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,160
I'm not really sure why, it just is.

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,960
It's a social custom, but very popular right now are these gift certificates or even gift

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
cards.

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
They look like credit cards.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Very good.

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,960
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll return shortly to take a look

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,640
at Fluency Builder.

112
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Bill Bill you gotta help me.

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
What's wrong?

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,040
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,320
Tomorrow's Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

116
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm such a bad son.

117
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
Take it easy.

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,520
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,640
That's just it.

120
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,840
I don't know what to get her.

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too

122
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
small.

123
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,080
I suck at getting presents for people.

124
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,960
That's where you're making a big mistake.

125
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,320
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

126
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,720
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you

127
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
love her.

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something

129
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
that she would really like.

130
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,480
Yeah, you're right.

131
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,960
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,280
Yeah, tell me about it.

133
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
I know.

134
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,600
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod?

136
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,200
Now that's a great idea.

137
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,280
Alright, we're back.

138
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,920
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

139
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
Okay, I like this first phrase.

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Sometimes I have to use it about other people.

142
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Sometimes people use it on me.

143
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,000
You say, take it easy.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Take it easy.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hey, take it easy.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Relax.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, this is a way to say, hey, be calm.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Be calm.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
So there's no, you can't really translate it, right?

151
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,420
Take what easy?

152
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,640
You can't, but this is, there are two main contexts, okay?

153
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,680
There are two situations where this is really popular.

154
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,040
One is this, oh my God, Marco.

155
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
Oh my God, I'm freaking out.

156
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,400
I really need your help on this and I really need you to just really be involved.

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Take it easy.

158
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
All right, relax.

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Take it easy.

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Okay.

161
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,880
All right, so that's someone who's upset and you're telling them to calm down.

162
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,760
The second situation is when you're saying goodbye to someone.

163
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,000
This is a very kind of, again, spoken language, very comfortable way of saying, hey, see you

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
later.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So it's like, all right, bye.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Take it easy.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, take it easy.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Have a good one.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Have a good one is another good phrase.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Take it easy.

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That means, that means, yeah.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Take life easy.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't rush.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't rush.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Enjoy your life.

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
So if you try this with your English speaking friends, you're saying goodbye, you say,

180
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,280
hey, take it easy.

181
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Yeah, bye.

182
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Take it easy.

183
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Bye.

184
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
It's a nice one.

185
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Very nice.

186
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
All right.

187
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,840
And her second phrase is actually, it's interesting because when he talked about the ring that

188
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,080
he got for her mom that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

189
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,480
So the construction there, two sizes too big, five sizes too small.

190
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,200
This is a very important construction and it doesn't quite make sense when you hear

191
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
it.

192
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,320
So that's what we're going to explain right now.

193
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,520
Let me try to explain this using an example.

194
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,600
If I have a size seven shoe and my brother gives me a Christmas present of size nine

195
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,480
shoes, I say, Peter, these shoes are two sizes too big.

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Okay.

197
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,200
That's the number two, two sizes, T-O-O, too big.

198
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,440
That means they're too big for me by two sizes.

199
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Okay.

200
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,920
Because the difference between seven and nine is two.

201
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Right.

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,440
And if I have a size five shoe, I say, Peter, these shoes are two sizes too small.

203
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,840
That means that five is two less than seven.

204
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,080
So this is a very popular construction.

205
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,960
So you're saying specifically how much bigger or how much smaller the shoes are in the case

206
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,280
with the ring or shoes or anything that has a size.

207
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Exactly.

208
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,360
But the funny thing is you can also exaggerate.

209
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,240
You could say, oh, this sweater is so ugly.

210
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,640
It's 10 sizes too big for me.

211
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
It's not really 10 sizes.

212
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
It's not really 10 sizes.

213
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Right.

214
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
So, but you can use this construction, right?

215
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,400
Using one size too big, etc.

216
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,880
Even when you're buying something to the store, to the lady in the store, you can say, oh,

217
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,160
I think the shoe is two sizes too big.

218
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,080
Can you give me a smaller pair?

219
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Exactly.

220
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
All right.

221
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,040
And our third phrase for today, when the person said, yeah, you're right.

222
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,720
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

223
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,840
So we looked at tacky, but what does he mean when it comes down to it?

224
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Okay.

225
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,640
Well, this it is very confusing sometimes when we talk about phrases in English, but

226
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:05,840
when it comes down to it as a way to say in reality or actually, or the truth is yes.

227
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,120
So it's a way to say something is truthful.

228
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Okay.

229
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
So I can say when it comes down to it, Catherine is a good friend.

230
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh, right.

231
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,180
So when times are tough or in the end, or actually maybe you have your small faults,

232
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
but you are a good friend.

233
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
Right.

234
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,960
And when it comes down to it, Marco is a really hard worker.

235
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,320
So sometimes he likes to play video games, but when it's a really important, he will

236
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
work really hard.

237
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Very good.

238
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,520
So very good uses of this phrase and you can use it in many different contexts.

239
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,900
And for our fourth phrase, when the person said, yeah, tell me about it.

240
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
What does it mean?

241
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Tell me about it.

242
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Tell me about what?

243
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Okay.

244
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,400
Well, this is a really very popular phrase.

245
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,120
You hear this all the time and it's, it's a way to say, yeah, I agree.

246
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
I understand.

247
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I understand.

248
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,560
So this is, this is a phrase that means agreement.

249
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Okay.

250
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,080
So I can say, God, I really hate winter because when I leave work, it's always really dark.

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah.

252
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Tell me about it.

253
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,120
It's always dark and it makes me feel lazy.

254
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Right.

255
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
And so Marco is agreeing.

256
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,640
He says, I don't like it either.

257
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Yeah.

258
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
So this is a very, very spoken way, spoken language way of agreeing with someone.

259
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,400
So you say, yeah, tell me about it.

260
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Right.

261
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
It's very natural.

262
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,440
It's a very natural way of agreeing with someone.

263
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Right.

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Exactly.

265
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
All right.

266
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
So great phrases.

267
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,680
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a

268
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
little bit more.

269
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:44,600
Bill, Bill, you gotta help me.

270
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
What's wrong?

271
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,040
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

272
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,400
Tomorrow's Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

273
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm such a bad son.

274
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,680
Take it easy.

275
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,560
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

276
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,740
That's just it.

277
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,900
I don't know what to get her.

278
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,800
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too

279
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
small.

280
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,080
I suck at getting presents for people.

281
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,000
That's where you're making a big mistake.

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,360
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

283
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,760
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you

284
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
love her.

285
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,280
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something

286
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
that she would really like.

287
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,520
Yeah, you're right.

288
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,000
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Tell me about it.

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,080
I know.

292
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

293
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,520
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod?

294
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,840
Now that's a great idea.

295
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,680
All right, great.

296
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,600
So now that the Christmas.

297
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
All right.

298
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,640
So as we said, gift certificates are a good idea, but what else do you like to give as

299
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,120
Christmas presents?

300
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,560
Personally, I like things that people really think about and spend their time doing or

301
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,760
making.

302
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,040
So I like, for example, my mom is a beautiful quilter.

303
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,080
She makes these big blankets and quilts them.

304
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,720
And sometimes she even quilts names of people and stuff.

305
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,240
And so those are really wonderful gifts because the person thinks about you and who you are

306
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,720
and what you want.

307
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,440
And so I like to be able to give gifts like that, but I'm not necessarily that creative.

308
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,840
So I think it's nice to give gifts like tickets to a music show or things like that where

309
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,640
you know the person will go and have a good time and enjoy themselves.

310
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,120
Yeah, I think that's really important because sometimes people just give gifts because you

311
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
have to.

312
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Stuff.

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Yeah, like stuff.

314
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
And you're like, oh, great.

315
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
A tie.

316
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
It's kind of impersonal.

317
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,680
At the same time, if your dad or your boyfriend or somebody loves ties and has 50 of them

318
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,240
and you get them another one that's really interesting or unique, then great.

319
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,080
But it is good to take the time to get somebody something they really like or they would really

320
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,720
use or enjoy.

321
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Exactly.

322
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,760
So what kind of gifts do you plan to give this holiday season?

323
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
Do you celebrate Christmas?

324
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
Let us know on our website EnglishPod.com.

325
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Right.

326
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
We'll see you guys there.

327
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
And until next time.

328
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Bye.

329
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:32,280
Cheers
