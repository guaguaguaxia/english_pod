00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,840
My name is Catherine and today we have an advanced level lesson for you guys all about

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
food.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,680
What kind of food are we talking about today, Marco?

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,520
Today we're talking about cheese.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,520
So there's so many different types of cheese, so many varieties.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
So we're going to take a look at these varieties.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,500
You may know them or not.

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,080
But we're also going to take a look at the pronunciation because most of them are either

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,800
Italian or French.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
So how do you pronounce these in maybe in American English?

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Good question.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,760
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back in a moment to talk

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,480
about the wonderful world of cheese.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,720
Hello everyone.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,200
My name is Lori and I want to welcome you to this course.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,480
We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet, cheese.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
Let's get started.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,480
Cheese is usually categorized into four types, soft, semi-soft, semi-hard, and hard.

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,960
The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese which directly affects its texture.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,200
Making cheese is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years and the home cheese

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,360
maker can usually find recipes for cheese that fall into any of the four categories.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,920
Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, blue, roquefort, mozzarella,

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
muenster, and similar cheeses.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,160
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats and can be used as breakfast cheeses

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,520
in an omelet or as pasta fillings.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,320
American, Colby, Kojak, and similar cheeses are in the semi-soft category.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,960
These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses.

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,680
Kojak cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack, is one of the most popular.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,200
This allows the sharper flavor of the Colby to be combined with the milder Jack cheese

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,160
and also melts better than plain Colby.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,840
Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese and Mexican cheeses such as asadero

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,880
and queso fresco are becoming more popular.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,080
Hard cheeses include parmesan, romano, asiago, swiss, gruyere, and others.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,400
Parmesan and romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,000
are also used as a companion mince for fruit, wine, nuts, and other appetizer items.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,080
Alright we're back, so obviously this is a very interesting lesson because it also gives

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,720
us an insight on how cheeses are categorized.

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,640
I personally did not know that you had all these categories of cheeses.

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
Starting out with the soft cheeses.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,320
That's right, so basically they're broken into these soft, semi-soft, semi-hard, and

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,880
hard categories.

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,320
The soft cheeses are the ones that are actually, you know, you could touch them and they're

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,080
soft, they kind of move under your finger.

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,040
And the famous ones I think are cottage cheese, which is almost like yogurt.

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,720
Yeah, and cream cheese.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,280
And cream cheese as well.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,880
But also ricotta, and brie, and roquefort, and mozzarella.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,720
So for example, these cheeses, they're usually, well they're obviously very soft cheeses.

53
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,080
Do you say cheeses or cheese, or chees-eye?

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,160
Yeah we just say cheese normally, or different kinds of cheese, so in that case you make

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,480
the plural kinds of cheese.

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,140
Types of cheese.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,720
So these kinds of cheese, they are recommended, or they say that they pair well with fruits

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
or meat.

59
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,200
So when we talk about pairing a cheese with fruits, or pairing a cheese with wine, what

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,960
are we saying there?

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,200
In that case we're saying that it's best to eat with certain kinds of food.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,920
So you can say, I would recommend pairing this red wine with lamb.

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,120
But in the case of cheese you could say, I would recommend pairing this delicious brie

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
cheese with fruit.

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,880
Okay, so you actually have brie with fruit.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,040
That's right.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,160
It's, well it depends on the kind of cheese.

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,640
A lot of times you see mozzarella on pizzas, and so it's not paired, it's actually a part

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
of the dish.

70
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
It's an ingredient, right.

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,140
But if you're going to eat a piece of cheese alone, you can have it maybe with some fruit.

72
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,280
So I guess that's the main difference between pairing and having it as an ingredient.

73
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,480
It's pairing, you're combining it, but it's not really part of the dish.

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,640
No, and as an ingredient it's actually, it has to be in the dish to make it work.

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,440
And so you have a lot of these delicious soft cheeses that you eat at breakfast, or sometimes

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,800
dessert, ricotta, cream cheese, these are all parts of desserts, like cheesecake for

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
example.

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Oh yeah, what do they use in cheesecake?

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Usually cream cheese.

80
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Oh really?

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Yeah.

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,280
But then you get into these other cheeses which are semi-soft or semi-hard.

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,000
And semi here just means part.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,400
So it's partially hard, partially soft.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,240
And these cheeses are different because you might use them sliced on sandwiches, things

86
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
like that.

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,140
In this category you have American and Colby, and Monterey Jack is also very, very popular.

88
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,440
So these actually do have a more American sound to it.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,720
The American cheese or Monterey Jack, that sounds a little bit different than all the

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,920
Italian or French sounding cheeses that we had in the soft ones.

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right, and you'd even have something like cheddar in this category.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There's another...

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Cheddar cheese.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, there's another good cheese.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
As you said, these are very typically put in sandwiches.

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,880
Yeah, I mean you can use them in different ways.

97
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,120
Sometimes we grate cheese, that means we rub it against this machine, a grater, to make

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,000
it come out in these little fine pieces.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,760
For example, on top of pasta or on top of nachos.

100
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,600
So we have grated cheese, but you can also have sliced cheese, and that's the way that

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,840
we cut cheese to put it on a sandwich.

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,760
So for example, if you go to McDonald's and you get a burger, usually the cheese that's

103
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,780
on your hamburger is cheddar cheese, right?

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,760
That's right, it's a slice of cheddar cheese.

105
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Okay.

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,080
So moving on to our next category, well actually towards the end of the different types of

107
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,480
cheese under the semi-soft category, they also talk about Mexican cheeses such as asadero

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,960
and queso fresco.

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,560
I love queso fresco.

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
You've had this before?

111
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,880
Yes, many times.

112
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,920
What do you usually have it with or how do you pair it?

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,520
Usually it's an ingredient on tacos because it's a little bit crumbly.

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,800
It's like balls as opposed to being one chunk, one big piece.

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,260
And so we usually have it like that or I've also had it as just a piece of cheese paired

116
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,040
with a fried plantain or sour cream.

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,320
It's actually very good.

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,360
The thing with queso fresco is all of the cheese, they also depend on how mature they

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,200
are, how long they've taken to make them.

120
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,720
And queso fresco means fresh in Spanish and this is the main factor in this type of cheese

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,480
that is very, very immature.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,920
It's a very fresh cheese.

123
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,240
You can make it in like a day or two.

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Exactly.

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,440
It just takes one night to sit and to become cheese basically.

126
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,040
But other cheeses, and we'll see some of these in the hard cheeses, take a very long time

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,560
to become their final cheese state.

128
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,400
And one of those cheeses is parmesan.

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,920
In Italy, when you buy parmesan, they have these big wheels of it, they're circles.

130
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,680
And you have to pay according to how old it is.

131
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Oh, really?

132
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,840
18 months, 36 months.

133
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,040
And it gets more expensive the older it is.

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,880
So obviously the older it is, just like wine, it has a more intense flavor.

135
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
That's right.

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,160
And there are special characteristics for certain ages.

137
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,280
Sometimes people really like the young ones.

138
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,600
It depends on your taste and what you're going to use it for.

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,400
But Romano is another cheese in Italy that's used like parmesan on top of pastas.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,440
So spaghetti, you would grate it and you put it on top of pasta.

141
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,320
What about, they also mentioned this other one, Asiago.

142
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,760
Asiago cheese, Swiss cheese is the one with the holes.

143
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,880
Asiago is, I don't know, maybe it's Spanish.

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,600
But then we have Gruyere, which is a French cheese and tends to be very, very, very strong

145
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
flavored.

146
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,880
And I think Gruyere is the cheese that usually many people use for making fondue.

147
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,600
So they basically have this big pot or this medium-sized pot and all the cheese just melts

148
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,120
and you just dip pieces of bread or vegetables in there and you eat this just melted cheese.

149
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Fondue, very popular dish in Switzerland.

150
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,560
That's right.

151
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,620
But yeah, all these different types of cheese, as you said, there are so many different types

152
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,440
and according to the age.

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Now you lived in Italy for a while and obviously they are a nation that enjoy having wine and

154
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,840
cheese very regularly, right?

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
That's right.

156
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,360
And I have to say that people in Parma take their cheese very, very seriously.

157
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
How serious?

158
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,440
Well, a lot of people buy these big pieces of parmesan cheese and they keep them in the

159
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,240
refrigerator and you don't just put the parmesan cheese on the spaghetti.

160
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,680
You also break pieces of it and you eat it alone with a glass of wine or some people

161
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:40,000
like to put a little drop of balsamic vinegar on top of the cheese to give it some flavor.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,280
So there are many different ways to eat it.

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,180
I'm sure it's different all over the country, but mozzarella, parmesan cheese, Romano, these

164
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,820
are all cheeses that are very, very important in Italian culture.

165
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,920
It's very interesting because, well, obviously we have listeners from all over the world,

166
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,960
but some countries have a good culture for wine, cheese and cured meats.

167
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,600
Like for example, in South America, if you visit Argentina or Chile, they are a nation

168
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,740
that actually have a lot of variety of cheese, wines and cured meats.

169
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,800
But if you take a trip to maybe Colombia, they're not really that type of culture.

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,960
They really consume cheese and wine in the same manner.

171
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Interesting.

172
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,360
I wonder if it has to do with the historical relationship between Europe and the place

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
like Argentina.

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,720
In Argentina, there's lots of Italian former people who came over from Italy many, many

175
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
years ago.

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,200
So that might have something to do with it.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,240
Spain has a very strong tradition of cured meats and cheeses.

178
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,600
They have manchego cheese, things like this.

179
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,520
So I wonder if there's a relationship there.

180
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,240
I think it's definitely an influence in some way.

181
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,640
But the thing with cheese, I think in many places it's very expensive.

182
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,000
It can be.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,120
Comparatively to if you can have a regular mozzarella cheese, but sometimes these other

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
types, they can be very expensive.

185
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,040
Yeah, it's like good wine.

186
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,480
If you really want to pay for good cheese, it's going to cost you a lot of money.

187
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Now what about this famous blue cheese?

188
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,160
We didn't mention it, but this is a very famous French cheese that basically has mold on it.

189
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Well, yeah, all cheese, you're growing cultures.

190
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,920
You're growing these things that are alive.

191
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,720
But blue cheese, you can actually see it.

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,960
And it's moldy.

193
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,240
It's white and there's some blue or green mold.

194
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
And some people love it and some people hate it.

195
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,800
I think it depends on your tastes, but it does have a very strong flavor.

196
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,240
Do you personally like it or dislike it?

197
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I do not like blue cheese, but I love other kinds of cheeses like camembert, which is

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,280
a French cheese with a very strong flavor, very stinky cheese.

199
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,880
So it's not necessarily that it's strong.

200
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,120
It's just that I don't like the taste very much.

201
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Okay.

202
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,840
Actually, it's very popular to put on salads, right?

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,760
Blue cheese sauce or a dressing.

204
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,080
Blue cheese dressing, yeah, that's right.

205
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
It's made out of blue cheese.

206
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,320
It's a very interesting topic and I'm sure that locally, many people also make or countries

207
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,680
have their own types of cheese.

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,120
I know for example, in Ecuador, we do have also something very similar to queso fresco

209
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
that's commonly used for breakfast.

210
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
And here's an interesting thing.

211
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
They put it in their cup of coffee.

212
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
No way.

213
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,360
It's cheese cheese, isn't it?

214
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,320
It's cheese.

215
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,760
So basically you have coffee with milk, very popular in Latin America.

216
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,480
And people will take a piece of cheese and put it in their coffee.

217
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,760
So obviously with the heat, it won't melt completely, but it will become very bendy

218
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
and very soft.

219
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,920
And then they'll have it with the coffee and the bread.

220
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,120
So it gives it a very interesting taste.

221
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,520
It may sound a little bit peculiar, but it actually has a very, very interesting taste,

222
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
very good taste.

223
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,240
I've had many friends try and they're like, wow, you wouldn't really think that you would

224
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
probably dip cheese in coffee, but it works.

225
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,800
No, it's a very unusual combination.

226
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,920
Now what is this special cheese called?

227
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,520
It's called queso de mesa, which is basically a normal, common, everyday table cheese.

228
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,280
So it's not any particular, it's very similar to queso fresco, very immature cheese.

229
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,760
So I'm very curious to know if in your country you also have a strong cheese culture.

230
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
And if in your country you guys do have a lot of cheese, what kind of cheese is it?

231
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,720
I know that every country has its own variety of cheeses and some places like China aren't

232
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
really into cheese.

233
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,520
So you can let us know if your country doesn't really have that many cheese options.

234
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,720
So we're very curious to hear about you and your taste in cheese.

235
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Let us know.

236
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
