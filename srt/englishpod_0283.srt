00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,320
My name is Katherine and as you've noticed on our website, we have a number of lessons

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,360
about giving a presentation in English.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
So this is one of those lessons.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Today we're talking about avoiding questions.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,200
That's right.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,880
Today in part five of our presentation series, we're going to try and handle some questions

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,100
or avoid questions as Katherine said.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,840
So why don't we jump into the dialogue.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:36,180
Let's see what Mr. Ford is talking about now and we'll be back in a bit.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,500
Now as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there, both in Asia,

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,140
in other developing markets and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,620
Now of course this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,780
But for any new product, we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,020
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer and needs to be pitched at

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,840
exactly the right level.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,240
The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly, what

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,340
do they expect from the next generation alpha laptop?

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,540
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,480
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle class white collar worker with an above average

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
income.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,020
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,300
and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,000
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector who might use

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,860
laptops both for studying and gaming.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,860
There's no doubt that...

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,920
Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,260
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,740
the X420 is just too much for most students?

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,100
Well that's a fair point.

32
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,660
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,660
Is that okay?

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Yes, sure.

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,900
Okay, so as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,460
Firstly we'll have a nationwide television campaign as well as advertising on radio and

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,820
also in many computer publications.

38
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,980
We also intend to...

39
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,540
I'm sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is

40
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,900
cost effective?

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,860
I mean, how much does that go into cost?

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,220
Well I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,100
you after the presentation.

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:29,180
Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.

45
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,260
All right we're back and now we can get started with Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,860
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,460
Okay so Marco, a lot of the conversation today was about markets and a target consumer.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,740
So perhaps we should start talking a little bit about who Mr. Ford thinks this company's

49
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,420
consumers are.

50
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
That's right.

51
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:59,580
He mentioned that the Alpha laptop could also be aimed at the middle class.

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,300
We have different classes in society, especially in America, where we talk about people who

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,020
are low income, they don't make very much money, or people who make a lot of money,

54
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,860
they're rich, they're on top.

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
That's the high class.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,940
Yeah, high class.

57
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,500
But in the middle, we have the middle class.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,060
And this is just average people.

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,820
They make money, they have a car.

60
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
They're not rich, but they're not poor.

61
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,660
Okay so they're in the middle.

62
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,180
So this is the middle class.

63
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,180
The computer is aimed at the middle class market, but he said that it's middle class

64
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,100
white collar worker.

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,380
Okay so I know this phrase exists in many other languages, but a white collar worker

66
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,780
in English means, refers to the color of the shirt that you wear.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,580
So white collar workers usually work in offices.

68
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
So because they're usually wearing suits.

69
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,100
That's right, they have to wear nice clothes like suits and button down shirts.

70
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,860
But we sometimes also talk about blue collar workers.

71
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,040
Who are these guys?

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,620
Blue collar workers are usually people that are in trades, like for example a mechanic

73
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,980
or a plumber, because usually you see them wearing those blue shirts.

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Yeah, uniforms.

75
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,820
They're usually people who work with their hands or who are not likely to work in a big

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
office.

77
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,100
So usually maybe these people are not middle class, maybe they are lower class.

78
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
They can be both.

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,900
In America right now I think you can make quite a bit of money if you're a plumber or

80
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,260
construction worker.

81
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
That's right.

82
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:31,060
But he also mentioned middle class white collar worker with an above average income.

83
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,100
Okay so an income is the amount of money that a person earns, usually in a year.

84
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,660
So we say $30,000 a year.

85
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,920
That's your annual income.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
That's right.

87
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,700
So when we talk about something that's average, that means it's normal.

88
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,900
But in this case we're not talking about something that's average.

89
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,060
What are we talking about?

90
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,500
It's above average.

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Above average.

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,740
So if the average income of a person in America is $36,000 a year, an above average income

93
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,140
is $70,000 a year or $65,000 a year.

94
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,980
But for the middle class maybe that's different.

95
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,740
So in the middle class an average annual income is $70,000.

96
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,700
An above average income in the middle class is $120,000 a year.

97
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,640
So the phrase there above average, you're just referring to something that's more than

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,200
the normal.

99
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
That's right.

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,880
So in this case more than the normal income for a middle class worker.

101
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,100
You can also say below average.

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,340
So a below average income is lower than most people earn.

103
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Okay.

104
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Very good.

105
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,420
And well continuing on talking about markets and the demographics, who were selling the

106
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,180
computer to, we also talked about our target consumer.

107
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,740
This is something that you often hear in meetings at work or in marketing departments.

108
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,260
A target is something you aim for.

109
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,140
It's something you want to hit or achieve.

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,700
And so a target consumer is the buyer, is a customer that you aim to have.

111
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Okay.

112
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,580
So maybe you have some customers that they're students and you have some customers that

113
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,780
they're very old, but your target consumer are the people that you really want to reach

114
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
out to.

115
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,340
In this case, the middle class white collar worker.

116
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,340
That's right.

117
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,540
So in the case of our dialogue, our target consumer is a middle class white collar worker,

118
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,540
for example.

119
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Okay.

120
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,140
So a lot of marketing stuff here talking about the computer and what Mr. Ford was saying.

121
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Let's take a pause.

122
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,980
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with some phrases on how to defer

123
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,740
questions.

124
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,940
Now as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there, both in Asia

125
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,700
and other developing markets and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

126
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,180
Now of course this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners.

127
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,340
But for any new product, we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

128
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,580
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer and needs to be pitched at

129
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,420
exactly the right level.

130
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,980
The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer?

131
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,900
And secondly, what do they expect from the next generation alpha laptop?

132
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,120
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

133
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,040
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle class white collar worker with an above average

134
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
income.

135
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,580
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly

136
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,880
and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

137
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,580
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector who might use

138
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,420
laptops both for studying and gaming.

139
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
There's no doubt that...

140
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,500
Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,860
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of

142
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,300
the X420 is just too much for most students?

143
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,680
Well that's a fair point.

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,260
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

145
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Is that okay?

146
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Yes, sure.

147
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,420
Okay, so as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

148
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,040
Firstly we'll have a nationwide television campaign as well as advertising on radio and

149
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,400
also in many computer publications.

150
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,540
We also intend to...

151
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is

152
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
cost effective?

153
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,420
I mean, how much does that go into cost?

154
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,760
Well I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with

155
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
you after the presentation.

156
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:33,320
Okay, let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.

157
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,140
Alright we're back, so now let's take a look at those phrases that we mentioned on Fluency

158
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,960
Builder.

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,880
Fluency Builder.

160
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,360
So Marco, there was a phrase that I heard twice in today's dialogue that I think we

161
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
should talk about.

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
The verb is to tackle, so we heard to tackle a question.

163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,420
Right, so when Mr. Ford says, I'll tackle that question a little bit later on, he's

164
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,520
talking about I'll answer the question or I'll talk about that question later on.

165
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Right, but in this word to tackle, there's something kind of physical about it because

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,200
in football we say that when someone tries to hit the ball from someone else, it's a

167
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
slide tackle.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And so to tackle a question means to really jump into it and try and solve it and it's

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,440
you know maybe not an easy question.

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,960
So I'm going to tackle that later.

171
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm going to tackle a challenge.

172
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
It's more than just to solve a problem or to answer a question.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
So maybe you can also tackle a project, a difficult project.

174
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
That's right, so you know what, I'm going to give us two weeks to tackle this project

175
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,080
because it's a very difficult one.

176
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
Alright, very good.

177
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,160
And well actually when he was getting some questions from the audience members specifically

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,240
because he was kind of being interrupted, he was very polite about it and to kind of

179
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,920
defer the question he said, you know what, that's a fair point but I'll tackle that question

180
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
later on.

181
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,280
Okay, and so this is a really great phrase if you want to flatter someone, make them

182
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,520
feel good before you tell them that you're not going to answer their question.

183
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,840
Or maybe you disagree with someone so I could say, you know what Marco, chocolate cake is

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,520
the only cake in the entire world that people should eat.

185
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,320
Okay, and I could say something like that's a fair point but in my opinion vanilla cake

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
is better.

187
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
Alright, so see what Marco did?

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,080
He made me feel good.

189
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:31,240
He said, you know, fair point, that's a good idea but I disagree or but in the case of

190
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,880
today's dialogue but we'll talk about that later.

191
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,640
Right, and actually he did another smart thing in the way that he used his language skills

192
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,360
here when he was interrupted again he said, hey, you know what, I'd be happy to answer

193
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,600
your questions at a later time or in the Q&A session.

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,720
Okay, so this phrase, I'd be happy to.

195
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,560
I'd be happy to talk about that at a later time but right now I'm trying to explain something

196
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
else.

197
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,520
Exactly, so these are two really, really key phrases for trying to in a nice way change

198
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,200
the topic or change the conversation.

199
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,280
So yeah, I guess you can say, yeah, I'd be happy to talk about that later on or I'll

200
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,280
tackle that question in a little bit or that's a fair point but we'll talk about it later

201
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
on.

202
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,480
Okay, so a lot of great language there.

203
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:32,720
Why don't we take a last listen to our dialogue and review everything we've just learned.

204
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
Now as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there both in Asia,

205
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,680
in other developing markets and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

206
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
Now of course this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners

207
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,320
but for any new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,560
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer and needs to be pitched at

209
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,400
exactly the right level.

210
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,800
The question we must first address is of course who is our target consumer and secondly what

211
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,880
do they expect from the next generation alpha laptop?

212
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,100
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

213
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,040
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle class white collar worker with an above average

214
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
income.

215
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,560
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly

216
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,840
and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

217
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,540
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector who might use

218
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,360
laptops both for studying and gaming.

219
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,520
There is no doubt that…

220
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,440
Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,800
You say that the computer is suitable for students but you don't think the price of

222
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,240
the X420 is just too much for most students?

223
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
Well that's a fair point.

224
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,200
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

225
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Is that okay?

226
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Yes, sure.

227
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,440
Okay, so as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

228
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,000
Firstly we'll have a nationwide television campaign as well as advertising on radio and

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,360
also in many computer publications.

230
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
We also intend to…

231
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is

232
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
cost effective?

233
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,400
I mean, how much does that go into cost?

234
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,760
Well I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with

235
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,640
you after the presentation.

236
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:26,120
Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.

237
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,640
All right, so this was part five of our presentation series.

238
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,280
We're halfway done with it and so far we've seen a lot of interesting things and as you

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,080
notice it's an intermediate lesson so it is a little bit more challenging and a little

240
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,520
bit longer than your previous lessons.

241
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,440
That's right, these are longer and some of the phrases that you've learned, these words

242
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
are very difficult.

243
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,400
But as a reminder, some of the words repeat.

244
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,240
So for example in today's dialogue we heard a lot about developing markets and campaigns,

245
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
but we also heard about these last week in episode four.

246
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,640
So if you're confused or you want some extra practice, I would recommend listening to some

247
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,640
of the older lessons again just to review because you're going to hear a lot of these

248
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,080
words and phrases over and over again.

249
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,720
That's right and of course if you have any questions about this or any suggestions you

250
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,100
can also come to our website EnglishPod.com where we'll see everyone there.

251
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:42,100
That's right, so until next week, bye everyone.
