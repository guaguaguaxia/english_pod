00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,160
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about eating food and certain foods that people

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
don't eat.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
That's right.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,680
So today we have special diets.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,240
We're going to talk all about being a vegetarian or a vegan and we're going to explain all

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,100
these words when we come back.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,000
So now let's just listen to the dialogue.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, Julie.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,440
Do you want to go grab something to eat?

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Sure.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
What do you feel like having?

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,800
I really feel like having a big juicy steak.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
Oh, okay.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,160
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,960
I'm sure wherever we're going, they will have other options, right?

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,840
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm not.

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm a vegan.

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
A what?

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
A vegan.

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
I don't eat or use any animal-based products.

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal.

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,280
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
and seafood.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Wow.

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
That's interesting.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,640
It must be tough.

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,240
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,960
more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,600
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,920
So now probably a lot of you have an idea of what it means to be a vegetarian, but let's

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,520
take a look at that word and many more on Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,080
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,280
So a vegetarian is a noun.

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,280
I am a vegetarian.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Yeah.

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Vegetarian is a noun.

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
It's a person.

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,860
You say I am a vegetarian.

42
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,160
He is a vegetarian.

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:54,120
And in this case, a vegetarian person does not eat meat.

44
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,000
So no chicken, no beef, none of that stuff.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,960
So as you can see, it has the prefix veget, like vegetable.

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
So that's what they eat.

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,320
They just eat vegetables.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:15,420
And it's a little bit hard to say what all vegetarians do or don't eat because some people

50
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,840
have different rules.

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
That's right.

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
Some people eat eggs, some people don't.

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,680
But there is something that is a little bit different from a vegetarian.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,080
It's called a vegan and this person has many, many rules about what he can or cannot eat.

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Right.

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,360
So a vegetarian basically does not eat meat.

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,800
A vegan, as we saw in our dialogue, doesn't wear leather, for example, doesn't wear leather

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,960
shoes or a jacket or use or eat anything that comes from an animal.

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
That's right.

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,480
No eggs, right?

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,000
No foods that might have any animal products in them.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,340
So vegans often try to find foods at the grocery store that come from natural products that

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,480
are not animal based.

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,080
And so there has to be a symbol on the back of the box or the jar that says that it's

65
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
vegan.

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
That's right.

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,320
So in that case, they don't drink milk, they don't eat eggs, nothing that you can think

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,560
of that comes from an animal.

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,040
But on the other hand, this person used to be a pescatarian.

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,480
So this is another type of person that has a special diet, very much like a vegetarian.

71
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,440
A pescatarian is a person who is a vegetarian but who also eats fish.

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,360
And so maybe I'm a pescatarian because I don't consider fish to be animals.

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Okay.

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,800
So I don't eat lamb, I don't eat chicken, but I do eat fish.

75
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I'm a pescatarian.

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
All right.

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:49,640
So a vegetarian does not eat fish or any type of meat, the same as a vegan, but a pescatarian

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,760
does eat maybe shrimp and fish and any type of animal from the sea.

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay.

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,840
And well, that brings us up to our next word.

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,520
A pescatarian will eat seafood.

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,200
Seafood is a word we use to describe animals that come from the sea.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,780
So not just fish.

84
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,640
So like you said, shrimp and lobster.

85
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,120
You could even think of really delicious food like a seafood pasta or a seafood salad, octopus,

86
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
things like that.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Okay.

88
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,240
So you got clams, you have oysters, anything that comes from the sea is considered seafood.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Right?

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
That's right.

91
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,920
And our last word in language takeaway is an adjective.

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,880
We heard at the end of the dialogue, our character said, it must be tough.

93
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Right.

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Okay.

95
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,200
That's an interesting word because in English it has a few different meanings, but what

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,680
was the meaning of the word tough in today's dialogue?

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,640
In today's dialogue, when the person said it must be tough, it's basically saying it

98
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,680
must be difficult.

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,760
It must be difficult to be a vegetarian.

100
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Right.

101
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,400
So it's a hard situation.

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,280
You could also say, oh man, this homework is really tough.

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
That means it's hard.

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
It's difficult.

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
All right.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Great.

107
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,600
So we've taken a look at a lot of key words there.

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Why don't we take a break?

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,560
Listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,640
Hey Julie, do you want to go grab something to eat?

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Sure.

112
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
What do you feel like having?

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,040
I really feel like having a big juicy steak.

114
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, okay.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,320
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.

116
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm sure wherever we're going, they will have other options.

117
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Right?

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,000
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm not.

120
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm a vegan.

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
A what?

122
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
A vegan.

123
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't eat or use any animal-based products.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk, or anything that comes from an animal.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,400
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
and seafood.

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Wow.

128
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
That's interesting.

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,760
It must be tough.

130
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,360
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:06,200
more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
All right.

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
Now we've prepared three phrases for you.

134
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,880
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Fluency Builder.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,820
So there's a very interesting and very, very common phrase at the beginning of today's

137
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,420
dialogue that we use all the time in English.

138
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,160
This is to grab something to eat.

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
The character says, hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,920
So taking that as a phrase, we are inviting someone to go eat something.

141
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
That's right.

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,480
So I could say, hey, do you want to go eat something?

143
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,320
Or I could say, hey, do you want to go grab something to eat?

144
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay.

145
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,880
And the verb grab is to take or to hold in your hand.

146
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,120
So you want to go grab something to eat is basically that.

147
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Right.

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,040
But don't be confused because grabbing normally means holding with your hand, but to grab

149
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,760
something to eat generally just means, hey, would you like to go eat something with me?

150
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Okay.

151
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,240
And of course we want to go grab something to eat and the guy says, I really feel like

152
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,040
having a big juicy steak.

153
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,160
So we feel like having a steak.

154
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,840
This is very spoken English.

155
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,320
So remember when you're talking to your friends, this is okay, but maybe if you're writing

156
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,260
something it's not as good.

157
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,680
But I feel like a steak means I want to eat a steak.

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Right.

159
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
So you're saying you are a steak.

160
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,400
No, I don't feel like a steak, like a piece of meat, but I do want to eat a piece of,

161
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,480
I do want to eat a steak.

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,320
And so I feel like having, or I feel like a steak.

163
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,080
These are both acceptable in spoken English.

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,040
So you basically feel like doing something or you feel like eating something.

165
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,560
For example, if we're going to have dinner, you can say, I feel like having Italian food.

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Yeah.

167
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
I don't feel like having Italian food tonight.

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,600
I feel like having Mexican food.

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
And I also feel like watching a movie.

170
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Exactly.

171
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:03,240
So great ways of using feel like, and then a verb like having or watching a movie.

172
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Now getting back to the vegetarian, the vegan aspect of our dialogue, we saw that the girl

173
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,200
explained how she doesn't eat or use any animal based products.

174
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,320
So these three words, animal based products.

175
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,440
So product is basically anything that will be sold or bought.

176
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,640
Animal based is a way to describe a product.

177
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,760
So some products have animal products in them.

178
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,400
So for example, my shoes are an animal based product because they are leather and leather

179
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,600
comes from cows, which are animals.

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,320
So you're basically saying that they have something from an animal.

181
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,600
They are made up of something that comes from an animal like leather shoes.

182
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Exactly.

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
And it's not just shoes.

184
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,840
It's also shampoo or some of the foods that you eat like in jars and cans.

185
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,720
It's important if you're a vegan to look on the side of the can or the side of the box

186
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,840
and see is this an animal based product?

187
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,600
Are there animal products in this?

188
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Right.

189
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Okay.

190
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
A lot of interesting things in this dialogue today.

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,600
Why don't we listen to it one last time and we'll be back.

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
Hey, Julie.

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,720
Do you want to go grab something to eat?

194
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Sure.

195
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
What do you feel like having?

196
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
I really feel like having a big juicy steak.

197
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh, okay.

198
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,520
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.

199
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm sure wherever we're going, they will have other options, right?

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,200
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.

201
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm not.

202
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm a vegan.

203
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
A what?

204
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
A vegan.

205
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,200
I don't eat or use any animal based products.

206
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal.

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,600
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish

208
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
and seafood.

209
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Wow.

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
That's interesting.

211
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,960
It must be tough.

212
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,560
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and

213
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,960
more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

214
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:15,920
All right, so talking about vegan vegetarians, pescatarians, it seems like these diets or

215
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
these lifestyles are more and more popular, but as we saw in the dialogue, it can be a

216
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,360
little bit difficult, especially maybe in countries where it's not so popular to have

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
these diets.

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Definitely.

219
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,400
I think that in places where you can find vegan and vegetarian products very easily,

220
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,560
being a vegetarian becomes much more easy because you have more options.

221
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,480
But if you're living in a country where it's very hard to eat a meal without having meat,

222
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,360
then you might just eat potatoes every day and that will get very, very difficult and

223
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
very boring.

224
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,840
Well, that's one of the main arguments or the main concerns with people is that even

225
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,000
though you can argue that you can get all the vitamins or many of the vitamins and minerals

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
from nuts and from vegetables, it's still not healthy to completely exclude from your

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,520
diet maybe sources of proteins like meat or eggs or dairy products.

228
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
That's right.

229
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,900
And so in America, for example, it's very easy to find supplements.

230
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,560
You can take vitamins like calcium and you can have pills that will give you some protein

231
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,160
and you can find all sorts of exotic vegetables that will help you supplement your diet.

232
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,240
But in a place like China, for example, I think it can be a lot harder to find those

233
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,520
products and to find those supplements.

234
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,200
And so being a vegan especially or a vegetarian poses a lot more challenges.

235
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,920
Especially I think with what you mentioned that products are usually labeled where they

236
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,360
tell you if they have any animal based products in there.

237
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Whereas in other countries, it's probably not labeled and it's a little bit, even things

238
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,080
like getting the fat free things are a little bit more difficult in other countries like

239
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
for example, China.

240
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
That's right.

241
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,400
So we would like to know, are there many vegans or vegetarians in your country?

242
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,600
And if there are, do you think it's hard for them to buy food?

243
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Why or why not?

244
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Let us know.

245

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
All right.

247
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
We'll see you guys there.

248
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:33,840
Take care.
