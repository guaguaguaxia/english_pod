00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,360
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,040
And today we're going to be looking at a very popular topic, something that everyone has

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,640
to do at least once in their life.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
That's right, we're talking about mobile phones and getting a mobile phone plan.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,500
Right, so you have a mobile phone, you need to get a plan or you need to do something

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,960
in order to make it work, right?

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,820
Yes, and in this lesson we're going to learn some language to help you do that.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,820
Alright, so let's start with the language on Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,620
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,460
In the dialogue, we're going to compare two types of mobile phone plans, the prepaid plan

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,180
and the monthly rate plan.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,140
Okay, so we have two types of plans, prepaid.

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,140
Prepaid plan.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,660
Okay, a prepaid plan.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,940
Well, a prepaid plan, basically, just like the name suggests, you pay before you use

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,940
the minutes.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,100
So maybe you have to buy a card and then you can use maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes or

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,380
100 minutes.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,380
Exactly.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,860
And then when you run out of money or you use all your minutes, you can buy another

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,500
card and like that.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,340
Yeah, but the monthly rate plan is different.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,500
So the monthly rate plan, you have to pay each month.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,900
Right, at the end of each month.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,120
At the end of each month.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,620
And what do you pay?

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,660
You pay for everything you used.

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,460
You get a bill at the end of the month.

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,460
Exactly.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,980
Okay, so very interesting.

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,100
These are the ways that mobile phone plans usually work.

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,260
And well, now it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the first time.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,980
We are going to be listening as a shopper is looking to buy maybe a mobile phone or

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:56,300
get a mobile phone plan.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,700
Yeah I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone and I'm not sure if I should

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,820
go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

39
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I see.

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,860
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,100
Unfortunately this phone can't be used in the US.

42
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,780
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,340
What really?

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,260
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260
Well you're in luck.

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,660
You see, if you sign up for our 3 year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Really?

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
What's the catch?

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
There's no catch.

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,180
You just choose a plan, sign a 3 year contract and that's it.

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,940
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now and we're giving away a Blackberry

52
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,180
Curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

53
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,860
So what does this plan include?

54
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,820
Well you get 900 anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to

55
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,140
other Telmobile clients.

56
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,020
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

57
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,060
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

58
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,060
Wow.

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,140
All this for $40 per month?

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,140
That's right.

61
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,940
Plus the activation fee and the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee and

62
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,780
any charges for extra minutes and...

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,300
Well it sounds like a lot more than $40, doesn't it?

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,700
This is very common.

65
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,020
They always say that it's a very low price and they always have these hidden charges,

66
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
right?

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
You're right.

68
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,260
So why don't we look at some of the language they were using in the dialogue now in Language

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,060
Takeaway.

70
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,460
All right, on Language Takeaway today we're going to be looking at 4 very basic words

72
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:38,180
that are used in this whole mobile phone context and the first one is activate.

73
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,220
To activate my cell phone.

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,580
All right, so you have to activate your cell phone.

75
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,580
That's right.

76
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,420
You have to make the cell phone work.

77
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,900
So basically you make it work.

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,620
Now can you only apply this to mobile phones?

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,900
No, there's many things that you must activate to make work.

80
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,420
For example, you must activate your computer software.

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,160
Okay, or maybe you have to activate your credit card.

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,940
Or activate your bank account.

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,860
So usually you do this for the first time before you start using it.

84
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,940
But imagine your mobile phone is sleeping, right?

85
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,140
And you need to activate it to make it start working.

86
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,460
But you only do it once.

87
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Right, only once.

88
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Okay.

89
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,180
We talk about mobile phone or we say the cell phone, but this also has a specific name,

90
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
right?

91
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
That's right.

92
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,180
A handset.

93
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
Handset.

94
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,180
A handset.

95
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,500
So the device, the phone, you can call it a handset.

96
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Exactly.

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,900
All right, a very easy word, but it's kind of a little bit more technical.

98
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Yeah.

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,060
Now, one of the things they were talking about with this monthly rate plan was a rollover

100
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,060
option.

101
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Rollover.

102
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,420
A rollover option.

103
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,460
So what is this rollover option about?

104
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,380
Well, okay, I'll give you an example.

105
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,500
Let's say you have 500 minutes each month.

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,460
And you only use four of them in this month.

107
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,100
100 of those minutes can roll over, can move over to the next month, so now you have 600

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
minutes.

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,620
So basically, the minutes that you don't use, you can still use the following month.

110
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
Right.

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,540
Okay, so that's a rollover plan.

112
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,540
Now, we might recognize the verb to roll over, right?

113
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,140
Right, so it's very similar to physically move from one place to another.

114
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Yep.

115
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
All right, rollover.

116
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,180
And now, in the end, we talked about many types of fees.

117
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,340
That's right, activation fee.

118
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,580
Okay, or we also had emergency services fee.

119
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,620
So what is a fee?

120
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,460
A fee is the amount of money you must pay for a service.

121
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,180
Okay, so this is important.

122
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
It's for a service.

123
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,060
Yeah, you can't pay a fee for something you can touch.

124
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,540
Okay, so if I go to the store, I don't say, what is the fee of this bottle of water?

125
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Right.

126
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,860
What's the fee for filling this bottle of water?

127
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,260
Okay, so for a service.

128
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,460
Yes, for an action.

129
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,980
All right, very good.

130
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,660
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

131
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,860
We're going to slow it down because it was a little bit fast, and then we'll come back

132
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,700
and look at some great phrases.

133
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Hi there.

134
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,020
Can I help you?

135
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,620
Yeah, I've just moved here, and I'd like to activate my cell phone.

136
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,820
And I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

137
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,140
I see.

138
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,060
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

139
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,740
Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

140
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,820
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

141
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
What?

142
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Really?

143
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,060
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,780
Well, you're in luck.

145
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,300
You see, if you sign up for our three-year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

146
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,700
Really?

147
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,220
What's the catch?

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,780
There's no catch.

149
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,780
You just choose a plan, sign a three-year contract, and that's it.

150
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,580
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now, and we're giving away a BlackBerry

151
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,860
Curve with our special mega-value $40 plan.

152
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,940
So what does this plan include?

153
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,900
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes, and you can also enjoy free mobile-to-mobile calling

154
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,100
to other Telmobile clients, 1,000 text messages per month, and unlimited evening and weekend

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
minutes.

156
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,380
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

157
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,460
Wow.

158
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,500
All this for $40 per month?

159
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
That's right.

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,820
Plus the activation fee, the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee, oh, and any

161
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,100
charges for extra minutes and...

162
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:55,500
Well, you know, there are some interesting phrases in this dialogue, and a lot of them

163
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,420
can be used when you're talking about a negotiation or a contract or a deal.

164
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
All right, great.

165
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,180
So let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

166
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
Fluency Builder.

167
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,980
Okay, the first phrase that we have on Fluency Builder today was the problem that she had

168
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,140
with her mobile phone was that it wasn't compatible with a 3G network.

169
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,700
Okay, to be compatible with.

170
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,580
To be compatible with.

171
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,900
To be compatible with.

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,740
Now this word compatible means that it works well with something else.

173
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Exactly.

174
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,180
Now there's a lot of things that you can use this phrase compatible with, together with.

175
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
You know, people, things.

176
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,660
So why don't we hear a few examples now.

177
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,380
Example one.

178
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,820
Our application is compatible with most smartphones.

179
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,140
Example two.

180
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,420
My roommate and I are just not compatible.

181
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,660
All she ever does is study, and I like to stay up late and party.

182
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Example three.

183
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm sorry, your computer is not compatible with our software.

184
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,100
It's too old.

185
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Okay, great example.

186
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,540
So compatible with, very clear, and it's very useful.

187
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
That's right.

188
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,260
Now, what about the next phrase?

189
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,980
Well, you know, the girl was hearing about all of these great things that are included

190
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,860
in the contract, and she asked, what's the catch?

191
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
What's the catch?

192
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
What's the catch?

193
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,660
So she was asking for the catch.

194
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
What is the catch?

195
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,780
Well, good thing you asked.

196
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:33,220
A catch is something negative, something that's hidden, that makes the deal seem not so great.

197
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,620
Okay, so if somebody offers me a new car.

198
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,940
They say, you can have this new for free.

199
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,260
Okay, well, that seems too good to be true.

200
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,900
So what is the catch?

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,660
The catch is that I can only drive it at night.

202
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,460
Okay, that's kind of annoying.

203
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Right.

204
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
So that's the catch.

205
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
There's like a condition.

206
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
Yep.

207
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,060
Now, she asked about the catch, and well, she said, well, there's no catch, you know,

208
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,760
you just signed the contract.

209
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,220
And then the salesman told the lady that she is in luck.

210
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,500
You're in luck.

211
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,660
To be in luck.

212
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,060
Well, okay, I think we can really understand the meaning, right?

213
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,260
When you're in luck, something lucky has happened.

214
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Right.

215
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
You're having good fortune.

216
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,980
But how do we use it?

217
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,220
So maybe you're looking for a very special bottle of wine for dinner tonight.

218
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,500
Yep, it's very rare.

219
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,620
Okay, and you go into this little store, and all of a sudden, you're in luck.

220
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,820
You found it there.

221
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Exactly.

222
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Okay.

223
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,620
This phrase is actually most commonly used in the second person.

224
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
You're in luck.

225
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,620
You are in luck.

226
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,900
You are in luck tonight.

227
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,620
Yeah, and usually when someone asks you for something, then you say, you're in luck.

228
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
You're in luck.

229
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
I have it.

230
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
Or you're in luck.

231
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
I have the very last one.

232
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Exactly.

233
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,260
All right, and now, to end a fluency builder, we have one more phrase.

234
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,700
And so it was when the salesman said, we'll throw in a handset for free.

235
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,380
All right, to throw something in.

236
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,420
So if she signs the contract, he will throw in a free handset.

237
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,340
It means to include something for free.

238
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,020
Okay, so you can say, if you buy this house, I'll throw in the dog for free.

239
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Right?

240
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,060
So to throw in, to include for free.

241
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Right.

242
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Okay.

243
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,780
All right, so great phrases, and I think we understand them now.

244
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,780
So let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time.

245
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah, I just moved here, and I'd like to activate my cell phone, and I'm not sure if I should

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,020
go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

247
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
I see.

248
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

249
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,300
Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

250
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,980
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

251
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
What?

252
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Really?

253
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,060
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

254
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Well, you're in luck.

255
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,860
You see, if you sign up for our three-year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

256
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Really?

257
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
What's the catch?

258
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
There's no catch.

259
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,460
You just choose a plan, sign a three-year contract, and that's it.

260
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,180
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now, and we're giving away a BlackBerry

261
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,380
Curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

262
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,820
So what does this plan include?

263
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,860
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes, and you can also enjoy free mobile-to-mobile calling

264
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,700
to other Telmobile clients, 1,000 text messages per month, and unlimited evening and weekend

265
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
minutes.

266
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,300
And we also offer a rollover option.

267
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Wow.

268
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,380
All this for $40 per month?

269
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
That's right.

270
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,180
Plus the activation fee and the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee, and

271
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,820
any charges for extra minutes and...

272
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Mobile phones.

273
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,900
This is very common in the United States, right?

274
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,180
These monthly plans.

275
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Yeah.

276
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,980
Most places where I have lived, it's much more common to pay as you go, right?

277
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,460
To have a prepaid plan.

278
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,420
But in the States, almost everyone goes with the monthly plan.

279
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,380
Maybe it's because in order to have a monthly plan, you need to have a credit card.

280
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,620
You might be onto something.

281
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
Right?

282
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,620
So if you don't have a credit card, or maybe you're 18, you can't get a monthly plan.

283
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,940
So you gotta do this prepaid plan.

284
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Yeah.

285
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Another interesting thing that I've noticed when living in different countries and seeing

286
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:22,180
mobile phone habits, Americans and North Americans respond very differently to a ringing mobile

287
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,860
phone than other people do.

288
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,660
How so?

289
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,940
For example, if I was in a meeting in America and my phone rang and I answered it, people

290
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,060
might think that I was very rude to answer the phone in a meeting.

291
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,460
But here, when we're living in China, it's totally normal.

292
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,580
Everyone does it.

293
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,620
That's the polite thing to do, answer your phone.

294
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Right.

295
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,980
And I think that's absolutely true, and maybe it's because in North America, you have this

296
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,220
voicemail option for your mobile phone.

297
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,620
Yeah, and everyone has it.

298
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Everyone has it.

299
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,180
So if it's something very important, then the person will leave you a voicemail message

300
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,580
and then you will know what it's about or you can call them back.

301
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,420
But here, I guess, or in other countries, maybe they don't have that option, so they

302
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,300
need to answer every call.

303
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Yeah, it's interesting.

304
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,340
An interesting sort of cultural difference in the way we use our phones.

305
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,740
But what about listeners?

306
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,980
In your country, do you answer the phone immediately or do you let it ring?

307
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,380
Right, or maybe do you see who's calling and maybe just not answer it.

308
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Yeah, screen your calls.

309
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
To screen a call.

310
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Yeah.

311
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,940
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com, let us know what your mobile phone habits are

312

Yeah, Marco and I are always there to answer your questions, so until next time, thanks

314
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500

315

Goodbye.
