00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Kathryn and today we're talking about things at the office.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,720
We are at the office but this time we are going to ask our boss or manager for a raise.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,040
Alright, so what is this word raise?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Let's take a look at it in today's vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,760
Alright, so we're going to ask for a raise.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,720
So if you are at your office and you talk to your boss and you say, I want a raise,

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
what does that mean?

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,240
That means I want more money.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,720
Okay, so I want a raise or increase in my salary.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
That's right.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,440
So a raise is a thing that you ask for and in this case a raise means that you already

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,160
work at the company, you already have a salary and you want some more money each month.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,800
Okay, so that's what we're going to be talking about today.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:02,040
Let's listen to this dialogue.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,160
Excuse me sir, may I talk to you?

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,760
Bill, sure, come on in.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
What can I do for you?

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,000
Well sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over 10 years.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I won't beat around the bush.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Sir, I would like a raise.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,320
I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
A raise?

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,520
Son, I would love to give you a raise but this is just not the right time.

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,840
I understand your position and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,040
impact on sales but you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,720
and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,240
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,320
willing to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,680
How does that sound?

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Great.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Bill, thank you sir.

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,000
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,400
Oh, the electric company, the gas company and the water company.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,680
Alright, we're back.

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,320
So now, why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Language Takeaway

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,280
So, the conversation we just heard is a conversation between a manager or a boss and the employee.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,000
And the employee says, listen, I need to talk to you about something.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,320
I have been an employee at this prestigious firm for over 10 years.

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,680
So prestigious is our first word.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,760
Okay.

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Prestigious is an adjective, right?

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
That's right.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
And it means very respected, very well known.

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,080
Esteemed, that's right.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,220
So something that is prestigious has a good reputation.

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,440
Like for example, some universities.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,640
You hear all the time about American universities like Harvard or Yale, which are considered

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,760
to be prestigious universities.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,200
Or the Nobel Peace Prize is a very prestigious award.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,560
So it's an adjective to describe something that's respectable, well known or esteemed,

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
as you said.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Exactly.

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Alright.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
And what's our next word?

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Our next one is not so happy.

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,040
This is what we've been experiencing in the global economy this last year or two.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,800
It's called an economic downturn.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Alright.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,880
So an economic downturn is something negative, as you said.

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,080
So it means that the economy is not doing very well.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Right.

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
So economy, economic, you know what this means.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,760
But in this case, downturn is the key part of this phrase to slow down or to decrease.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,240
So a downturn is a time when less people are making money and less money overall is being

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
earned.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay.

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
So an economic downturn.

75
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Very good.

76
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,720
So let me move on to our next word, which is negative impact.

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,480
So the thing working here is the economic downturn and it has had a negative impact

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,420
on our sales, on this company's sales.

79
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,640
So a negative impact, as you know from the first word, is not a good thing.

80
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Right.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
It's an effect, right?

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
That's right.

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
An effect, but that's negative.

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,440
So it's not a good effect.

85
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,360
So I could say that, Marco, being late has had a negative impact on your work lately.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Okay.

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,640
Or the opposite now.

88
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,360
What if something is a good effect on something?

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
So Marco, your hard work has had a really positive impact on this company lately.

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
All right.

91
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Good.

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
So you can use it negative impact or a positive impact.

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
All right.

94
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Right.

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,760
So impact again is just the effect that something has on something else.

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,080
And while the boss said that he agrees to give him a raise because in part he didn't

97
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,920
want to start a brain drain.

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
What's that?

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh, this is a very common phrase you hear about countries.

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,640
They have a brain drain or they want to avoid a brain drain.

101
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,240
A drain is the part of a sink or a bathtub where the water goes down.

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Okay.

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
It goes away.

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,920
And so brain drain means all the brains or intelligent people or educated people leave

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,080
a country and go to another country.

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,760
Or in this case, leave a company and go to another company.

107
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
All right.

108
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,760
So for example, if all the employees at Apple, maybe they start to quit or they start to

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,400
move jobs and start to work for maybe Microsoft or Google, that's a brain drain, right?

110
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
That's right.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,500
Because you're talking about a large number of people.

112
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,200
Maybe they're all unhappy because they say that working at Apple is not very nice.

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,640
So they all leave and go to this other company.

114
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,800
The same is true with countries.

115
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,640
You can have very, very well-educated people who when they stop studying, they want jobs,

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,840
they all look somewhere else.

117
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,880
They go to America or Mexico or England.

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,720
And so that's called a brain drain because they all go away.

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay.

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,760
So five great phrases right there and words for you.

121
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:57,880
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back to take a look at Fluency Builder.

122
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Excuse me, sir.

123
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
May I talk to you?

124
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Bill.

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Come on in.

126
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
What can I do for you?

127
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,720
Well, sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over 10 years.

128
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Yes.

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
I won't beat around the bush.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Sir, I would like a raise.

131
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,000
I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,240
A raise?

133
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,320
Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

134
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,680
I understand your position and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative

135
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,340
impact on sales.

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,760
But you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness and loyalty to

137
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,520
this company for over a decade.

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,280
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing

139
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,160
to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

140
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
How does that sound?

141
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Great.

142
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
It's a deal.

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Thank you, sir.

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,960
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

145
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh, uh, the electric company, the gas company and the water company.

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Okay.

147
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,920
Okay.

148
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,720
This first phrase in today's Fluency Builder is one of my favorites.

149
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,200
It's something that we say often when we're having a conversation and we want the other

150
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,640
person to just tell us what they're talking about.

151
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
All right.

152
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
So the guy said, you know what?

153
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

154
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,320
Or you could also say, please don't beat around the bush.

155
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,640
So I'm not sure where this phrase comes from, but it means please be direct or I'm going

156
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
to be direct.

157
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,480
I will not wait any longer to tell you what I'm talking about.

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,040
So if somebody is beating around the bush, that means they are not being direct.

159
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,200
They're not telling you something immediately.

160
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,480
It's you know, like when a person is trying to think, but you know, has a hard time and

161
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,680
they're really trying to explain something, but you know, it's just, well, you know what

162
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm talking about.

163
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,240
It's like that time with that thing where he did that.

164
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Okay.

165
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
This is really annoying.

166
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,960
I know it's called beating around the bush because you just don't say what you're thinking.

167
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Right.

168
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Exactly.

169
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
So you don't say something directly.

170
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,640
Now, our next phrase is to take into consideration.

171
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,480
Take something into consideration.

172
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,160
Well this is something that the young man brings up when he's asking for a raise.

173
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,620
He says, you should take into consideration all of these great things I do.

174
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,360
This means when you make your decision, I want you to think about these things.

175
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,320
So consideration means you're thinking when you're trying to make a decision.

176
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
To consider.

177
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
All right.

178
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,280
So to take something into consideration or you can just say to consider.

179
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,600
So I'm interested in buying a new TV, but I have to take into consideration the fact

180
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,080
that I don't have a lot of money.

181
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,280
That means I probably won't get a new TV.

182
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,160
I have to think about these things when I'm making my decision.

183
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Right.

184
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Okay.

185
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Very good.

186
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,600
And our last phrase for today, towards the end, the boss was a little bit interested

187
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,880
in knowing what happened or which companies were interested in him.

188
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,260
So he said, just out of curiosity.

189
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,960
So this is something we say when we don't need to know something.

190
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,920
It means that we would like to know because we're curious, we're interested, but not because

191
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,500
I need to know right away what companies offer you jobs.

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,820
So this is a polite way to ask why someone did something.

193
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,640
So for example, so just out of curiosity, Marco, what kind of shampoo do you use?

194
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,840
That is very interesting knowledge that you want there.

195
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Well, obviously I don't need to know what kind of shampoo Marco uses, but I'm curious

196
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,760
because maybe I'm going to buy a new kind of shampoo.

197
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,120
So you can start your sentence by using this phrase, just out of curiosity.

198
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,840
Just out of curiosity.

199
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
It's a great one.

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,680
Listen for that again as we listen to today's dialogue one more time, and we'll be back

201
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:49,040
in a moment to talk about getting a raise.

202
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Excuse me, sir.

203
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
May I talk to you?

204
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
Sure, come on in.

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
What can I do for you?

206
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,880
Well, sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over 10 years.

207
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes.

208
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,840
I won't beat around the bush, sir.

209
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,160
I would like a raise.

210
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,200
I currently have three companies after me, and so I decided to talk to you first.

211
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
A raise?

212
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,440
Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

213
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,800
I understand your position, and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,200
impact on sales, but you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness,

215
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

216
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing

217
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,320
to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

218
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,680
How does that sound?

219
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Great.

220
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
It's a deal.

221
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Thank you, sir.

222
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

223
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,600
Oh, the electric company, the gas company, and the water company.

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,400
All right.

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,520
We're back.

226
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,320
So interesting enough, he needed a raise not because three companies wanted to hire him,

227
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,920
but because he needed to pay his bills.

228
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,960
Well, this is funny because he's not talking about companies, that's right, who are offering

229
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
him jobs.

230
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,000
He's talking about the gas, the water, the electrical company.

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,120
It's a very funny dialogue, but I think asking for a raise is very hard to do because you

232
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,800
know that your boss is worried about money or it's a bad time to ask, but you want to

233
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,920
ask because it's important that you get the right compensation for your work.

234
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,080
And actually, it's important to have a clear objective when you want to ask for a raise.

235
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,440
So more or less what you want to earn, but plausible within the company.

236
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,980
So you're not going to ask for a 100% raise, right?

237
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,800
You can maybe aim for a 5 or 10% and most likely you'll get it if you negotiate properly.

238
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
That's right.

239
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,400
And sometimes a raise isn't just about money.

240
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
You can also, like he did, ask for some time off.

241
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,620
So he gets some vacation days or perhaps some training or bonuses or a bonus.

242
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,200
So this all depends on the kind of negotiations that you make, but it's worth it to ask.

243
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,320
So please let us know if you've ever had a good time or a bad time asking for a raise.

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
It can be a very nerve wracking experience.

245
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,680
I know personally I'm very uncomfortable with it, but we're excited to hear what you have

246
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
to say.

247
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,360
And if you have any questions or comments, leave them for us on our website, EnglishPod.com.

248
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
All right.

249
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
We'll see you guys there.

250
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Bye everyone.

251
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:43,240
Goodbye!
