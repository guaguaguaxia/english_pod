00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,640
My name is Catherine and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
That's right.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,040
We're going to go and buy shoes.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,720
Okay, this is very fun.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
I like buying shoes.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,360
Although I have a hard time finding shoes in my size sometimes but we're here talking

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,880
about men's shoes specifically.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
That's right.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,520
We've actually decided to talk about this topic, buying shoes separately between men

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,640
and women's shoes because I think each type of shoe has its own type of vocab and that

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,520
can be very useful for men or women.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
That's right.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,120
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk more

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,520
about the specifics of men's shoe styles.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:53,080
Hi, I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Sure thing.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Here we are.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,440
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of Oxford for boys.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,080
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,800
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,120
Mom, they've got Velcro.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, then how about these?

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,800
What is this style called?

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,020
They're tennis shoes.

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,760
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,240
Oh, mom, can I get these?

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,520
What are those?

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,040
They're Chuck Taylors.

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Everyone has them.

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Can I please?

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
I don't know.

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Would they go with your clothes?

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,880
a boot and the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,600
They're only $45 and they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Mom!

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Mom!

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,440
Okay, try them on.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
What size are your feet?

42
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,520
He's a size nine.

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,640
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,920
A what?

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,440
They come in European sizes.

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,560
He should be a size 43.

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
I'll be right back.

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,760
All right, we're back.

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,360
So as you saw, we have a lot of different shoe styles and so we're going to take a

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,400
look at these on Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,880
Language Takeaway.

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,700
Okay, first up we have a very popular style of shoe.

53
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,520
This is called an athletic shoe.

54
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,680
Okay, athletic shoe.

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Now I imagine that athletes wear these shoes.

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Good guess, Marco.

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,560
So athletic athletes.

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
This is actually for sports in general.

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,400
So this is sports shoes but in English we say athletic shoes.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,480
Okay, so it's not specifically for any type of sport but they're just comfortable shoes

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,320
that you can do most sports in.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,820
Right, like running shoes and basketball shoes and soccer shoes.

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,000
These are all kinds of athletic shoes.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Very good.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,400
So these types of athletic shoes, they're usually kind of low, right?

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
They don't have a lot of support around the ankle.

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,120
No, but they do have a lot of support in the heel, the bottom of your foot.

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,440
Right, because you're running, you need that extra support.

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Exactly.

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Now on the opposite, if you're going hiking, if you're maybe trekking, then you need a

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,600
special type of shoe that's going to give more ankle support and these are called hiking

73
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
boots.

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Okay, hiking boots.

75
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,000
So like you were saying, you get a lot of support in your ankle, that's the back of

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,040
your foot and the area around your leg.

77
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,880
So these shoes tend to come higher on your leg.

78
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,840
They're taller on your leg and they're usually pretty heavy.

79
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,480
And I think they are more weather resistant.

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,000
So if it rains or if it's wet, these shoes will respond better.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,040
You're not going to get wet feet.

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
So hiking boots.

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,400
And now we have another interesting word, I never really understood why they're called

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,280
this way, but we have sneakers.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Sneakers.

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
Okay, I love sneakers.

87
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
I always wear sneakers.

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,840
A very common brand that you see with sneakers is Puma, also Adidas.

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,120
So Converse is another brand.

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,040
Sneakers are shoes that are not fancy, they're not like leather or work shoes, but they're

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,840
also not athletic shoes because you don't necessarily use them when you're playing sports.

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,960
They're basically very simple shoes for normal daily stuff.

93
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Normal walking.

94
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,440
Young people wear them usually.

95
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,720
Okay, sneakers.

96
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,840
Now I never understood why they're called sneakers because I think if you sneak maybe

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,760
on someone, I guess these shoes are good for sneaking up on people.

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,920
Perhaps, I don't know.

99
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
They're less noisy than other shoes.

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Yeah, that's right.

101
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,040
Okay, so we have sneakers.

102
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,400
And now another type of shoe that can be a little bit confusing, they're called tennis

103
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
shoes.

104
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,840
Okay, tennis shoes can be considered a kind of sneaker.

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Again, it's not the kind of shoe that you would normally wear to work.

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,400
It's not leather, it's not a hiking boot.

107
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,720
They're low shoes, so low ankles generally.

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,120
And they tie up.

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,640
But you would think that you use these shoes to play tennis.

110
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Not necessarily.

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
But not necessarily, right?

112
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
I mean, you don't have to play tennis.

113
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,200
They're not specifically designed to play tennis.

114
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,520
Perhaps originally they were tennis shoes for the game tennis, but nowadays they're

115
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
very, very common.

116
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,960
They're like sneakers.

117
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,200
They're shoes that most young people wear to school or to play around in.

118
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay, so they're kind of like you say, a sneaker.

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,440
And now moving on, these might seem a little bit strange, but we call them Chuck Taylors.

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,760
Chuck Taylors, well basically Chuck Taylor is a brand.

121
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,640
Converse Chuck Taylors.

122
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,400
We also call them Chucks.

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,800
And this is a style of shoe that this brand made very famous.

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,920
They're very, very thin canvas shoes.

125
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,240
So the fabric is not leather, it's canvas.

126
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,080
And they come in bright red or black or green.

127
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,840
And some of them are very low.

128
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,160
And some of them have a piece of the ankle that comes up.

129
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,280
So it almost looks like a boot to a certain extent.

130
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,160
But it's not like a hiking boot.

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
It's not very hard.

132
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,520
It doesn't support your ankle as much.

133
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,280
It's just the style is higher.

134
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Exactly.

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,040
And so because these are made of fabric, they're very thin.

136
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
They're very light.

137
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,960
They're not very good for hiking, for example.

138
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Right.

139
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
So these are called Chuck Taylors.

140
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,920
They're very, very popular with teenagers, right?

141
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
That's right.

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Teenagers all over the world wear Chuck Taylors.

143
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,640
And I think they're very old.

144
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,800
This style, these Chuck Taylors have been around for like 30 years.

145
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
Yeah, I think since the 1960s or 70s.

146
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,120
But they're still popular.

147
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Yeah.

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
And they haven't changed.

149
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
They haven't changed.

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Right.

151
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,240
So these are the five types or styles of shoes that we're going to take a look at.

152
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,120
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab related to the parts of the shoe on

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,400
Language Takeaway Part 2.

154
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Language Takeaway.

155
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Okay.

156
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,920
So Jacob is talking to his mother and his mom wants to know, hey, how about these sneakers?

157
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,000
What do you think?

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,280
And Jacob says, Mom, they've got Velcro.

159
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Okay.

160
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,880
So Marco, what's this Velcro Jacob speaks of?

161
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,360
Well, as you can see, Velcro is capitalized, right?

162
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,840
And so that means this is a proper noun and it's actually a brand.

163
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Okay.

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
It's like Chuck Taylors.

165
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Like Chuck Taylors.

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,280
So Velcro is supposed kind of like a zipper, right?

167
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,360
A fastener.

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,960
But instead of zipping it up, you just put two pieces of cloth together and they stick.

169
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Okay.

170
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,560
And when you pull them apart, they make that sound.

171
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
They make a loud sound.

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,000
And so sometimes with baby shoes or young children's shoes, we don't want to tie them

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
because that's too hard.

174
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,440
So we have Velcro.

175
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,720
This is a kind of fabric, like you said, that sticks together.

176
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,680
We don't have to spend all this time tying things.

177
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,160
So you see Velcro on hats, on gloves, on jackets, on shoes.

178
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,160
It's a very popular way to make things, close things or to keep things secure.

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
In a very easy way, right?

180
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,160
You just push them together and that's it.

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
They're sealed.

182
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Exactly.

183
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
So the next time you see it, now you know that it's called Velcro.

184
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,520
I imagine in other languages, it's probably called the same thing.

185
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Well, right.

186
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
It's the brand name.

187
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Yeah.

188
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah.

189
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
So, okay.

190
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,480
And well, now moving on to the parts of the shoe, we have the tongue.

191
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Okay.

192
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,600
Well, think about the body part, the tongue, right?

193
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,640
When you look at your tongue, it's straight and it's flat and it kind of curves at the

194
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
bottom.

195
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Right.

196
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,640
So when you're putting your shoe on, you know, in the front of the shoe, you can make it

197
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
stuck.

198
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
You have to pull the tongue.

199
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Right.

200
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,360
It's a piece of fabric or piece of the shoe where the top of your foot is.

201
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Yeah.

202
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Very good.

203
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
So that's called the tongue.

204
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,000
Now, some shoes have a very small tongue or a low one and others have a very high one.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,560
Like for example, Chuck Taylors, they have a big tongue.

206
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
That's right.

207
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Very long tongue.

208
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,760
And so the tongue is the part that rests on top of your foot.

209
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
And usually the shoelaces are over the tongue.

210
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Exactly.

211
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,080
And now moving on to the bottom part of the shoe, that's called the sole.

212
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay.

213
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
S-O-L-E.

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Sole.

215
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
This is a really important part of shoes.

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,040
I always look at the sole before I buy a pair of shoes because this is the part that you

217
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,280
use the most because you're walking on the ground.

218
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Right.

219
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:22,040
So for example, hiking boots, they will have a very high sole and they will have kind of

220
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,960
like a pattern so that you don't slip if you're walking on dirt, right?

221
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
That's right.

222
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,320
Sometimes rubber, a rubber sole.

223
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,040
But other times, like Chuck Taylors also have a rubber sole but it's very thin.

224
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,200
It's very thin.

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,760
And some shoes, for example, they have a plastic sole maybe because they're used for other

226
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,880
purposes so they might be a little bit slippery if you go onto a smooth surface.

227
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Exactly.

228
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,080
So the sole, that's the bottom part of the shoe.

229
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,880
And the last part of the shoe that we're going to take a look at and probably the most

230
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,840
important are the shoelaces.

231
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
Shoelaces.

232
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,400
So shoelaces are basically long pieces of string that you use to tie your shoes closed

233
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,360
because you want your shoes to be tight on your foot.

234
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
You don't want it to be too loose otherwise it might fall off.

235
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,280
And Chuck Taylors and some other shoes are very famous for having crazy colored laces

236
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,320
or for people using crazy colored laces to tie them up.

237
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Right.

238
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,400
So that's the part they use to tie or tighten the shoe with.

239
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,120
So on the opposite, if a shoe doesn't have shoelaces, it's probably going to have Velcro.

240
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
That's right.

241
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Velcro or shoelaces.

242
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Okay.

243
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,160
So those are all the words that we have for you today.

244
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time.

245
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,240
Hi.

246
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

247
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Sure thing.

248
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Here we are.

249
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,800
If you're looking for dress shoes, we have several different styles of Oxford for boys.

250
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
We also carry athletic shoes, hiking boots.

251
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,120
Oh, Jacob, how about these sneakers?

252
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,520
Mom, they've got Velcro.

253
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Well, then how about these?

254
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
What is this style called?

255
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,400
They're tennis shoes.

256
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,080
They're very popular with teens and young adults.

257
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,600
Oh, mom, can I get these?

258
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
What are those?

259
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,400
They're Chuck Taylors.

260
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Everyone has them.

261
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Can I please?

262
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I don't know.

263
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,000
Would they go with your clothes?

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,520
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up, they're almost like

265
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
a boot.

266
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,200
And the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

267
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
They're only $45.

268
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,960
And they've got cool, fluorescent orange shoelaces.

269
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Mom!

270
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Mom!

271
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,720
Okay, try them on.

272
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
What size are your feet?

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
He's a size nine.

274
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,920
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

275
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
A what?

276
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
They come in European sizes.

277
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,880
He should be a size 43.

278
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,960
I'll be right back.

279
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,680
All right, so talking about shoes, you say that you always take a look at the sole.

280
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,000
Why is this?

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,880
Because I'm always afraid that my shoes are going to wear out.

282
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,440
And I don't buy shoes very often.

283
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
I love sneakers.

284
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,520
I love my Pumas.

285
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,980
And I love flat shoes.

286
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,120
And so when you buy a pair of shoes you really like, you don't want to buy another pair in

287
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
six months.

288
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
You want to get a pair that has a really good sole so that it will last for a long time.

289
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Right, right.

290
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Yeah, that's true.

291
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,600
I think for me, yeah, that's probably one of the most important parts is the sole, as

292
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
long as it's comfortable.

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Because some soles of some shoes can be very rigid.

294
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah.

295
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
So it's a little bit uncomfortable to walk with.

296
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
But I don't know.

297
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,320
I don't really have that many pairs of shoes if I think about it.

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,680
Well, most people have one fancy pair of shoes for special occasions.

299
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,560
And then a pair of work shoes that are leather.

300
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,040
And then maybe a couple pairs of sneakers and some sandals for the summer.

301
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,760
So you have sandals and you have flip flops.

302
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,000
Are they the same?

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, sandals is basically a kind of shoe.

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's an open shoe that you wear in the summer.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,180
Flip flops are a kind of sandal.

306
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,480
So they usually have a V in the front.

307
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
And that's where you put your big toe.

308
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
The second toe.

309
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,640
So we wear them in the shower or at the beach.

310
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,880
They're usually made of plastic or rubber so that you can get them wet.

311
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,760
But flip flops are a kind of sandal.

312
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
Very good.

313
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
It's very interesting how many styles and types of shoes.

314
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,440
And actually for men, I think it's not that complicated.

315
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,960
But when we get into women's shoes, then we'll see a lot of different things.

316
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
There are too many styles.

317
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
I can't keep track.

318
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
All right.

319
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
So that's all the time we have for today.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,880
But we'll see you guys on the website if you have any questions, any doubts, or if you

321
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,320
just want to chat with us.

322
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
We'll see you at EnglishPod.com.

323
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
See you guys there.

324
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
All right.

325
00:13:45,280 --> 00:14:12,860
Try it out.
