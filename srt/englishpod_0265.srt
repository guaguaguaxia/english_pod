00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,280
My name is Kathryn and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
That's right.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,360
Today we are dealing with a house that is filled with different types of bugs.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
Ew, bugs.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,960
Well, it's summertime so it's not that uncommon but not a pleasant thing to deal with.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
That's right.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
So we're going to call an exterminator.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,480
So you might be asking yourself what that is but before we explain, why don't you listen

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,400
to the dialogue for the first time.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,240
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,280
These bugs are driving us crazy.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,880
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,680
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,200
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place and last night I saw a

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,320
huge rat out in the backyard.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,200
Well there's nothing that we can handle.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,120
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches but the termites will

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
be harder to get rid of.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,560
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,580
Unfortunately, that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,640
No problem.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:29,720
Let's get rid of the bugs.

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Alright we're back.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,920
So now we have six key words that we've chosen out for you.

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Let's take a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,840
Well Marco you've already told our users the very first word that would be exterminator.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
What is an exterminator?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,180
It's a person, right?

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:54,160
That's right, it's a person that has the job to exterminate or to delete or eliminate different

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,600
types of bugs or pests.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,240
So an exterminator's job is to kill bugs.

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
That's right.

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,360
And usually an exterminator comes to your home or your office to do this, right?

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
That's right.

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,560
So maybe in your house you have a lot of different types of bugs.

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,660
Maybe you have, I don't know, spiders.

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,920
So an exterminator will come and he will try to get rid of the spiders.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Great.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,040
So an exterminator in a general sense gets rid of pests.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,720
And pest is our next word.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,080
That's right, a pest.

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,440
Now we're talking about bugs and they can be considered a sort of pest.

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Well pest though is a more general term, right?

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,520
So you can say pest about something like rats or mice.

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
That's right.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,080
So basically some type of animal that is very annoying and also causes some sort of harm

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
or danger.

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Right.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,560
So there was a movie if I remember correctly in the 1990s.

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
It was terrible and it was called The Pest.

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Yeah, that's right.

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,640
And it's all about this person who is very annoying.

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,480
So you can even say an annoying person or a bothersome person is a pest.

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
That's right.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
You're such a pest.

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,120
Okay, so obviously our home is filled with bugs and that's what the person said that

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
it is infested.

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,680
Okay, so a place like an office building or like you said Marco, a home is infested if

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,700
it is filled with something.

64
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,080
And so infested means it's filled with something bad.

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
That's right.

66
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
So in this case the house is infested with bugs.

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,280
They're living upstairs, downstairs, in the basement, in the kitchen, they're everywhere.

68
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
That's right.

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,520
And she said that we, well actually they have termites in the wood.

70
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,760
All right, so termites are a special kind of bug that almost always live in wood, right?

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
That's right.

72
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
They're little bugs that I think eat the wood.

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,720
And this is why they're so dangerous because they make the house weak because they eat

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,760
off all the wood that supports it.

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,680
So we can say the house fell down because it was infested with termites.

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
That's right, termites.

77
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,200
And also we have a very common pest or a bug.

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
We have cockroaches.

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,880
Oh, I hate these and they're everywhere this summer.

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
Cockroaches come in different sizes.

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,560
Some are big, some are small, but they're very, very strong bugs.

82
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
They can live through anything.

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
That's right.

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,920
They're small, usually brown, but sometimes I think you can see black cockroaches.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
That's right.

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,800
And they love to be near food and decaying things like garbage bins.

87
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
That's right.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,880
So a very common type of pest, cockroach.

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,960
And in order to get rid of termites and cockroaches and all these types of bugs, we have to fumigate

90
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
the house.

91
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,400
Okay, so this is one method that the exterminator uses to kill bugs.

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,240
And like in the dialogue, when you fumigate a house, basically you fill the house with

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,920
fumes or gases that kill bugs.

94
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,360
So people like you and me, we can't be in the house when that happens, right?

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
That's right.

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,440
Actually, if you see an exterminator, he will always fumigate wearing a mask so he doesn't

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
inhale those poisonous gas.

98
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Right.

99
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,640
So it's very dangerous for people and you'll have to make sure you talk to your exterminator

100
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,320
to make sure that the gases he's using aren't getting into your body.

101
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
That's right.

102
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:24,040
Okay, so why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,720
Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,240
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,320
These bugs are driving us crazy.

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,880
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,680
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything.

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,200
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a

109
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,280
huge rat out in the backyard.

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,200
Well there's nothing that we can handle.

111
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,100
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will

112
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,600
be harder to get rid of.

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,560
Unfortunately, that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
No problem.

116
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:09,920
Let's get rid of the bugs.

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,160
All right, so now we've chosen three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Fluency Builder.

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Well, this first phrase comes from the very beginning of today's dialogue.

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,840
The second person in the dialogue says, these bugs are driving us crazy.

121
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
So, to drive someone crazy.

122
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Okay, so if you're driving someone crazy, it means that you're making them crazy.

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,760
All right, so it could be you're making them angry or you're making them frustrated, but

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,160
it has nothing to do with cars, right?

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah, yeah, there's no driving involved.

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
So driving here means making.

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,820
You're making me crazy.

128
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,100
You're really making me frustrated.

129
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
That's right.

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,160
So in this case, the animals, the bugs were driving them crazy.

131
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,000
They were so annoying that they were just, they were very irritated.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,880
So I could do something, Marco, that will drive you crazy.

133
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,760
I could tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
That's right.

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
That's driving me crazy.

136
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Doesn't it annoy you?

137
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Yes.

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
So I'll stop.

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,720
So it doesn't drive you crazy anymore.

140
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
That's right.

141
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,520
Okay, so now obviously bugs are driving them crazy and she went on to explain that it's

142
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,400
because the house is infested with just about everything.

143
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,280
Well, this is a great phrase because we can say it in a lot of different contexts.

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,280
In this context, it means there is not everything, every single bug in the house, but just about

145
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
everything.

146
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,720
That means almost every bug you can think of is in this house.

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
That's right.

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,400
So it's kind of a way of exaggerating also because obviously, well, they have cockroaches,

149
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,720
they have termites, but they're saying we have a lot of different types of bugs.

150
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,560
We have just about everything that you can imagine.

151
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,000
You could even say, this restaurant has just about every Chinese dish you could ever think

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
of.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's not true.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,760
It doesn't have every single one, but it has a lot.

155
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
That's right.

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Okay, so that's the way that you use just about everything.

157
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,040
And for our final phrase, we use it a little bit earlier on.

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Let's explain it a little bit.

159
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,640
When we're talking about bugs, we want to get rid of bugs.

160
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,920
This is why we call the exterminator, to get rid of the cockroaches.

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,960
You might hear this phrase a lot when you're watching movies about gangsters or mobsters

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,440
like The Sopranos, the TV show, get rid of him.

163
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,840
So this is a phrase that means, in this case, to kill something or to kill someone, to get

164
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,760
rid of it, to get rid of him.

165
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,200
To not have it anymore.

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,960
So rid means to get away or to throw away.

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,880
But in this case, you're not just throwing it away, you're killing these bugs.

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
That's right.

169
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,600
So we want to get rid of the bugs.

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,280
Now obviously, as you said, we can also throw away, for example, these shoes are too old.

171
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm going to get rid of them.

172
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,360
Or, hey Marco, this milk smells funny.

173
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Can you get rid of it?

174
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,520
Very good.

175
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,320
So that's the way that you would use that phrase, to get rid of something.

176
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,040
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time and we're back to talk

177
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
a little bit more.

178
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:23,880
Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

179
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,520
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

180
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,640
These bugs are driving us crazy.

181
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,160
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

182
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,960
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything.

183
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,600
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,560
And last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard.

185
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
Well there's nothing that we can't handle.

186
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,360
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will

187
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,880
be harder to get rid of.

188
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,840
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

189
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Unfortunately, that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

190
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,880
No problem.

191
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:06,000
Just get rid of the bugs.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
So bugs.

193
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
Everyone loves bugs, right?

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't know.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,200
I am actually okay with termites or for example cockroaches.

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,840
They're a little bit weird, but I actually really dislike spiders.

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Really?

198
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Yeah.

199
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,360
So you're okay with cockroaches, but spiders make you nervous.

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Yeah.

201
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Yeah.

202
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Spiders are...

203
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,560
Well, the thing is, spiders can actually hurt you.

204
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
That's right.

205
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
And cockroaches generally cannot.

206
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
They're gross.

207
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
They're dirty.

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,760
But spiders, there are very, very many kinds of dangerous spiders out there that are poisonous.

209
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
That's right.

210
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,480
So for example, termites, nothing's going to happen.

211
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
Or cockroaches, they're nasty.

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,340
Not unless your house is weakened by hundreds of millions of termites.

213
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
That's right.

214
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:53,160
But for example, I think other people have snakes sometimes as pests because they live

215
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,840
in areas that have a lot of snakes or mice because snakes are attracted by mice.

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
That's right.

217
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,520
So some people keep cats for that reason.

218
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,720
They want the cats, especially on farms, the cats to catch the mice or to scare the snakes

219
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
away.

220
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,080
But I don't really have a problem with snakes or spiders, but I do have a problem with scorpions.

221
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, scorpions.

222
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,400
If you live close to a desert or a very dry area, scorpions, they really scare me.

223
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,720
I've seen on, I think, Discovery Channel that in Australia, they're very common.

224
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,520
And so not only scorpions, but also spiders.

225
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,040
So whenever you put your shoes on, you have to check that there's nothing in it.

226
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
That's right.

227
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Also, shower drains.

228
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,480
You know where the water goes down the hole in the shower?

229
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Oftentimes you get things like scorpions in the desert areas that come out of the drain.

230
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Really?

231
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Oh, wow.

232
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,680
That looks like something from a horror movie or something.

233
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Yeah.

234
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,920
All of a sudden, you're in the shower and there's pests coming out of the drain.

235
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
That's nasty.

236
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Terrifying.

237
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
All right.

238
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,600
So a lot of different types of kind of scary bugs and pests.

239
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
But we would like to know if you've ever had an infestation in your home or what pests

240
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
are you afraid of?

241
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,160
So let us know, our website is EnglishPod.com.

242
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
We hope to see you there.

243
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
All right.

244
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
We'll see you guys next time.

245
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Bye.

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:31,980
Bye bye.
