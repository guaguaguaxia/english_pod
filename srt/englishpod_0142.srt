1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,520
Welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,040
My name is Catherine and that's us.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,040
And that's us.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,080
And today we're going to talk about a very common situation when you're a couple, when

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,080
you have a girlfriend.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
Honey, come on.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,080
I want to go.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
Are you?

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
You are taking forever.

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,360
All right.

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Who takes long?

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,800
Like do you take a long time to get ready, to get dressed?

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Okay.

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,160
I take longer to get ready, but my boyfriend takes longer in general because he's like

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,400
checking his email, playing video games, like just, you know, we call it lollygagging.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,840
He's just like being kind of slow.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm the opposite.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
I usually start getting ready later.

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,120
Like if we have to leave at nine, I'll start getting ready at 830, but I'll be ready by

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,160
nine because I take a shower real fast, get dressed, and I know what I'm going to wear

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
and all my clothes are ready.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,320
On the other hand, my girlfriend takes forever to get ready and she's like, oh, and then,

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
you know, the hair.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,320
Girls have makeup and tights and shoes.

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,640
But this is what I understand.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,000
If we're supposed to leave at nine, why don't you start getting ready before?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Never underestimate women.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Procrastination.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
Hey, it's not even about procrastination.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,120
Sometimes it just takes longer to look good than other times.

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Right.

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Well, in this case, we're going to be looking at a lesson where it's the opposite.

36
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,960
The husband is taking a long time to get ready and well, I don't think he has a very good

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,720
fashion sense, right?

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
He does not.

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
And we're going to learn what that phrase means in a minute here.

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,600
But before we get going, I've got a couple of words to preview to help you understand

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,480
what's going on in today's dialogue.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Vocabulary preview.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
All right.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,360
So, vocabulary preview.

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
Today we have two words.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,800
The first one can be a noun or a verb, to iron.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Or iron.

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,320
So to iron basically means to...

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,560
To get the wrinkles out of clothes.

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
And so we use this...

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,860
Iron is actually a metal.

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,320
It's a very important metal.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,360
And an iron is a machine that we plug in.

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,600
We use it to get the wrinkles, the lines out of our shirts and our skirts and everything.

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,120
So, it's actually a very important thing to make sure that you look nice and put together.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Right.

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,120
So, you use an iron to iron your shirt or to iron your skirt.

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,040
And then we have sandals.

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
My favorite type of shoe.

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Mine too.

61
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Sandals.

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
I have a friend who used to say she had claustrophobic feet.

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,440
Her feet didn't like to be in closed spaces.

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
So, she only wore sandals.

65
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,480
So these are open shoes, open toe shoes basically.

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
You wear them at the beach.

67
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,440
Or you wear them in the summer in general.

68
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,080
I'm wearing sandals right now.

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,800
And you have different types of sandals like sandals and flip-flops, right?

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Flip-flops I think they're called that because they sound like flip-flop, flip-flop when

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you walk.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,240
Alright, so those are our two words today.

73
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll be back.

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Honey, come on.

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,640
We're going to be late.

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,440
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,260
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,480
Can you come here for a second?

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
I need your help.

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
What is it?

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,600
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

82
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,080
I don't know what to wear.

83
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,240
Okay, give me your opinion.

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
Do you like the way this looks?

85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,320
The striped short-sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

86
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,720
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts.

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,440
So I think I'll wear these as well.

88
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Are you joking?

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
What am I going to do with you?

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,600
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

91
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,120
Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,480
It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Thanks, honey.

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,520
You have such great fashion sense.

95
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,240
Now what am I going to do with my hair?

96
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,480
All right, we're back.

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,200
So interesting, this husband sounded a lot like a famous president, I think.

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,520
He did, but we'll get to that in a minute.

99
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,720
Before we do talk about who this guy is, I think it'd be a great idea to talk about some

100
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,060
of these clothing terms because they're very useful for when you want to go shopping and

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,640
for when you're getting dressed.

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Language takeaway.

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,520
Okay, so the first word that we have on language takeaway is striped.

104
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,880
All right, you might have heard of the American flag called stars and stripes.

105
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,040
Stripes are those lines on clothing or on flags that go up or down or left and right.

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Exactly.

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,760
So if you have a striped shirt, you have many lines on your shirt that are going up and

108
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
down or left and right.

109
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,160
Right, and they say with fashion, lines that go left to right make you look fatter and

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
lines that go up and down make you look thinner.

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
And taller.

112
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
And taller.

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Very good.

114
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,160
And now moving on, if it's summer and you want to wear a shirt, you can wear a short

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
sleeved shirt.

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
All right, this is important.

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,300
So most people like to wear short sleeved shirts in the summertime because they're cooler.

118
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,640
And in the wintertime, that means we like to wear long sleeved shirts.

119
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, so the sleeves are basically the arms of the shirt.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Exactly.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You say short sleeved.

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Very good.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,920
And then we have a checkered shirt or a checkered sweater in this case.

124
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Okay, so checkered means there are little squares on the shirt and usually one square

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
is one color and the next square is another color.

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,440
So it looks like a checkerboard.

127
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Very good.

128
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
That game, you know, checkers.

129
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
Or like a chessboard.

130
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Exactly.

131
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,920
And so in this case, we've got a guy who's trying to wear a striped shirt and a checkered

132
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,200
sweater.

133
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,160
That does not go well together, right?

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
No.

135
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,920
Too much stuff happening.

136
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
It's too busy.

137
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Too busy.

138
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
All right.

139
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,880
And not only that, but he wanted to wear shorts because he liked the cut and the hemline.

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,440
Okay, these are actually terms that we normally use with women's clothing because you could

141
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
say, I like the cut of this dress.

142
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,560
I like the shape that it has.

143
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Very good.

144
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,560
So the hemline is the bottom of your skirt or your trousers or your shorts and hemline,

145
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
we could say, my mother used to say this to me, the hemline is much too high, much too

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
short.

147
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
That skirt is not appropriate.

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Yeah.

149
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,320
So it's nice to have a hemline at the knee.

150
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
All right.

151
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,240
So the cut is the shape that the piece of clothing has like pants or skirts and the

152
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,400
hemline would be the place where it ends, right?

153
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
The skirt, for example.

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,040
Like it pretty much tells you the length of something.

155
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,560
Very good.

156
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,120
And now the wife steps in, she's like, no, no, you're not wearing this.

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,000
She's telling him that she has to wear nice clothes and among those items is a silk tie.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
So a classic Father's Day gift.

160
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Silk tie.

161
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
I've given this one a couple of times.

162
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,200
A silk tie is a necktie, a long necktie that's made of silk.

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,240
Silk is a very soft material, right?

164
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,360
Very expensive as well.

165
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,080
It can be, especially Italian silk.

166
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,800
And I've always actually wanted to have silk sheets.

167
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
Ooh, see, I don't know.

168
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,560
I feel like they would get very warm in the summer.

169
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Yeah.

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,240
Well, in the winter it would be awesome, but probably very cold in the winter as well.

171
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Yeah.

172
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
I don't know.

173
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, it's one of those things.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,360
And then she's also telling him to wear some corduroy pants.

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Okay.

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,360
So it sounds like this might be a winter dialogue because corduroy is not something you wear

177
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,680
in the summer because it's very heavy and thick.

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,760
Corduroy actually is a fabric that usually has these kind of ribs or ridges.

179
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,680
And so there's like little lines in the fabric that make it quite thick and rough when you...

180
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Almost not rough, but they make it feel very unique when you touch it.

181
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Yeah.

182
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
It's not smooth.

183
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
It's a little bit rough, the fabric.

184
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Very good.

185
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,600
So those are all the clothing items that we've looked at today.

186
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,640
There's a lot of them.

187
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,760
And obviously we'll post a couple of pictures on the site so you can see better what a silk

188
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,280
tie looks like or especially corduroy pants.

189
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Corduroy, yeah.

190
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
All right.

191
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,000
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,320
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some of the

193
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
phrases.

194
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Honey, come on.

195
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
We're going to be late.

196
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

197
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

198
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Can you come here for a minute?

199
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm not ready.

200
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
I'm not ready.

201
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
I'm not ready.

202
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm not ready.

203
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
I'm not ready.

204
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
I'm not ready.

205
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm not ready.

206
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm not ready.

207
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm not ready.

208
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm not ready.

209
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I'm not ready.

210
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm here for a sec.

211
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I need your help.

212
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
What is it?

213
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Why are all these clothes on the bed I don't know what to wear.

214
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
Okay, give me your opinion.

215
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Do you like the way this looks the strap short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater?

216
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,800
My lucky sandals I like the cut in hemline of these shorts.

217
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,580
So I think I'll wear these as well.

218
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Are you joking?

219
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,080
What am I going to do with you

220
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,260
Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

221
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,660
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

222
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,840
Thanks, honey.

223
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
You have such great fashion sense.

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,640
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

225
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:09,160
Alright, we're back, so now let's start with Fluency Builder.

226
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Fluency Builder.

227
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,440
OK, these are classic couple phrases, right?

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
These are phrases you hear among couples, and the first one is maybe more common to

229
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,760
hear from the female end, but it's not unknown on the male end.

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,640
So, we have this question.

231
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you like the way this looks?

232
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,800
So while the person is saying this, they would maybe be moving to the side a little bit.

233
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,360
Modeling it.

234
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Do you like the way this looks?

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,600
So basically you're saying, do you like what I'm wearing?

236
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Does it look good on me?

237
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Does it look good?

238
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Exactly.

239
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,200
You could also say, hey, I like the way this looks when you're trying to buy something

240
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
at the store.

241
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,720
And so, do you like the way this looks is a way for you to ask the other person's opinion

242
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,040
of how you look.

243
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,360
And also, another common phrase, especially with men who have no fashion sense, the wife

244
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,000
says, what am I going to do with you?

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,600
OK, this is an interesting phrase and it needs some explanation, I think, because the meaning

246
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,920
is, well, this is very difficult, right?

247
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,600
So you're being difficult or, wow, you need some help from me.

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm going to help you.

249
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,280
How am I going to help you this much or all the time like this?

250
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,680
Right, because she's pretty much saying he has no idea about clothing and fashion.

251
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,880
So he's saying to her, what am I going to do with you?

252
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,480
It means you need so much help.

253
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Seriously.

254
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,680
All right.

255
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,560
And the third phrase that we saw and we said at the very beginning is fashion sense.

256
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,240
OK, so this is actually what the man needs help with.

257
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,360
He needs help with his fashion sense because he has zero fashion sense.

258
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,040
And this is pretty much a way to say how much someone knows about fashion or appearances.

259
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,840
And so I can say, oh, my friend Kathy, she has amazing fashion sense.

260
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,040
So she always looks good.

261
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Right.

262
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,080
So combining colors appropriately or wearing the right types of shoes with the right types

263
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
of clothing, et cetera, fashion sense.

264
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,100
Or even just being able to wear things that are good on her or telling other people what's

265
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,640
good on them.

266
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,920
So fashion sense is the ability to identify fashion and look good and make other people

267
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
look good.

268
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
All right.

269
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Very good.

270
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,800
Let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time and we'll come back and talk a little

271
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,880
bit more about fashion because it's a very interesting topic.

272
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
It is.

273
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
Honey, come on.

274
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
We're going to be late.

275
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,200
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

276
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,240
Can you come here for a sec?

278
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
I need your help.

279
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
What is it?

280
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

281
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
I don't know what to wear.

282
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,520
OK, give me your opinion.

283
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Do you like the way this looks?

284
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,080
The striped short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater, my lucky sandals.

285
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,480
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts.

286
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
So I think I'll wear these as well.

287
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Are you joking?

288
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
What am I going to do with you?

289
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
We're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

290
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,880
Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants.

291
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,240
It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.

292
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,440
Thanks, honey.

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,160
You have such great fashion sense.

294
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,960
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

295
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,080
All right, we're back.

296
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
You lived in Italy for a while.

297
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,040
How is the fashion over there?

298
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
Is it extreme like we see on the runways?

299
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,760
Because I honestly don't understand fashion.

300
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,040
Well, the thing about runways is that that's not how normal people dress.

301
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,560
Well, yeah, that's what I understand.

302
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,720
Why do they have these fashion shows if people don't really buy these types of clothing?

303
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,160
Well, sometimes people like stores, for example, big stores, department stores will buy fashions

304
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,560
off of the runway and they'll kind of change them a little bit so that they're more appropriate

305
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,840
for normal consumption.

306
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,940
That means for normal people who want to wear them.

307
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,400
But the runway fashions are actually, they're kind of like exaggerations of trends that

308
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,640
will happen in the shopping world, right, in the commercial world.

309
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,320
So the things that you see are like big, blown up exaggerations.

310
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,840
And we take bits and pieces of those in our daily lives to dress up.

311
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,960
So different colors or fabrics or like oftentimes you see kind of military outfits.

312
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,840
And so that will translate into military jackets that are very popular one season.

313
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,980
And so Italy definitely counts as a very fashionable country, but it's not crazy.

314
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,960
Well, every once in a while you see some more crazy clothes, but I think Japan is much more

315
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
crazy as far as style.

316
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah, actually, yeah.

317
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,480
Asian countries such as Japan or South Korea, they have very, also unique fashion as well,

318
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,560
but it's very extreme to a certain point.

319
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,760
And the color combinations they do is like red sneakers with green pants and like a blue

320
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
jacket.

321
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
It's very crazy.

322
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Right.

323
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
And very bright.

324
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,080
And you often see these shoes, you know, we call them platform shoes.

325
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,800
It's kind of like you're standing on a brick.

326
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,560
Yeah, they're huge.

327
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,360
And they're, you know, they're seven inches tall.

328
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,160
And you see these little girls wearing these big shoes.

329
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,400
And I just, I'm so scared when I see them because I feel like they're going to fall

330
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
over.

331
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,240
The other thing is that fashion is so expensive.

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,600
If you actually want to buy something that's in like an authentic, I don't know, Carolina

333
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,760
Herrera or Oscar de la Renta or something like that.

334
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
It's so expensive.

335
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
It is.

336
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,760
But you know, high fashion is expensive.

337
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
Fashion is not, doesn't have to be.

338
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,640
You can be fashionable just looking at different stores and going to secondhand shops and making

339
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
your own clothes.

340
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,720
I mean, it's all about a sense of personal style and dressing yourself to be unique.

341
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
Or you can get at the fake market.

342
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,960
Or you can go to the fake market.

343
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Exactly.

344
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
All right.

345
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
That's all the time we have for today, guys.

346
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,640
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

347
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,160
Please come to our website and comment at EnglishPod.com.

348
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,640
