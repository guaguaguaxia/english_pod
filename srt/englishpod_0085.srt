00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,680
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,200
And today we're bringing you another lesson on our sports series.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,600
We're talking about baseball today.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,480
Baseball, the American national pastime.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Is it?

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
Yes, it is.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Okay.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
So we're going to be looking at this interesting sport that is played mainly in the Caribbean

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
and well, it's actually very popular in the United States and Japan.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
That's right.

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Korea.

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Yep.

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,640
And we're going to learn a bunch of baseball language, but we're also going to see how

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,800
baseball has a big influence on English in general.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
That's right.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
So we're going to learn a lot of great things today.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:55,280
So why don't we start and listen to our dialogue?

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,520
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,520
My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here once again with the man that seals the

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,320
deal Bob Copeland.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,160
It's a beautiful day to see two world-class teams face each other and fight for their

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,800
right to be called champions.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,360
Well, the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,760
It's time to play ball.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,120
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,680
Pitcher winds up and strike one.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,560
Very nice curve ball by the pitcher.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,160
The catcher gives him the sign.

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,840
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,720
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,520
Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,840
The outfielder throws it to second.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Vargas slides.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
He's safe.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
Great play.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,480
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
There's the pitch.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,640
He hits it.

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
It's going, going.

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,760
That ball is gone.

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,320
Home run by Okami.

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,200
That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,840
Ritchie Stadium.

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,760
All right.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,400
Well, a pretty exciting game there at Ritchie Stadium.

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Exactly.

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,480
And we have some interesting players, Roger Vargas and Brian Okami.

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,880
All right.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,680
So well, we saw some great words and well, it's time for us to take a look at them now

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,300
in Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Okay.

55
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,640
We're going to look at some common sports and baseball words here.

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Now, the first phrase, we'll hear this almost at any sort of international sports event,

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,640
right?

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Exactly.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
And it's the national anthem.

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
National anthem.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
National anthem.

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,520
So, this is a song, right?

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Exactly.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,320
It's the song that you sing about your country and many people confuse it, right?

65
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Yeah.

66
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
A lot of people might say national hymn.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Okay.

68
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,760
Because in some languages, it might be like a hymn, like literally translating.

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Yeah.

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,040
But in English, it's called the national anthem.

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,280
The national anthem.

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
All right.

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,320
So, what about our next word?

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Well, we were talking about the pitcher.

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Pitcher.

76
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
P-I-T-C-H-E-R.

77
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
The pitcher.

78
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Pitcher.

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Okay.

80
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,360
And now, this is one of the players on the baseball team and his job is to?

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
To throw the ball.

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,280
To throw the ball really fast.

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,240
So that the guy can hit it with the bat.

84
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Okay.

85
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
So, that's the pitcher.

86
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,440
Now, the interesting thing is that the baseball commentator said the pitcher winds up.

87
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,600
Winds up.

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,640
To wind up.

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
To wind up.

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Okay.

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Well, let me paint you a picture.

92
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Okay.

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
So, imagine a clock.

94
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Uh-huh.

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,440
And you're turning, turning, and turning the clock to wind it up, to get it ready to go.

96
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
To make it work.

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Exactly.

98
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Uh-huh.

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,840
And the pitcher is doing the same sort of thing, bringing his arm back behind him, getting

100
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,360
ready to throw the ball.

101
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Okay.

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
So, that is to wind up.

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Uh-huh.

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Very good.

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,520
So, you can use this word not only in baseball, but for other things that require you to do

106
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
this action.

107
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Right.

108
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,520
To turn something and get it ready to have lots of power.

109
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Like some toys.

110
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah.

111
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,880
Or maybe like a music box.

112
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Uh-huh.

113
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Okay.

114
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Wind up.

115
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
What about our next phrase?

116
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,720
Well, Roger Vargas hit a line drive.

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Line drive.

118
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Line drive.

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Okay.

120
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
So, what is a line drive?

121
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,840
Well, it's a term from baseball.

122
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,520
And when you hit a line drive, you hit the ball sort of low on towards the ground, and

123
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,440
it travels along the outside of the field.

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Right.

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,400
So, the ball basically travels along the foul line.

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Uh-huh.

127
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
That white line.

128
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
The white line.

129
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Yeah.

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Exactly.

131
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Very good.

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
So, that's a line drive.

133
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,920
And so, the players on the field were scrambling to get the ball.

134
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Scrambling.

135
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Now, we know scrambled eggs from one of our lessons.

136
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Yes.

137
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,320
But the verb to scramble means to move quickly in a disorganized way to do something.

138
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Okay.

139
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
So, the players are moving very fast, trying to get the ball, but they're not doing it

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
very well.

141
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Right.

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
And you can use this in other ways, right?

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Not just in baseball.

144
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Right.

145
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,960
For example, we can say, the people are scrambling to buy their tickets for the concert.

146
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah.

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,200
Or, I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I'm scrambling to get everything ready.

148
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Exactly.

149
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,720
It's a very good term that you can use also in your daily life.

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Exactly.

151
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
All right.

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,040
And what about our last word for today on Language Takeaway?

153
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,720
Well, they were in the fifth inning of the game.

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Okay.

155
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
So, inning.

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Inning.

157
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Inning.

158
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
All right.

159
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
This is another baseball term.

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Uh-huh.

161
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,440
And it just means the period of play.

162
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Okay.

163
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
So, we learned, for example, that in soccer you have two halves.

164
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Uh-huh.

165
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Or, in hockey, you have three periods.

166
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
All right.

167
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
And in baseball, you have nine innings.

168
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Okay.

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Great.

170
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,000
So, some interesting sports and baseball vocabulary.

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,840
Now, I think it'll help us to hear this again slower.

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,720
So, let's listen to the dialogue.

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,320
Hello, baseball fans, and welcome back to today's game.

174
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,880
My name is Rick Fields, and of course, I am here once again with the man that seals the

175
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,000
deal, Bob Copeland.

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,160
It's a beautiful day to see two world-class teams face each other and fight for their

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,320
right to be called champions.

178
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,160
Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game.

179
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,680
It's time to play ball.

180
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,360
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

181
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,280
The pitcher winds up and strike one.

182
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,320
A very nice curveball by the pitcher.

183
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,640
The catcher gives him the sign.

184
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,520
He winds up, and Vargas gets a line drive.

185
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,840
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

186
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,920
Vargas gets to first base, and he's still going.

187
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,880
The outfielder throws it to second.

188
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
Vargas slides.

189
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
He's safe.

190
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,000
Great play.

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,920
We have a runner on third, and up at bat is Brian Okami.

192
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
There's the pitch.

193
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
He hits it.

194
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,740
It's going, going.

195
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,760
That ball is gone.

196
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,860
Home run by Okami.

197
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,400
That puts this team ahead by two, as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,040
Ritchie Stadium.

199
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:34,920
All right, so as we said, there are a lot of English terms that come from baseball,

200
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,280
but we use them in business context or in your daily life, right?

201
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah, why don't we look at those now in Fluency Builder.

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,880
Fluency Builder.

203
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,840
All right, so the first phrase that we have is, up to bat.

204
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,520
Up to bat.

205
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Up to bat.

206
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,480
So literally, in this dialogue, it means the guy is standing on home plate, ready to hit

207
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
the ball, right?

208
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Right.

209
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
He has the bat, and he's ready to hit it.

210
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,880
But what about in other contexts?

211
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,660
So for example, you can be at a meeting, and maybe it's your turn to talk.

212
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,880
So you're up to bat.

213
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,960
So exactly.

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,320
Your boss will say, okay, Erica, you're up to bat.

215
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,280
Okay, so it means sort of like it's your turn.

216
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
It's your turn.

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Yeah.

218
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Very good.

219
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,540
All right, so that's another term that is used in baseball, but very commonly used in

220
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,220
other circumstances.

221
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,720
So we also saw in the dialogue that Roger Vegas, he hit the ball, but he missed, and

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,840
that was strike one.

223
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Right.

224
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Strike one.

225
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,280
So in baseball, you have three strikes.

226
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Three tries.

227
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,800
Three tries before you're out.

228
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Yes.

229
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,040
And so now, the same thing happens in daily life.

230
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,480
So if someone says, that was strike one.

231
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,360
It means you made the first mistake.

232
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Yes.

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
And if you make two more, you will be fired, for example.

234
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Or maybe your parents will say, okay, that wasn't nice.

235
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Strike one.

236
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
And then two more times, and you'll have a timeout.

237
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
Or you'll be grounded.

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Yes.

239
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,640
Okay, so that's also called a strike.

240
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
And the pitcher threw a curve ball.

241
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
A curve ball.

242
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Curve ball.

243
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
So, okay, pretty clear.

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
A curve ball is when you throw the ball, and it sort of goes in a curve.

245
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,320
It doesn't go straight, right?

246
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Right.

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Exactly.

248
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,760
But how can this be used outside of baseball?

249
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,440
So you can say, oh, my boss threw me a curve ball today.

250
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,680
So he gave you an unexpected problem.

251
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Uh-huh.

252
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,880
Or something that was difficult to handle.

253
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Okay.

254
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
This one is pretty interesting.

255
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
We'd like to hear a few more examples.

256
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Example one.

257
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,880
My boss threw me a curve ball today, so I have to stay and work late.

258
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,800
Example two.

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,880
It was a huge curve ball when she asked me how many kids I wanted to have.

260
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
How am I supposed to know?

261
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,000
All right, so that's basically a curve ball.

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,560
You can say an unexpected problem or situation.

263
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
That's right.

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,760
And our last phrase, and probably one that you already know, home run.

265
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
A home run.

266
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
A home run.

267
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,880
From baseball, we know that that's when you hit the ball really far.

268
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,640
And you hit it outside of the playing area, outside the park.

269
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes.

270
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
And now if you use it in a business context or in your daily life.

271
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
It means something similar.

272
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,920
Why don't we take a listen to the examples and see if we can figure it out.

273
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,960
Example one.

274
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,280
Great job on that sales presentation.

275
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,880
You really hit a home run.

276
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,280
Example two.

277
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,320
Our sales team hit a home run this month by doubling our revenue.

278
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Okay, so basically a home run is a success.

279
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
A victory.

280
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
A victory.

281
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Yeah, something, a big accomplishment.

282
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
That's right.

283
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,920
So we've seen a lot of these great phrases.

284
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,640
And as you can see, a lot of them from baseball are used in your daily life.

285
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
And there are many, many more.

286
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,760
Okay, well, why don't we hear them again in the baseball context.

287
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:20,480
And we'll listen to the dialogue one more time.

288
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game.

289
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,760
My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here once again with the man that seals the

290
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,560
deal Bob Copeland.

291
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,400
It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their

292
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,040
right to be called champions.

293
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,600
Well, the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game.

294
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,000
It's time to play ball.

295
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,360
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

296
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
Pitcher winds up and strike one.

297
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,800
Very nice curve ball by the pitcher.

298
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
The catcher gives him the sign.

299
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,040
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

300
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,600
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

301
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,760
Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

302
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
The outfielder throws it to second.

303
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Vargas slides.

304
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
He's safe.

305
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,480
Great play.

306
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,720
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami.

307
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
There's the pitch.

308
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
He hits it.

309
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,440
It's going, going.

310
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
That ball is gone.

311
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,560
Home run by Okami.

312
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,400
That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at

313
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,720
Ritchie Stadium.

314
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
All right.

315
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,200
So an interesting dialogue, a very interesting sport.

316
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
And well, personally, I never played this as a child.

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,520
Me neither, really.

318
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,440
I don't really like it too much, but it is kind of fun to go to a game and especially

319
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,480
in the United States, have those hot dogs and all that.

320
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
OK, yeah.

321
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Well, a cultural event, a really important piece of American culture.

322
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Exactly.

323
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,240
