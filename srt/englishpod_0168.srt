00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,720
And my name is Catherine and today we have an advanced media level lesson so that's the

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
very highest of our levels.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Right.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,320
And we're going to be talking about a very popular tradition in North America, a Thanksgiving

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
dinner.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,880
Okay, so Thanksgiving is a very special holiday for Americans and Canadians also celebrate

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
it.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
And different dates, right?

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
Canadians have it on a different date.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,320
In fact, I'm not sure what the Canadian date is but Americans celebrate it at the end of

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
November.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,400
The day changes every year because it's a Thursday.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,520
But we usually have the day off from work or school and we all eat together and celebrate

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,800
the year and celebrate the harvest and celebrate our families and friends.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,200
So this tradition of Thanksgiving, what do you commemorate or what do you celebrate?

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,960
Well, we actually celebrate the first harvest that the pilgrims had when they were right

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,960
off the boat in New England.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
So that's the eastern part of America.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,600
These people had come from England and they were trying to find a new land and a new life

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,280
and they ended up in the Massachusetts area and they didn't know how to farm.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,920
They didn't know how to work the land.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,840
And so the Native Americans who were living there at the time helped them out, helped

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,440
them grow corn, helped them find out how to use the land in a productive way.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,040
And so when that first harvest happened, everyone was able to grow, it was actually a year after

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,600
they arrived, everyone was able to grow corn and food and crops and then they all shared

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,560
a meal together to celebrate this wonderful occasion.

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Wow.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
And it actually helped them survive the winter because most of the pilgrims, most of the

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
settlers, they died during the first winter.

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,200
And so this was a really great, great thing for them.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Wow.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
That's really interesting, an interesting aspect of history and why this is celebrated

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,560
mostly as you say in North America and Canada and that's why many other countries don't

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
really have it.

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,440
It's a popular get together and what you usually have is a turkey, right?

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Exactly.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,640
So a turkey is a very big bird and they go gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,000
And they have that kind of really red long kind of thing on their necks and big tail

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,040
or big tail feathers.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,560
And they're delicious.

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,280
But the funny thing is about turkey that there's a chemical in it that makes you very sleepy.

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,680
Well, not a chemical, there's a protein in it that makes you very sleepy.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Oh really?

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
I didn't know that.

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,600
So after you eat dinner on Thanksgiving, everyone falls asleep on the sofa.

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,280
Well, Thanksgiving meals in the United States are very, very big.

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,680
They're very elaborate, right?

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
You'll not only have turkey, but you have pumpkin pie and you have mashed potatoes and

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
gravy and just like a table full of food.

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Exactly.

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,400
And it's a way to celebrate, well to give thanks for all the things that you have.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,520
And so we like to cook a lot of food to celebrate that.

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,360
And they're all fall foods.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,320
So squash, pumpkin, potatoes, things like that.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Alright.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,120
So we have a dialogue here.

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,760
So it's just that.

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,960
It's a guy who is preparing a turkey dinner and also preparing pumpkin pie.

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
But he's doing it in a very peculiar way.

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,240
So why don't we listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and just talk a little

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:22,120
bit about the different terms that he used.

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,560
Hello everyone and welcome back to our show.

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Today we are going to learn how to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,280
I will share a secret that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook the perfect,

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
most mouthwatering, juiciest turkey in the world.

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Let's get started.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,160
First of all, we must bring out our key ingredient, whiskey.

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,720
You see, the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol brings out the flavor of

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
the turkey meat.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,240
Let's pour one cup of whiskey on the turkey and serve yourself a cup as well.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,960
Cheers!

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,600
Ah, that's good 12 year whiskey right there.

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Okay, back to our turkey.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,280
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit.

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Now have another cup of whiskey.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:18,040
Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a roasting pan.

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,140
Let's add some whiskey to give it some extra flavor.

80
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,640
And let's have another cup.

81
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,760
That hit the spot.

82
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
There we go.

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,040
We can leave it in there for the next 45 minutes.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,200
In the meantime, let's have another sip of whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin

85
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,840
pie.

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,200
Lightly whisk together two eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.

87
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:55,240
Once that's ready, we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,480
with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan.

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,560
Gently bring up to simmering point, stirring occasionally.

90
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,380
Now you may notice that we are using some dark rum in this pie.

91
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,020
This is because the richness of the pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum.

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,480
So to celebrate this great occasion, pour yourself a glass.

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,440
Cheers!

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,880
Now that we have finished with the filling, let's bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes until

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,560
the filling has puffed up around the edges and the center is almost set.

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
All done!

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,560
A cup of rum to celebrate the completion of this great Thanksgiving dinner.

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,640
After waiting for an hour and having a couple of drinks, it's time to check on our turkey.

99
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Take the turkey out of the oven.

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,720
Pick the turkey off of the ground.

101
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe.

102
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Now also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot.

103
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:15,840
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving!

104
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,960
All right we're back so I think this is going to be one great Thanksgiving dinner for him.

105
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh my gosh and talking about this is making me so hungry.

106
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,200
This always happens when we have food lessons.

107
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,840
What about do you have any family members who actually drink a little bit too much during

108
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Thanksgiving?

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,800
Yes and I won't say who.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,380
So as he was preparing the Thanksgiving dinner, he mentioned a couple of things.

111
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,400
For example, a mouth-watering turkey.

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,660
Mouth-watering so this is a way to say appetizing.

113
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,960
You know when you see something delicious on TV and your mouth starts to water, you're

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
salivating.

115
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,160
It's like your brain is telling you that you want to eat it.

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,480
And so your mouth starts to water.

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,800
So we say that something that's very appetizing, something that looks like it will taste very

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
very good, it's mouth-watering.

119
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,760
All right so he was preparing a mouth-watering turkey.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,480
So moving on, he mentioned that he had a key ingredient for his turkey and it was whiskey.

121
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,760
Not only whiskey but 12-year whiskey.

122
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,160
Okay so the thing about whiskey is that oftentimes on the label of a bottle they'll advertise

123
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,600
how old the whiskey is because you pay more for older whiskeys.

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,640
They just have better taste in many cases.

125
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
In this case it's a 12-year whiskey.

126
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,200
That means that it was stored in a cask for 12 years to let it age and then they sell

127
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,280
it after 12 years and so that's the special ingredient.

128
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,760
That's the special ingredient, 12-year whiskey.

129
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,880
And well he not only put it on the turkey but also he had a couple of drinks himself

130
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,920
and in one of those he mentioned that hit the spot.

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
That hit the spot.

132
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
What spot?

133
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
The spot.

134
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,160
Okay so this is a really common phrase in English that we use to say that something

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,980
is very satisfying.

136
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
So that hit the spot.

137
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,360
And not only for drinks right?

138
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,160
No you could use it for food or anything really.

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,120
So in this case I could say, oh so hungry that sandwich really hit the spot.

140
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,640
I really needed to eat right now and that sandwich was perfect.

141
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
That was perfect.

142
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Alright.

143
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,280
So that hit the spot.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,840
Now when he referred to the turkey, in one occasion he said we place our bird on a rack.

145
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,120
Alright so what's a bird and what's the rack?

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,500
Okay so this is really interesting.

147
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,880
We talk about the turkey often times when we're making commercials or talking about

148
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,720
recipes as the bird.

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,640
So you want to take out the bird, you want to open the packaging.

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,240
So the bird is the turkey.

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,160
A turkey is a kind of bird.

152
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,560
You can say this about chicken as well because it's another kind of bird.

153
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,080
But this is kind of a colloquial term in cooking for whatever bird you're cooking.

154
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Right.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Okay.

156
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
And when you're placing it on a rack, what's a rack?

157
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay so in our ovens, an oven is a kitchen appliance that you have that heats up food.

158
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
But it's not like a microwave, it's much stronger.

159
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,520
And so inside there are metal bars.

160
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,140
We don't have, they're like shelves but they're open.

161
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,800
And so these metal bars are called a rack.

162
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,640
So you put the turkey in the oven on the rack.

163
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,680
Right, you can't put it on the base of the oven because then it would burn up.

164
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Exactly.

165
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,560
And you don't have a shelf because that would be a problem.

166
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,720
Alright.

167
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,040
And well, moving on the instructions when he was preparing the pumpkin pie, he told

168
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,840
us to lightly whisk together two eggs.

169
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,520
So we have a verb here, to whisk.

170
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
To whisk.

171
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,880
So that's not only a verb but a noun as well, right?

172
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Alright.

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
It's an instrument.

174
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Exactly.

175
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
And this is a verb we often use with eggs.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,880
So to whisk eggs.

177
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,760
You can also whisk like sauce for a salad, so like a salad dressing.

178
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,140
But it's a way that we stir something.

179
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,560
And so oftentimes we have an instrument called a whisk that's not like a fork.

180
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,080
It actually looks kind of funny.

181
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,560
It's got bars on it.

182
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,040
Like wire that kind of make a circle.

183
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Exactly.

184
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
And they are very thin wires.

185
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,760
And you usually stir very, very, very quickly.

186
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,880
Especially if you have eggs, this will break up the egg and it becomes kind of like foamy.

187
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,040
Foamy, yeah.

188
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,520
To make like an omelet for example.

189
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Exactly.

190
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,440
So to whisk is a kind of, it's a way to stir.

191
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Okay.

192
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,800
And then he mentioned some ingredients such as sugar, spices, and grated nutmeg.

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
So what is this verb, grated nutmeg?

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,320
Or an adjective, grated.

195
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Exactly.

196
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
So this adjective, grated, means that, well it's a kind of way to cut up something.

197
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,480
And so you often hear the term grated cheese.

198
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,420
That means not a big chunk of cheese, but we push it against a board to get little pieces

199
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,800
of it to fall off.

200
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,380
And that's called grated cheese.

201
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,300
And so in this case we have grated nutmeg.

202
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,000
That means that it's been kind of, the nutmeg comes in, in very small pieces.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, pieces.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,640
And we're breaking it down.

205
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
All right.

206
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Very good.

207
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,160
And he also mentioned something about bringing the sauce to a simmering point.

208
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,680
What is that simmering point?

209
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,280
Okay, simmering point is a time when you're cooking where the liquid goes from being calm

210
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,000
to being very agitated and moving.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But it's not boiling, right?

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,880
No, boiling means you have big bubbles.

213
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Right.

214
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,940
Like boiling water.

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,480
But simmering is where it's kind of little bubbles, there's a little bit of action on

216
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
the surface of the liquid, but it's not boiling.

217
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,720
It's in the middle between flat and calm and agitated and boiling.

218
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,600
Okay, so that's the simmering point.

219
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
Very good.

220
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,640
And that's pretty much all of the interesting phrases in the dialogue.

221
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
There are a lot more, but we don't really have time to cover that huge amount of rich

222
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
vocabulary.

223
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:14,120
Why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

224
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,560
Hello everyone and welcome back to our show.

225
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,360
Today we are going to learn how to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey.

226
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,280
I will share a secret that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook the perfect,

227
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,640
most mouthwatering, juiciest turkey in the world.

228
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,440
Let's get started.

229
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,160
First of all, we must bring out our key ingredient, whiskey.

230
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,720
You see, the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol brings out the flavor of

231
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,000
the turkey meat.

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,360
Let's pour one cup of whiskey on the turkey and serve yourself a cup as well.

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,960
Cheers!

234
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,600
Ah, that's good 12-year whiskey right there.

235
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Okay, back to our turkey.

236
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,280
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit.

237
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Now have another cup of whiskey.

238
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:10,000
Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a roasting pan.

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,120
Let's add some whiskey to give it some extra flavor.

240
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,600
And let's have another cup.

241
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,760
That hit the spot.

242
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
There we go.

243
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
We can leave it in there for the next 45 minutes.

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,200
In the meantime, let's have another sip of whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,840
pie.

246
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,200
Lightly whisk together two eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.

247
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:47,260
Once that's ready, we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon

248
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,480
with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan.

249
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,560
Gently bring up to simmering point, stirring occasionally.

250
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,380
Now you may notice that we are using some dark rum in this pie.

251
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:06,020
This is because the richness of the pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum.

252
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,480
So to celebrate this great occasion, pour yourself a glass.

253
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,440
Cheers!

254
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,880
Now that we have finished with the filling, let's bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes until

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,560
the filling has puffed up around the edges and the center is almost set.

256
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
All done!

257
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,120
A cup of rum to celebrate the completion of this great Thanksgiving dinner.

258
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:42,660
After waiting for an hour and having a couple of drinks, it's time to check on our turkey.

259
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,520
Take the turkey out of the oven.

260
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,720
Pick the turkey off of the ground.

261
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,920
Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe.

262
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,760
Now also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot.

263
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,280
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving!

264
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Alright, we're back.

265
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,960
So Thanksgiving dinner, really popular.

266
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,480
Catherine, have you ever cooked or are you into the whole Thanksgiving feast?

267
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
I'm very into it.

268
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,320
It's my favorite holiday in America, mostly because everyone gets to celebrate it.

269
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,680
It's not religious, so you don't have to worry about other people not celebrating it or not

270
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
knowing what to do.

271
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,240
And it's also a celebration about family and food.

272
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,820
And so it's just a wonderful experience to have Thanksgiving because you're with everybody.

273
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,320
And we always say in America that if someone doesn't have a place to go on Thanksgiving,

274
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,040
you should invite them to your house.

275
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,880
And so it's a very inviting and warm holiday.

276
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,040
And I love cooking and I love being in the kitchen and I love having people in the house

277
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,120
cooking and so yeah, I've definitely been a part of the cooking side of things.

278
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,400
Now in many movies, they kind of mock this holiday because it's a time where everyone

279
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,560
gets together, as you say, no matter religion, creed or race.

280
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,840
And that also causes for a lot of family members to get together and argue and have discussions

281
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,520
about politics or talk about family problems and stuff like that.

282
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,480
So what do you think of that?

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,840
Well, I think it's an exaggeration, but it happens.

284
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,280
People get very stressed out during the holidays.

285
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,240
They call it the holidays because this is beginning where you have Thanksgiving and

286
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,200
then later Christmas.

287
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,800
But I personally don't have experience with that really on Thanksgiving because it's such

288
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,160
a happy holiday for us.

289
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,840
So and in my family, arguments about politics and history and all that is very encouraged.

290
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,320
And so it's just a part of the holiday where we have, we have, you know, one person at

291
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
the table who says this and the other person says this and you're all drinking and it's

292
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
just, it's fun.

293
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
I look forward to it.

294
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
All right.

295
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Very good.

296
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,760
So if you guys have any other questions or doubts about this holiday, because as we say,

297
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,840
it's very common in North America and Canada, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

298
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,640
And if you have any other questions or suggestions, you can leave those there as well.

299
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,400
We look forward to hearing what you have to say and happy Thanksgiving.

300
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Happy Thanksgiving.

301
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Bye everyone.

302
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Happy Thanksgiving.
