00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello English learners, welcome back. We are here at EnglishPod. I am joined with Erica.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my partner in crime, Marco.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Alright, so today we're going to be talking about a really great topic, one of my favorites.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Beer.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Beer. So beer is a very popular drink, especially in bars and when you go out.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, it's very common with students, I think.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes, and it's also not very strong like a vodka or whiskey.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, so we are going to be at a bar today and we're going to be looking at some of this vocabulary that you would find.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, I mean you've got to know this beer vocabulary.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at these words.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey man, what do you have on tap?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Heineken and Budweiser. We have a two for one happy hour special.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Cool, give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay. Pint of Heineken, half pint of Bud for table six. What about some appetizers?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sure, let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, that'll be 80 bucks.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, it's pretty expensive for two beers and some food.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, well, it happens sometimes you go to these very exclusive bars and they charge you like if it was gold.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I mean, that's crazy.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, let's take a look at some of these great words that we saw in Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Our first word is on tap.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
On tap.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
On tap.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So he asked, what do you have on tap? Now, this is a strange sentence. What exactly does it mean?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, well, he's asking about what beers the bar has.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But not in a bottle or not in a can, right?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right. So, you know, in a bar, there's often this machine, right?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That will pour a very fresh beer, right, directly into the glass.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Into the glass. Yeah, this is a very popular thing because like you say, it's fresh beer.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, it tastes better.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tastes better.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, so what do you have on tap?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What do you have on tap?

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right, let's take a look at our second word. Happy hour.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, this is very common and popular with bars.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What is it when they have a happy hour?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, a happy hour is a period of time where the drinks are very cheap.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, so happy hour could be from 5 p.m. till 10 p.m., 50% off.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If the drink is $4, then it is now $2 in happy hour.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, perfect. And this brings us to our third word, a special.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A special.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A special.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A special.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, this is a noun and what does it mean when a restaurant or a bar has a special?

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's like they're having a sale.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A sale.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, things are cheaper.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, it could be, for example, a Monday night special.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or like in the dialogue, a happy hour special.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, so it is a promotion.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, very good.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And now, they ordered a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Budweiser.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Pint.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a very, very special beer word.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So, a pint is the size of your glass.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, so we understand how much a pint is.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What would be the equivalent in liters?

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A pint is 0.4 liters.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, so almost half a liter is one pint.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, it is very common when you go into a bar, you can order a pint of beer.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, exactly. In English, we don't say, I'll have half a liter of beer.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Right, right. So, let's take a look at our next word on Language Takeaway.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Appetizers.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Appetizers.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Appetizers.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Appetizers.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, so what is an appetizer?

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, it is food you eat before your dinner or before your lunch.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, so it's usually maybe like a salad.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or a soup or something small that you can eat right before your big meal.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, so some common appetizers at a bar and we saw them in our dialogue.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Nachos and mozzarella sticks.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Nachos.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nachos.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Nachos.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Nachos.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, nachos are little chips, right?

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, corn chips and it has cheese and maybe some tomatoes and maybe some beans.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, so those are nachos. They are very common in the United States.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, yeah.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And what about mozzarella sticks?

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mozzarella sticks, a travesty on the world and humanity and everyone's arteries.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, mozzarella is a cheese, right?

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Mozzarella cheese and this cheese is, what is it, how is it prepared?

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You put it in some bread crumbs and then you fry it in oil. You deep fry it.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And you don't like this?

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, this is terrible.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why? They are so good.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, my God.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because then you can dip it in a little sauce and it's delicious.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Marco, there are so many reasons why this is wrong.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All right, well, mozzarella sticks, a very popular bar food.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right, well, why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be able to hear these words in context at a slower speed.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, man, what do you have on tap?

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Heineken and Budweiser. We have a two for one happy hour special.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Cool. Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay. Pint of Heineken, half pint of Bud for table six.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What about some appetizers?

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sure. Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay. That'll be 80 bucks.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, so we saw some really good vocabulary words there and now let's take a look at putting it together.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Putting it together.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, in this lesson, we are going to look at one phrase that sometimes causes problems.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So let's listen to this phrase that we're talking about.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What about some appetizers?

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What about some appetizers?

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What about some appetizers?

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, so this phrase, what about?

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, I often hear people use it to ask a question.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So a common mistake is asking, what about your weekend?

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What about your new job?

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now, this is incorrect, right?

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You cannot use the phrase, what about, to ask a question about information.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So you, it cannot ask for information.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay, because in our dialogue, the bartender said, and what about some appetizers?

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right, because he is making a suggestion.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right, so he's saying, well, why don't you have some food?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, the phrase, what about, can be used to make a suggestion.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay, so I can say, what about going to the movies?

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know what, let's hear a few more examples of this, because I think it's really useful.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Example one.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What about these dirty clothes?

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You said you would wash them days ago.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Example two.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What about going to the mall instead?

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm tired of going to the movies.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Example three.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What about a pizza instead of noodles?

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Alright, so really good examples, and the same thing we can apply to how about.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Exactly, so again, how about cannot ask for information.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So you can't say, how about your boss?

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Alright, perfect.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So let's listen to this dialogue one last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about bars and beers.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey man, what do you have on tap?

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Heineken and Budweiser.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We have a two for one happy hour special.

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Cool, give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Pint of Heineken, half pint of Bud for table six.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You want some appetizers?

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sure, let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, that'll be 80 bucks.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What?

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well Marco, I know you're a big fan of beer, and actually I think everyone here at Praxis is a big beer drinker.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And this is the perfect opportunity to tell everyone about the world renowned beer shake.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh my gosh.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, Marco.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Alright, so everyone that listens to this recipe is a non-believer.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They say that it is not possible for it to taste good.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But here's the recipe.

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You take a liter of beer, or maybe half a liter.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So a pint.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A pint or a pint and a half.

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And you put it in the blender.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Alright.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now you take two eggs.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, not cooked, not boiled, anything.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You take two eggs and put them in the blender.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It could be one or two.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then you take about half a cup of sugar, put it in the blender.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What?

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And you mix all that together and you get this really good foamy delicious beer shake.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So a beer milkshake.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, it has no milk.

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But it's actually really good.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've prepared it for some people who are like, no, that's not possible, it can't taste good.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And in the end, they're like, wow, this is actually pretty good.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So did you invent this recipe?

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's actually really common in Ecuador, in Peru.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've even seen it in Chile, usually with a dark beer.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Right.

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So like a Guinness or?

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It could be a Guinness.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's that a dark beer is a little bit sweeter, so you wouldn't add so much sugar.

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But if you have another beer like a lager or a stout, you could still do it,

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but just add a little bit more sugar because that beer is a little bit more bitter.

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, I am not going to try this recipe, but maybe you guys are.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You should.

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Try it out and let me know how it works.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
