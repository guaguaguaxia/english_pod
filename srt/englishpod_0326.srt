00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,980
My name is Catherine and today we have a lesson for you all about school.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,980
That's right.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,240
Today we're going to take a look at a child's report card.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,840
So we're going to talk a little bit about what this means, what is a report card and

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,760
also everything that's inside this report.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
That's right.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,400
So we're going to learn how to describe a child's schoolwork.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Is it good?

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Is it bad?

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,760
So let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a minute to discuss the meaning

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
of some of these words and phrases.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,720
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's have a look.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
What is this?

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,940
Where are all the grades?

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,040
He's in the third grade, Sam.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,840
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
one to three.

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,000
A one means his achievement or work is excellent.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,640
What about here in physical education?

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,760
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,560
We should work on that with him.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
So confusing.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam, we would get

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,080
an F. All right, we're back.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,440
So now let's start with some language takeaway.

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,120
Language takeaway.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,160
All right, the first phrase here we have in language takeaway is actually a thing.

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,760
It's the report card and this is the topic of today's dialogue.

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
That's right.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,080
Now you may remember, I'm sure pretty much it's standard everywhere in the world.

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,000
You get a report, a small little report that tells your parents how well or how poorly

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,820
you are doing in school.

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
That's right.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,480
And then after maybe two or three months, your teacher will write down how she or he

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,160
thinks that you're performing at school.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
That's right.

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,000
And usually parents have to sign this.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,160
They have to say, okay, I see that my child is doing well or that he's doing poorly and

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,680
then the teacher will know as well.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,700
And I think, well, you get report cards in elementary school, in high school and also

45
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,960
in university, right?

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
You do get a report card of some sort.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
That's right.

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,160
Well, in university in America, we call them grades.

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
We don't really call them a report card.

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,280
In high school, middle school and elementary school, so before college, we actually have

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,800
a piece of paper and that's why it's called a card.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,080
I think now for universities especially, you just go online and you see your grades.

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
That's right.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
It's on the internet.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
But the important thing about the report card is that it tells a parent and a student what

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
his or her grades are.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
That's right.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,520
So, grades, this is a noun, is basically your score.

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
That's right.

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,240
So, maybe you took a test and you did very well on your test and you had some homework

62
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,480
and you did very well on your homework, so you have a good grade.

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
That's right.

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,320
But if you don't do your homework and you don't do well on your test, you have a bad

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
grade.

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
That's right.

67
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,240
So, for example, like in the United States, it's over 100 points.

68
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,920
So maybe a good grade would be 95 points out of 100.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,080
So we call that an A. That's called an A. That's right.

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,440
Or if you have a bad grade, maybe that's an F, which is 20% or 30%.

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Right.

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Okay.

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,560
So now, this is where we need to make a difference between the grades that his father was looking

74
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,800
for and then the mom says he's in the third grade.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,680
So it's very different between having good grades or bad grades and fifth grade or third

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
grade.

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
All right.

78
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Two different grades.

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
And we know this is confusing.

80
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm going to explain a little bit.

81
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,720
Third grade is actually the third year of elementary school.

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
That's right.

83
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,120
So in the American education system, we start in kindergarten and we have first grade, second

84
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,560
grade, third grade, all the way up until the end, which is 12th grade.

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
That's right.

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,480
So it's everything between when you're five years old and when you're 18 years old.

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,240
And each year at school is a grade, a level.

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
That's right.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,640
And as you said, it's a grade in different parts of the country.

90
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm not really sure if they call them a grades or they have the same system, but basically,

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
that's what it means in English.

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,200
You have first grade, third grade, 12th grade, finally, when you graduate.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
That's right.

94
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,520
So you can say my son is in eighth grade.

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
That's right.

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,640
It means he's in his eighth year of school.

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Right.

98
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Very good.

99
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,720
So that is the difference.

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,480
And now, we're going to take a look at something that has to do with grades as well, is the

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,840
marks that you get in your test or in your report card.

102
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
That's right.

103
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
So this might actually help.

104
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
Remember when we said on your report card, your teacher might write down your grade.

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
That means do you have an A or a B or a C?

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,560
Well, another way to call this is a mark.

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,960
So he has good marks.

108
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,200
He has good grades.

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,040
So they're basically the same thing, grades and marks.

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
That's right.

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
They are.

112
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,760
And I know that in Britain, I think people more commonly say marks.

113
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,760
She got terrible marks at school and her father was angry with her.

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,880
But in America, we often say, if you get good grades, I'll buy you sweets.

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
That's right.

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Okay.

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
So you get a prize if you get good grades usually.

118
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Well, it depends on your parents.

119
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
On your parents.

120
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
That's right.

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,840
Now, as we said, you can have a grade that's usually a number or a letter like A, B, C,

122
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,920
D, F. But you can also get marks that are just very much black or white.

123
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,800
That's satisfactory or unsatisfactory, like in this case.

124
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
That's right.

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,880
So satisfactory, this is an adjective, it describes something, is a good thing.

126
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,280
So how did he do?

127
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,680
Well, his performance was satisfactory.

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
It's okay.

129
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,720
But if it's bad or if it's not good, we call it unsatisfactory.

130
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
That's right.

131
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,640
So this doesn't really have a number, as you can tell.

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,320
It's just basically pass or fail.

133
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
That's about it.

134
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Good or bad.

135
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Good or bad.

136
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
That's it.

137
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Exactly.

138
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
No grade.

139
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
And we'll explain this in a minute.

140
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,960
There are some classes where you can't have a grade like an A or a B. And that's why we

141
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,120
have this satisfactory, unsatisfactory.

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
That's right.

143
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
All right.

144
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
So we've taken a look at a lot of language there.

145
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,240
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

147
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Let's have a look.

148
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
What is this?

149
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Where are all the grades?

150
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
He's in the third grade, Sam.

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,320
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from

152
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
one to three.

153
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,480
A one means his achievement or work is excellent.

154
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,240
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

155
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,120
What about here in physical education?

156
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,240
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,040
We should work on that with him.

158
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
So confusing.

159
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,520
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get

160
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
an F.

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
All right.

162
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
We're back.

163
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,200
So now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,040
Fluency Builder.

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,960
You could have said, let's have a look, Marco.

166
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,720
That's one of the key phrases in today's dialogue.

167
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
That's right.

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,640
He, the dad, got the report card and he said, all right, let's have a look.

169
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:32,640
All right, this is a very common way to say, let's see, or let me look at that.

170
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
So let's have a look.

171
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,040
Maybe it's just one person, me, but we still say this, let, let us.

172
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
So it's plural.

173
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,680
It's very weird, but it just means let me look, let me see.

174
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
And exactly.

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,080
As you said, even though it's in plural and you may be by yourself or only you are going

176
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,840
to look at something, people still say, let's have a look.

177
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Let's have a look here.

178
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,760
It means I want to look at this, so if I say, Hey, I just bought this new CD.

179
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Okay.

180
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
I can say, Hey, let's have a look.

181
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
All right.

182
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,760
And I could give it to Marco and he can look at the case and see who the musician is.

183
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
That's right.

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
All right.

185
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,920
Now talking about one of the subjects in school, that means some of the classes that you have,

186
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,440
we had science, we have history, and there's another one called physical education.

187
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
All right.

188
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,400
So this is a class that has many different names.

189
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,960
It's physical, so you know that it has to do with your body.

190
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,640
So basically it's sports class and you play sports like football, basketball, things like

191
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
that.

192
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
It's also called PE.

193
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
PE for short.

194
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Yeah.

195
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,320
Because remember physical in English starts with a P, PH, physical.

196
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,320
But this is what I was saying earlier, Marco, you can't give a person an A or a B in physical

197
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
education.

198
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
Well, you don't really.

199
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,800
So normally students get satisfactory or unsatisfactory.

200
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,040
Because usually it doesn't mean that you have to be very good at sports.

201
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,240
Sometimes it's just the effort counts.

202
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,360
You may not be very good at soccer or football or basketball, but if you try really hard,

203
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,480
you're running around and you're actually doing what you're supposed to be doing, then

204
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,800
you get a satisfactory note.

205
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,960
It means, yeah, I mean, you're not the best player in the world, but you're doing what

206
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
you're supposed to.

207
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Exactly.

208
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
All right.

209
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,360
So now when the father was talking, he's like, oh, you know, I don't understand this report

210
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,760
card in my day, we got an A or a B.

211
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
All right.

212
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,960
So this is a common phrase that people say when they want to talk about when they were

213
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,000
children or when they were growing up.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,600
So older people often say, oh, in my day, things were different.

215
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,000
So this is a way to make a comparison between now and the past.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, right.

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,840
So you're basically saying when I was a child or many years ago, this was what happened

218
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,880
or this is how it used to be.

219
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
In my day, school was much more difficult.

220
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,920
Today, it's very, very easy.

221
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
That's right.

222
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,280
So this is how you start this comparison between the time when you were a child to now.

223
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Yes.

224
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
In my day.

225
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
All right.

226
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,720
And to finish off, we're going to talk about failing an exam because obviously sometimes

227
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
you do fail.

228
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Yeah.

229
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,840
So when you fail, fail an exam, you get a very bad grade, an F.

230
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
An F.

231
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
So F for fail.

232
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
It's easy to remember.

233
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
That's right.

234
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,720
So you say, you can say I didn't pass the exam, but you can also say I failed the exam.

235
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Yes.

236
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,480
And normally fail means you received less than 60%.

237
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
That's right.

238
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Or 50%.

239
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,280
So it's, yeah, 50%.

240
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,480
So basically you missed, if there are 10 questions on the exam, you missed five or six or seven

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,880
or all the way to 10 of them.

242
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,760
So you missed more than half of the questions.

243
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
That's right.

244
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
And it's not only for school.

245
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,320
For example, your driver's exam, when you're going to get your driver's license, you can

246
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,640
also pass or fail that exam.

247
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,840
And if you fail the exam, you have to take it again.

248
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
That's right.

249
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,200
So that's all the fluency builder words we have for you today.

250
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,120
Let's take a look at them again and we'll be right back.

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,800
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

252
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Let's have a look.

253
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
What is this?

254
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
Where are all the grades?

255
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
He's in the third grade, Sam.

256
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,920
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from

257
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,280
one to three.

258
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,080
A one means his achievement or work is excellent.

259
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,840
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

260
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
What about here in physical education?

261
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,840
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

262
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
We should work on that with him.

263
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
So confusing.

264
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,480
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well.

265
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
And if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

266
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
All right.

267
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
So big question, Marco.

268
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
When you were a student, did you get good grades?

269
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,720
I got good grades, but not great grades.

270
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,720
I was always the type of student that paid attention in class, did my homework, but never

271
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
studied.

272
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,840
Ah, so you did not study for the tests.

273
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,540
No, but that's why I never got an A, for example, or an A plus.

274
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,720
But I always got a B. So I was that type of just more chilled type of student.

275
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
You like to be in the middle.

276
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Yeah.

277
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Well, this was the thing.

278
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,800
I didn't like to pay attention in class, so that was different because I would pay attention,

279
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,400
I would take some notes, but then I would just remember everything.

280
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,840
So I did all right for the exam.

281
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,200
I didn't really have to study.

282
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,880
But sometimes in other subjects I did, I really liked them.

283
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
So it wasn't studying.

284
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,920
It was more fun for me.

285
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
So then I would get great grades.

286
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,960
What about you?

287
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,720
I always studied for tests.

288
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
Generally my grades were pretty good.

289
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,240
Now something that we didn't talk about here is a GPA.

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
This is something that is very popular in the United States.

291
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,920
Basically even if you want to apply for schools, your GPA is what counts.

292
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
What is a GPA?

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
That's right.

294
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,040
Well, we don't really have a GPA until high school, and then it's in high school and college.

295
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,080
And GPA stands for G-Grade P-Point A-Average.

296
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,000
So grade point average.

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,200
That means we take all of our marks or all of our grades together.

298
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,640
So science grade, English grade, history grade, and we make an average.

299
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:31,240
So if I get mostly A's, my GPA is 4.0.

300
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,800
If I get mostly B's, my GPA is 3.0.

301
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
And then it goes lower and lower.

302
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,560
And if you have a really bad GPA, like a 1, you probably won't finish high school.

303
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,040
Now the GPA is very important for many reasons.

304
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,600
First of all, because it's also kind of a summary of your application to universities,

305
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
right?

306
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
They take a look at your GPA.

307
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Absolutely.

308
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,120
So this is a way to say, okay, how is this student overall?

309
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,320
How is this student in all of her classes, not just one class?

310
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Right.

311
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,120
And then they see if you have a 3.5, they say, oh, well, it's pretty good.

312
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,360
Yeah, 3.5 is good.

313
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,880
4 is the best.

314
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,240
And again, a 3 is good, it's okay.

315
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,960
But a 2 or a 1 is not very good.

316
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
That's right.

317
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,040
So it's very interesting because all around the world, they have different grading systems.

318
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,080
I think I would say that the United States is the only place where I've seen that they

319
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,120
use the A, B, C, D, F system.

320
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,520
In Latin American countries, for example, they don't do it over 100, they do it over

321
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
10.

322
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,480
So you would get a grade over 10.

323
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,800
Or in some countries, over 20.

324
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
I've seen that as well.

325
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
In Italy, it's not.

326
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
It's over 20.

327
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
So you would get a 14, I think, would be a passing grade over 20.

328
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,360
Well, let us know, listeners, if you have a different grading system in your country.

329
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Also, you can let us know how were your grades when you're studying in school.

330
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,360
You don't have to tell us, but we'd like to talk to you about grades.

331
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,800
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

332
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
All right.

333
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
We'll see you guys there.

334
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Bye.

335
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:13,700
This is Inner Circle, signing off.
