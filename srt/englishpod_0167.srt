00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,800
And my name is Catherine and today we're going on a little driving lesson.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
That's right.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,440
We're going to learn how to drive, but not only how to drive, but all the vocabulary

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,680
and words associated to this activity.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,120
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and we'll be back to explain

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,120
it.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:35,740
Okay, I'm ready for my driving lesson.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,380
Should I start the car?

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,080
Hold on there, Fittipaldi.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,580
First let's go over things one more time.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,680
Now before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,680
position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,840
Next, check your rearview mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,840
We've been through this a million times.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,960
Let's get going already.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm ready.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Fine.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Start the car.

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,600
Okay, now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Good.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,440
Now, accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
There we go.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Good.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
I'm doing it.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm driving.

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
This is awesome.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Let's turn some music on.

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Keep your eyes on the road.

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
No music.

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,440
We are coming up to a red light.

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Step on the brakes.

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
What are you doing?

35
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I said the brakes.

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Look out for those people.

37
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Get off the sidewalk.

38
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Get out of my way.

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,440
This is just like playing video games.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
It's the police.

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Pull over.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,440
They'll never take me alive.

43
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,440
All right.

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Great.

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,440
So, it's a great driving lesson just like the video games.

46
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Well, hopefully not like video games.

47
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
We don't want to hurt anyone.

48
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
But that comes a little bit later.

49
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,440
First, let's check out some of these very important phrases in today's Language Takeaway.

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
All right.

52
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,440
So, on Language Takeaway, we have five words for you today.

53
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Starting with the first one, the steering wheel.

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Okay, steering wheel.

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,440
So, this comes from the fact that we have a wheel that we use to turn the car left and

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
right.

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,440
And so, that's called to steer, to change the direction of something.

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,440
So, the verb to steer is to take it left or right.

59
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Exactly.

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
So, steering wheel is the instrument that we use to change the car's direction.

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Very good.

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,440
And, well, apart from this instrument, also in order to look to other cars that are behind

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,440
you, you would look at your rear view mirror.

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Great.

65
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
So, rear view mirror.

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
This is a mirror that you have in front of you in the middle of the car.

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
And you look at this mirror to find out if there are cars behind you.

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
So, it's a rear view.

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
That means you're looking at the back.

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Rear means back or behind.

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,440
What about the mirrors that are on the side of the car, on the doors?

72
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Those are called side view mirrors.

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Side view mirrors.

74
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Very literal.

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Okay, very good.

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,440
And, well, moving on, he was instructing her on how to drive and he said, step on the clutch.

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Well, this is an important word for those of you who are driving manual cars.

78
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,440
It means that you have to control the way that the gas goes into the engine by yourself.

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,440
And so, a clutch is a pedal.

80
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,440
It's the third pedal on the left and you push this pedal to change gears.

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
So, some cars, they don't have this.

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
For those of you who don't, don't worry about it.

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
But if you do, a clutch is on the far left.

84
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
It's the third pedal.

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Okay, so this is for a manual car, manual transmission car because many people have

86
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,440
automatics where you just accelerate and the car automatically changes gears.

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Exactly.

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,440
And so, a lot of Europeans drive manual cars and have this clutch.

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Okay, so you step on the clutch and in order to change gear, you say to shift into first gear.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,440
That's right because if you're driving, you know that you can't go from first to fifth gear, right?

91
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,440
There's four or five gears and so you have to go one, two, three, four, five.

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
You have to go in order.

93
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
So, we're shifting.

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
We're moving up or we're moving down.

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
So, that's called to shift.

96
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
All right, to shift.

97
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,440
And now, in the dialogue, we heard to shift into first gear.

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
So, that's what it's called.

99
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Exactly.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
And so, normally, the car starts in N, neutral.

101
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
That was when you're at a break, you're at a stop.

102
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,440
And if you want to start the car, you have to shift to first gear and that's the lowest.

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
That's going to help the car go.

104
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Okay, so to shift into first gear.

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Awesome vocabulary.

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I think this is really useful especially because it's very specific so you don't really see it very often in anywhere.

107
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
But sometimes, you need to use it.

108
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,440
That's right and it's especially useful if you're trying to teach someone.

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
How to drive.

110
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah, because not everyone knows how to drive manual.

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Exactly.

112
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,440
So, why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to explain Fluency Builder.

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Fluency Builder

114
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Okay, I'm ready for my driving lesson.

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Should I start the car?

116
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,440
Hold on there, Fittipaldi.

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
First, let's go over things one more time.

118
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Now, before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

119
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
We've been through this a million times.

121
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Let's get going already.

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm ready.

123
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Fine, start the car.

124
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Okay, now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Good.

126
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Now, accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

127
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
There we go.

128
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Good.

129
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm doing it.

130
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm driving.

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
This is awesome.

132
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Let's turn some music on.

133
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Keep your eyes on the road.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
No music.

135
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
We are coming up to a red light.

136
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Step on the brakes.

137
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
What are you doing?

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
I said the brakes.

139
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Look out for those people.

140
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Get off the sidewalk.

141
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Get out of my way.

142
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Oh, this is just like playing video games.

143
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
It's the police.

144
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Pull over.

145
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
They'll never take me alive.

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
All right, we're back.

147
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,440
So now, why don't we take a look at four key phrases in Fluency Builder.

148
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Fluency Builder.

149
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Well, the first phrase is maybe the most important when driving.

150
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
It's the first thing you do.

151
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
You start the car.

152
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
All right, so you don't say you turn on the car, right?

153
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
No.

154
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
So you put the key in the ignition and you start the car.

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
That means you turn it on.

156
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,440
What about when you want to turn off the car?

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Turn the car off.

158
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,440
You say stop the engine.

159
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Stop the car.

160
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Stop the car.

161
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Stop the engine, right?

162
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
All right, very good.

163
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Moving on, our next phrase is a million times.

164
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Why is this a phrase, a million times?

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
It's pretty literal, right?

166
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
We've been through this a million times.

167
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Well, no, it's not literal.

168
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Otherwise, I think I might kill the person.

169
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Because a million times means that we've had this same conversation many, many, many times.

170
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
But you can't actually have it a million times.

171
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
That's way too many.

172
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
So it's an exaggeration.

173
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Yeah, it's a way to say a lot.

174
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
A lot.

175
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
So I've heard him say this a million times.

176
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
I've heard this story a million times.

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Or I've done this.

178
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
I've turned the car on a million times.

179
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Okay, awesome.

180
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,440
And now, well, they were driving and they heard a police siren and the guy told her to pull over.

181
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Okay, so this is a very common car phrase again, especially when you're dealing with the police.

182
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,440
So to pull over means to slow the car down and to stop it on the side of the road.

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,440
So you could hear a policeman say, pull over.

184
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
So pull over your car.

185
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
That means slow down and stop the car on the side.

186
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Because obviously you can't stop in the middle of the road.

187
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Right.

188
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
And sometimes your mobile phone will ring as well.

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,440
And you don't have a hands-free, so you have to pull over to the side so you can pick up the phone.

190
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Usually, right?

191
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Exactly.

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Or you could say, hey, mom, could you pull over?

193
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I have to use the restroom.

194
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Exactly.

195
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Awesome.

196
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
All right.

197
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,440
And our last phrase for today is to take me alive, to take someone alive.

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
They'll never take me alive.

199
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
That's what the character says.

200
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,440
And so this is a phrase that we use when we're talking about people who are running away from the law.

201
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
So he says, they'll never capture me.

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
And if they do, I'll be dead.

203
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
So he's saying either I run free or I die.

204
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
All right.

205
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,440
So to take someone alive is basically that.

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
But is it literal?

207
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Would you say?

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
No, this is not literal.

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
He's saying, they'll never catch me.

210
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
OK.

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Very good.

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
All right.

213
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
So that's all the phrases we have for today.

214
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time.

215
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:55,440
And we'll be back.

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
OK.

217
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I'm ready for my driving lesson.

218
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Should I start the car?

219
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Hold on there, Fittipaldi.

220
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
First, let's go over things one more time.

221
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Now, before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

222
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

223
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
We've been through this a million times.

224
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Let's get going already.

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
I'm ready.

226
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Fine.

227
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Start the car.

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
OK.

229
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

230
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Good.

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

232
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
There we go.

233
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Good.

234
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm doing it.

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm driving.

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
This is awesome.

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Let's turn some music on.

238
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Keep your eyes on the road.

239
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
No music.

240
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
We are coming up to a red light.

241
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Step on the brakes.

242
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
What are you doing?

243
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
I said the brakes.

244
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Look out for those people.

245
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Get off the sidewalk.

246
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Get out of my way.

247
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Oh, this is just like playing video games.

248
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
It's the police.

249
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Pull over.

250
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
They'll never take me alive.

251
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
All right.

252
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
We're back.

253
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,440
So this is interesting because as you mentioned, a lot of people in America usually have automatic

254
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
transmissions, whereas in Europe maybe they have manual transmissions.

255
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Exactly.

256
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Is there a reason for that, do you think?

257
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm not sure what the reason would be.

258
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I think a lot of American car makers manufacture more automatic cars in general.

259
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Some people say that it's because people in America are less concerned with gas, but if

260
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,440
you have a manual transmission, you can actually conserve a bit of gas.

261
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,440
And so because gas prices in Europe are higher generally, more people are interested in having

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
manual transmissions.

263
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Also, I remember when I was younger, my dad always bought cars that had a manual transmission

264
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,440
because he said that if ever they break down, it's much easier and cheaper to fix a car

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
that has a manual transmission than it is to fix an automatic one.

266
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
That's right.

267
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Well, and I personally think that it's better to learn how to drive on a manual transmission

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,440
car because you can drive any car afterwards, but if you learn on an automatic, you'll never

269
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
know how to drive a manual.

270
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,440
There was also a case on television recently about a small child that actually the dialogue

271
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,440
is based on it, is he took his dad's car and he was like seven years old and he was driving

272
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
and was being chased by the police.

273
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
No way.

274
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,440
And then he pulled into his house and got out of the car and ran into the house.

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
So obviously he was an underage driver, but he didn't get into much trouble.

276
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
But it was interesting because he drove very, very well.

277
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
That's unbelievable.

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,440
And basically almost learned it by game simulators, by video games on how you drive on a video game.

279
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Oh, wow.

280
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Yeah, so.

281
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Well, NASCAR, here he comes.

282
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Right.

283
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,440
