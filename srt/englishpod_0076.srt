00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,280
And today we're going back to school.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
That's right.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,820
We're talking about my least favorite subject.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,060
That would be math.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
That's right.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,120
Okay, so we're going to be talking about math.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,800
Now I know that many of you, of course, know math.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Right.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,240
But do you know the operations in English?

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,960
Many people find it hard to find the right words to talk about math in English.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Right.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,260
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,400
And we'll also look at some names that you can call people who are really, really, really

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,420
smart.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,320
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:01:00,000
those math words.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All right, children, let's review.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Tommy, pay attention.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
Sorry, Miss Kadlec.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,960
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,080
What's four plus 11?

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,560
Um, 15.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,240
Miss Kadlec always asks Crystal.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,960
She's such a teacher's pet.

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Okay.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,600
And what about 56 minus 60?

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,920
Um, negative four.

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Very good.

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,320
12 times 12?

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Very good.

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Suck up.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
144.

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,000
Zero divided by one?

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
Zero.

38
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,560
How did you know that?

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
Okay, smarty pants.

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,800
The square root of two.

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,200
Bet you're not going to get that one.

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Do it all.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Um, um, 1.4142135.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:52,360
All right, so that's one smart little girl, huh?

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Yeah, pretty smart.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,080
Actually, smarter than me in math.

47
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,640
All right, so let's take a look at some of those words that the teacher used to ask her

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,360
about certain operations in Language Takeaway.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,520
Language Takeaway.

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Okay so like we said, you guys know how to do math and you know the words in your language,

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,320
but maybe in English it's a little bit harder to find the right words.

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,920
So let's look at those now.

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,160
Okay, so let's look at the first question that she asked.

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,080
What's four plus 11?

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Four plus 11.

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,800
Okay, plus.

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Plus.

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
All right.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
So four plus 11, Erica, is?

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
Uh, let me take a look at here.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
Um, 15.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
15.

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,480
Okay, so we are adding, right?

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Yes.

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
So that's how you would say.

66
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Let's go with an easy one.

67
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Two plus two.

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Four.

69
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
Four, right?

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,960
Or five plus five.

71
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Ten.

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
Ten, okay.

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,680
You're really testing my skills.

74
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,620
So that's how you would add numbers.

75
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,120
Now what about taking away numbers?

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
Okay, so taking away or subtracting.

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,560
All right, let's test you again.

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,920
In the dialogue, she said 56 minus 60.

79
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,640
56 minus 60 equals negative four.

80
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
Okay, minus.

81
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
So that's negative, right?

82
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Minus.

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
So, and of course, if you have 56 apples and you take away 60, you are left with?

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Negative four.

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Negative four.

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,040
Well, actually, you're left with zero apples.

87
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Yeah, exactly.

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,480
Now, that answer is also interesting, negative four.

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Negative four.

90
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,560
That means minus four, right?

91
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
Four less than zero.

92
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Four less than zero.

93
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Very good.

94
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Negative four.

95
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,600
Okay, so now for our next operation.

96
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,560
Twelve times twelve.

97
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Twelve times twelve.

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Twelve times twelve.

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,320
Now, Marco, don't ask me the answer.

100
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,360
All right, twelve times twelve equals 144.

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Now that's multiplying.

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Right, or multiplication.

103
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Multiplication.

104
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Yeah, multiplication.

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,240
Okay, so this times part, it's very easy to remember because, for example, four times

106
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
four.

107
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,000
You can just say four, the number four, and you add it, right?

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Four times.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Four times.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Four plus four plus four plus four.

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Right, so times.

112
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Times.

113
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Uh-huh.

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,400
Now, the opposite of times.

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,160
All right, the opposite of multiplication is division.

116
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Division.

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,200
Okay, so in our dialogue, the teacher said zero divided by one.

118
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,040
Zero divided by one.

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
Zero divided by one.

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Any number divided by zero is zero.

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
All right, so let's give another example.

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Fifteen divided by three.

123
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,400
All right, so fifteen divided by three equals?

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Five.

125
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,720
Five, exactly.

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,480
So divided by.

127
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,720
Divided by.

128
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Very good.

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,040
So after division, the teacher was very impressed, and now she asked a very hard mathematical

130
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,320
operation, especially for a girl this age.

131
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,400
The square root of two.

132
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,520
The square root of.

133
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,820
Square root.

134
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,960
So let's give some examples to show what is the square root.

135
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Okay, so if I ask you the square root of nine.

136
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Three.

137
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Three, right?

138
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Yes.

139
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,680
What about the square root of four?

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Two.

141
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,440
Two, okay.

142
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,720
So now one more.

143
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,400
The square root of sixteen.

144
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Four.

145
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Four.

146
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,840
Okay, so you noticed the pattern, right?

147
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,000
And I'm sure everyone knows this in their own language, how you would get a square root.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Exactly.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,480
So, this language is pretty simple.

150
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,000
You all know it in your own language, but let's hear it again in English one more time

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
with the dialogue.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Alright, children, let's review.

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
Tommy, pay attention.

154
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Sorry, Miss Kadlec.

155
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,920
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

156
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,440
What's four plus eleven?

157
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,160
Um, fifteen.

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,200
Miss Kadlec always asks Crystal.

159
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,880
She's such a teacher's pet.

160
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, and what about fifty-six minus sixty?

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,560
Um, negative four.

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Very good.

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
Twelve times twelve?

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Very good, suck up.

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
One forty-four.

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,960
Zero divided by one?

167
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,040
Zero.

168
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,840
How did you know that?

169
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,720
Okay smarty pants, the square root of two.

170
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,080
Bet you're not going to get that one, do it all.

171
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,680
Um, um, one point four, one four, two one three five.

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, so we understand the mathematical operations that we saw here, very easy.

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
But now there was another little kid in there who was very, I think, envious or jealous.

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Yeah, Tommy.

175
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,120
Tommy, right?

176
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,360
So he called her a couple of different names.

177
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,880
Well let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

178
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Fluency Builder.

179
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,200
Okay, so the first one that he called Crystal, the little girl, he called her a teacher's

180
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,360
pet.

181
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,480
Teacher's pet.

182
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Teacher's pet.

183
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Teacher's pet.

184
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,800
So Erica, what exactly is a teacher's pet?

185
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,840
It is the favorite student the teacher has in that class.

186
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,600
Alright, so it's always the student that's helping the teacher.

187
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Yeah, the smartest student.

188
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
The teacher's pet.

190
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah, and it has a negative meaning in English.

191
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,320
Yeah, I wouldn't say that it's a good thing to be the teacher's pet.

192
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,760
Like the teacher thinks it's good.

193
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Yeah.

194
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,040
But all of the friends and the classmates, they think it's bad.

195
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
Yeah, exactly.

196
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Teacher's pet.

197
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,240
And similar to teacher's pet is a suck up.

198
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Suck up.

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Suck up.

200
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Again, suck up.

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
What is a suck up?

202
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,800
A suck up is a person who tries really, really hard to make the teacher like him.

203
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,560
Okay, now we can also use it outside of the classroom, right?

204
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah, at work maybe.

205
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,880
Okay, there is always at work, there is always one person who's the suck up, right?

206
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Yes.

207
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,320
Now again, this has a negative meaning in English.

208
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,480
Yeah, I guess in the workplace, the rest of your colleagues don't really like that person

209
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,280
who's considered to be the suck up, who's always trying to please the boss.

210
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Exactly.

211
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
All right.

212
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,280
All right, so the teacher calls Crystal a smarty pants.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
Smarty pants.

214
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Smarty pants.

215
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,220
Okay, so this is also a little name calling, right?

216
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,920
So what is a smarty pants?

217
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,520
Somebody who is too smart.

218
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Too smart.

219
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,080
Who tries too hard to be smart.

220
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
Now this is only for little kids, right?

221
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,280
I wouldn't call you a smarty pants, right?

222
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,360
No, it's definitely for children.

223
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Adults don't say this.

224
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,280
Unless maybe you are joking or having fun with someone.

225
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,640
Yeah, but if you say it, you are suggesting that you're being like a child.

226
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Right.

227
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,520
Okay, smarty pants.

228
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,400
And our last one, and this is also a very good phrase and a way to describe someone,

229
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
know it all.

230
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,480
Know it all.

231
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Know it all.

232
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
A know it all.

233
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
Sometimes you say Mr. Know it all, right?

234
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
Okay, so what is a know it all?

236
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,120
Somebody who tries to show everyone that they know it all.

237
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
They know everything.

238
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Yeah, they're so smart.

239
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,520
They have the answers to everything.

240
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,720
But they really, really try and show everyone that they know everything.

241
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
These people can be sometimes a little bit irritating, right?

242
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah, very, very annoying.

243
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Annoying.

244
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Yeah.

245
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,080
All right, so it's not a good thing to be a know it all all the time.

246
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Yeah, actually all of these phrases are not good things to be.

247
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,680
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue one more time and then we're going to come back

248
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:54,400
and Erica's going to tell us how much she hates math.

249
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,440
All right children, let's review.

250
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Tommy, pay attention.

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,800
Sorry, Miss Catlett.

252
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,360
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

253
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,640
What's four plus eleven?

254
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Fifteen.

255
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,600
Miss Catlett always asks Crystal.

256
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,280
She's such a teacher's pet.

257
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,040
Okay, and what about 56 minus 60?

258
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240
Negative four.

259
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Very good.

260
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
Twelve times twelve?

261
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Very good, suck up.

262
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
144.

263
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,280
Zero divided by one?

264
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,440
Zero.

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,920
How did you know that?

266
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,560
Okay, smarty pants.

267
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
The square root of two.

268
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Bet you're not going to get that one, know it all.

269
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
1.4142135.

270
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:46,720
All right, so Erica, you were telling me that you hated math or you still do.

271
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Well, yes, that's true.

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,960
I really do hate math and even doing a simple, you know, like 16 plus 32 is too hard for

273
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
me.

274
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,040
So you were never really that type of person that's good with numbers.

275
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
No, I'm terrible with numbers.

276
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
I can't even remember my own phone number.

277
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Really?

278
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Yeah.

279
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,080
Like I really, if someone asks me for my phone number, I have to look on my phone in the

280
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,640
address book to find it.

281
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Well, yeah, sometimes numbers can be difficult.

282
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,880
I kind of liked math when I was younger.

283
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,120
It just made sense.

284
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,760
Well, I guess there's a reason why I'm an English teacher and not a math teacher.

285
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
And I was actually not very good at language.

286
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
But here you are.

287
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Exactly.

288
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
Well, I mean, in Spanish, I like grammar.

289
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,640
Not very good at that, all those rules.

290
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,080
Yeah, but you're pretty good at English.

291
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh, that's all right.

292
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
That's all right.

293
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Yeah.

294
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
What about you guys?

295
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,120
Tell us what your favorite subject or your least favorite subject in school was.

296
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
What about you?

297
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,880
Do you have any favorite subject or did you have a favorite subject?

298
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
History.

299
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
History.

300
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Yeah.

301
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Yeah.

302
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Okay.

303
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I liked chemistry for a while.

304
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh, God.

305
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Chemistry involves numbers.

306
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Well, a little bit, but it was interesting as well.

307
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,840
So come to the website, everyone, EnglishPod.com and you can find lots of other resources there.

So you can choose if you're an elementary student, then you would be talking to other

311
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,040
elementaries.

312
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
That's right.

313
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:33,160
