00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,200
My name is Kathryn and we're talking today about health and getting sick.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
That's right.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,180
We are going to visit the doctor so we're feeling a little bit ill and well, we're going

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,840
to describe some of the symptoms that we have and the doctor is going to recommend some

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
medicine.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
All right.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,520
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
what's going on.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:35,400
Good afternoon, Chloe.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,520
I'm Dr. Evans.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,840
What seems to be the problem?

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,600
Hi, Dr. Evans.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,440
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,640
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,600
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
I see.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,960
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Would you please open your mouth and say, ah?

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Ah.

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Good.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Yes.

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,880
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,000
How are your ears?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Blocked at all?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
A little, actually.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,080
I really feel terrible.

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,400
Okay, Chloe.

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,320
Can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,100
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,680
You don't sound too good at all.

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Okay.

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,820
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,680
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,740
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,000
up your lungs.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,080
Whoa, so many drugs.

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,280
I hate swallowing pills.

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,920
Am I able to go to work?

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,240
Absolutely not.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,080
You are highly contagious.

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,000
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,120
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,200
don't get weak and dehydrated.

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,840
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Okay.

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,760
Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,920
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,280
Sure, no problem.

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Here you are.

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Now, off home and away to bed.

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,880
Feel better soon and take care.

58
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,080
Thanks, Doc.

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Bye.

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Bye.

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,040
All right, we're back.

62
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,560
So now let's take a look at six key words that we have prepared for you today on Language

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
Takeaway.

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,580
Language Takeaway.

65
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,220
So oftentimes in the wintertime when the air is very, very dry and maybe you have a cold,

66
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,220
you get this.

67
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,400
This is the first thing we're talking about.

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
That's right.

69
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
We have a sore throat.

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Okay, so Chloe in the dialogue says, I woke up this morning and I had a really sore throat.

71
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Right.

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
So let's take a look at those two words.

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,520
We know throat is the part of your neck, right?

74
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Right.

75
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Connects your head to your body.

76
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
That's right.

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,840
And the word sore.

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,060
Sore means it hurts.

79
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,600
So I could have a sore back or sore knees.

80
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,720
Sore is basically an adjective that describes pain.

81
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Pain.

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
So you have an ache in your throat.

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
All right.

84
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,360
Chloe has a sore throat.

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,520
And well, she said that she has this sore throat and the doctor says, I see.

86
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,080
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

87
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Okay.

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,000
Croaky is a way to describe the way a person sounds, especially when they're talking and

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,560
maybe their voice I think is very deep or rough.

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Right.

91
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,720
So usually if you have a sore throat or a very bad cough, you sound a little bit croaky.

92
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,520
So you're like, hey, my throat hurts a little bit.

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Exactly.

94
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
Not a very nice way to sound.

95
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,560
It comes from the way that frogs croak, right?

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Yeah.

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,600
That's the sound that frogs make.

98
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,640
They croak.

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,120
So yeah, sometimes when you do have a sore throat or a very bad cough, people say that

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
you have a frog in your throat.

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Right.

102
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
All right.

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,440
So that's the word croaky.

104
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Now moving on, if you have a sore throat, it's usually because your tonsils are swollen.

105
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Okay.

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,400
So the first word here, tonsils, these are a body part.

107
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,280
They're in your throat, the very back of your throat, and you usually have two of them.

108
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,520
Some people don't have any though.

109
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Right.

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Some people get them removed.

111
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,320
They're like little balls in the back of your throat.

112
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,360
And I don't really know what they do.

113
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,840
I think they pick up some, I don't know what they do.

114
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,400
I don't think you need them actually, because a lot of people have them taken out when they're

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
young.

116
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,920
But tonsils when they are infected or when they are swollen are very, very painful.

117
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,640
You can have really bad sore throats.

118
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Right.

119
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,440
And it can cause fevers and stuff like that.

120
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,600
So some people get them removed.

121
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,640
And well, as we said, your tonsils are swollen.

122
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,160
So if they are swollen, that means they are big.

123
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
That's right.

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,000
So swollen means they're bigger than normal.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,880
And you can say this about many different things.

126
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,720
For example, maybe someone stepped on my toe and my toe really hurts and I looked down

127
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,040
and it's swollen.

128
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,360
That means my toe got bigger.

129
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Okay.

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,920
So this is an adjective when something is swollen.

131
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,400
But the verb form to say that something swells.

132
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
It gets bigger.

133
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
It gets bigger to swell.

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,920
Or the adjective, it is swollen.

135
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
All right.

136
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,160
And now she was talking a little bit about her sinuses.

137
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,620
Her sinuses are a little blocked up.

138
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,600
So sinuses are in your face.

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,140
You have them in your nose and under your eyes.

140
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,500
And when they hurt, it's actually quite painful.

141
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,500
And people say that sometimes their sinuses are aggravated or they have bad sinuses.

142
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,240
This means they're having a hard time breathing or their face is sore, their eyes are sore.

143
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
It's very common.

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay.

145
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
So that's sinuses.

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,720
Isn't there actually a condition that if you have blocked sinuses all the time, they call

147
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
it sinusitis.

148
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Sinusitis.

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah.

150
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,800
So that's a problem that comes back again and again.

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Okay.

152
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,560
And the doctor also recommended her to rest because she is highly contagious.

153
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Okay.

154
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,880
So you want to stay away from people who are contagious.

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,280
This means that what disease they have or what illness they have can affect other people.

156
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,520
So if I have the flu, Marco, and I come to work, it's pretty contagious.

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,800
It's very likely that you will get the flu.

158
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
That's right.

159
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,480
So a flu is very highly contagious or many other things are highly contagious.

160
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,000
For example, pink eye is very contagious.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,760
But you know, cancer is not contagious.

162
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,080
If you have cancer, I can't get it from touching you.

163
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Right.

164
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Very good.

165
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
So contagious.

166
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
All right.

167
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,600
Why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit to

168
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,560
talk about Fluency Builder.

169
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Good afternoon, Chloe.

170
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I'm Dr. Evans.

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,880
What seems to be the problem?

172
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,600
Hi, Dr. Evans.

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,440
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

174
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,640
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

175
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,560
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

176
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,760
I see.

177
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,960
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

178
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,160
Could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

180
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Ah.

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Good.

182
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Yes.

183
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
How are your ears?

185
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,160
Blocked at all?

186
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,200
A little, actually.

187
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,320
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

188
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,120
I really feel terrible.

189
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
OK, Chloe.

190
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
Can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,080
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

192
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,640
You don't sound too good at all.

193
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,080
OK, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

194
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,800
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,760
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear

197
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
up your lungs.

198
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,360
Whoa, so many drugs.

199
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,320
Ah, I hate swallowing pills.

200
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,000
Am I able to go to work?

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
Absolutely not.

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
You are highly contagious.

203
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
don't get weak and dehydrated.

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,880
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

207
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
OK.

208
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,760
Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

209
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,920
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

210
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,320
Sure, no problem.

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Here you are.

212
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,560
Now, off home and away to bed.

213
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,040
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

214
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,240
Feel better soon and take care.

215
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Thanks doc.

216
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Bye.

217
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Bye.

218
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,240
All right, we're back.

219
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,600
So now let's take a look at four key phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

220
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,320
So, Chloe goes in to see her doctor, Dr. Evans, and she says, thanks for seeing me on such

221
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,760
short notice.

222
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
What's short notice?

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
All right.

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,680
So basically, Chloe made an appointment with the doctor very late or very suddenly.

225
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,000
So that's a short notice.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Great.

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,680
So, for example, it's Friday night and she needs to make an appointment for Saturday

228
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,800
morning.

229
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,960
That's pretty short notice.

230
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,320
That's not calling the doctor in advance.

231
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,880
You can say this also when you're talking to friends.

232
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,800
You know, I'm really sorry to cancel on such short notice, but I can't go to dinner tonight.

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Right.

234
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,600
So I think it's very interesting, the whole structure as you see on such short notice.

235
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,040
So as you said, your example, I'm really sorry to cancel on such short notice.

236
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,320
On short notice.

237
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,800
On such short notice.

238
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
That's right.

239
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
All right.

240
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,040
So moving on to our second phrase, Chloe was explaining that she doesn't feel very well

241
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,040
and she said, I think I'm coming down with the flu.

242
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Okay.

243
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,400
So let's look at this verbal phrase here, coming down with.

244
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Okay.

245
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,360
So you can come down with many different illnesses, but the verb here means, this is the beginning

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,680
of my illness.

247
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,800
So I'm starting to feel the effects.

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,320
Like you said, Marco, I'm feeling some symptoms.

249
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,000
So I'm starting to get sick, right?

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm coming down with a fever.

251
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,920
Or I think I'm coming down with a cold.

252
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,480
Very common.

253
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,520
All right.

254
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,880
And the doctor started to check Chloe, how she was breathing.

255
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,200
And I think he listened to her lungs with his, what is it called?

256
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
A stethoscope.

257
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Stethoscope.

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Stethoscope.

259
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,240
And he said, wow, you are really all bunged up.

260
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
All right.

261
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,960
So here he's basically saying that she's very congested.

262
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,560
That means that her breathing passageways, like in her nose and her throat and her chest,

263
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,360
are very stuffy.

264
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,920
There's things in them.

265
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Usually mucus.

266
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Yeah, phlegm.

267
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Phlegm.

268
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,640
These are things that, you know what's in your nose when you have a cold and you have

269
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,880
to blow it out?

270
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,360
That's phlegm and mucus.

271
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah.

272
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Not a very pretty thing.

273
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
No.

274
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Very disgusting, actually.

275
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
So maybe we should move on to our next item.

276
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
All right.

277
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,040
So she's all bunged up.

278
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
And clear up.

279
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,360
And so he recommended a couple of different medicine, such as antibiotics, some pills,

280
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,600
and he also gave her an inhaler to clear up her lungs.

281
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Okay.

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,520
So an inhaler is basically a device that you use to put steroids in your lungs that will

283
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,640
help you breathe.

284
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,120
So some people, when they're running or they're walking, they're very short of breath and

285
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
they can't breathe.

286
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,760
Well, there's a problem with this, like asthma, and they need to breathe this little inhaler.

287
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,520
It's like a little tube.

288
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,560
I think you inhale medicine from this little tube.

289
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Yeah.

290
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,160
So the medicine helps open up your passageways.

291
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,960
It helps you breathe and it's very important for some people.

292
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,360
But in the case of an illness, like your lungs are very congested, this helps you breathe

293
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
on the short term.

294
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Right.

295
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,600
So to clear up is to allow air or the movement of something within your body, usually, I

296
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
think.

297
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Right.

298
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
But to clear up isn't necessarily about air.

299
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,160
It's basically a way to say that it will make this problem go away.

300
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,160
To clear something up is to make the problem go.

301
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Right.

302
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,080
So I guess if you get medicine from a doctor, he'll say, okay, this will help you clear

303
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,920
up your throat.

304
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Right.

305
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,400
Or if you have a problem with acne, maybe your doctor will give you some cream to help

306
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,000
clear up your acne, make it go away.

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Clear up your skin.

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

309
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,520
So a lot of great examples there.

310
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:55,160
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.

311
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Good afternoon, Chloe.

312
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm Dr. Evans.

313
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,520
What seems to be the problem?

314
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,200
Hi, Dr. Evans.

315
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

316
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,240
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

317
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,200
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

318
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
I see.

319
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

320
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,600
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

321
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,920
Could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

322
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Ah.

323
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Good.

324
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes.

325
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,440
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

326
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
How are your ears?

327
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Blocked at all?

328
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,800
A little, actually.

329
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

330
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
I really feel terrible.

331
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,980
Okay, Chloe.

332
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,880
Can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

333
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

334
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,240
You don't sound too good at all.

335
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,680
Okay, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

336
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,400
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

337
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,320
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

338
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear

339
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,560
up your lungs.

340
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,000
Whoa, so many drugs.

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,880
Ah, I hate swallowing pills.

342
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,560
Am I able to go to work?

343
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,840
Absolutely not.

344
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,680
You are highly contagious.

345
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,600
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

346
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,720
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you

347
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
don't get weak and dehydrated.

348
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,520
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

349
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Okay.

350
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,320
Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

351
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,560
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

352
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
Sure, no problem.

353
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Here you are.

354
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,120
Now, off home and away to bed.

355
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,600
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

356
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
Feel better soon and take care.

357
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Thanks doc.

358
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Bye.

359
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Bye.

360
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:56,520
All right, so talking about illnesses and being contagious, we mentioned this pink eye

361
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
illness before.

362
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,000
So this is the colloquial way of saying conjunctivitis, which is, I don't know if anyone has ever

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,360
gotten it, your eye gets very, very red for a prolonged period of time.

364
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
That's right.

365
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
And it itches a lot.

366
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
It itches.

367
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
And so already your eye is very red or very pink, like the name says, but you really want

368
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,800
to scratch it and itch it and it's really hard not to.

369
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Yeah.

370
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,680
And I think you treat it by means of some eye drops.

371
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Yeah.

372
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
And you have to wait.

373
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,560
I actually had a very bad case of pink eye once that I couldn't just clear up with drops.

374
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,680
The doctor gave me some eye drops.

375
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,800
They were so strong that I put them in my eye and I can taste them.

376
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Oh, wow.

377
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Yeah.

378
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,740
So apparently, yeah, it's very strange and it wouldn't clear up.

379
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,320
So then I had to get some kind of like a clear gel put in my eye and my eye patched up for

380
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
like two days.

381
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh wow.

382
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Yeah.

383
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
So I was running around with one eye.

384
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
It was crazy.

385
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,680
I've never had it, but I know that it's very, very contagious, like we were saying earlier.

386
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,680
And so if a student at a school gets pink eye, all the parents get very nervous because

387
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,360
it's very, very likely that he or she will give it to another person.

388
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Yeah.

389
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,880
Because, you know, kids, if you touch your eye and you touch someone else, all of a sudden

390
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,320
they have this disease.

391
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Exactly.

392
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,440
So, yeah, it's very common thing.

393
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,680
And I think with especially with kids, they always get all these things, pink eye, measles.

394
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
They get chickenpox.

395
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Chickenpox.

396
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,320
A lot of different diseases.

397
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,800
We actually have a lesson on chickenpox.

398
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,200
