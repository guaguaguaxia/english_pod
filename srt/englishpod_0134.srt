00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,560
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,040
Katarina And my name is Katarina.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,840
So Marco, you've been shopping a lot lately.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,560
Marco I have.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,880
And this dialogue or this lesson today is one of my favorite pieces of furniture, maybe

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,400
appliances that I've bought recently, and it's a TV.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Katarina All right.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,040
So I'd even go for electronics with that one.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,760
The electronics department is somewhere you like to hang out.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Marco Uh-huh.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,240
I mean, I think every guy loves, you know, like a big screen TV and a home theater system.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,520
So you just like go deaf after watching.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Katarina Why is that?

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,080
Is bigger really better when it comes to like a 70 inch TV?

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,760
Marco Well, I don't know.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,680
I think, yeah, the whole experience of just seeing this movie on this huge TV and like

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,600
having all the sound and I don't know, it's just something about that or watching a football

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
game with your buddies and you can actually watch.

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Katarina Oh, fun.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Okay, that I can appreciate.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,320
But we've got a couple of great words for you.

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,960
We're going to preview in today's vocabulary preview.

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Vocabulary Preview.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,840
Marco Okay, so on vocabulary preview today, we're

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
going to be looking at two words.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,200
The first one is to appreciate.

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,520
Katarina All right.

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,240
So this basically means to like.

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,360
Marco Yeah, you appreciate someone.

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,120
But in this context, to enjoy or take advantage of something.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
So...

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,520
Katarina Maybe you hear this with a couple, two people

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,000
who are fighting and the girl says to the guy, you don't appreciate me.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,400
So he doesn't really care about her in the way that she wants him to.

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,160
Or you could say this about a TV, for example, I can't appreciate my PS3, my great, awesome

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,240
console, my gaming system, because my TV is not good enough.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Marco Or big enough.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Katarina Or big enough.

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Or big enough.

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,320
So this means that it could be a lot better if I just bought a better TV.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,400
Marco Right.

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,080
And if you buy a better TV, then you basically are upgrading or to upgrade.

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,640
Katarina Okay, so this verb to upgrade means to go

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
from something that's okay to something that's better.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
Marco Exactly.

48
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,080
So in previous lessons, we've seen to get a complimentary upgrade, for example, on a

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,440
flight or in a hotel.

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,560
Katarina I like that.

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,120
Well, you can also get an upgrade on a computer.

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
You say, well, my computer's from 1994.

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
I really need to get an upgrade.

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,840
Marco Yeah, for sure.

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
So to upgrade.

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,160
Now, we're going to be listening to this dialogue for the first time, we're going to be buying

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
a TV.

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
So let's listen.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:34,800
Katarina Seriously, I don't know why we need to get

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
a new TV.

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Marco Honey, I told you already.

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,120
I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
our old TV.

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Good afternoon, folks, how can I be of service today?

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,240
You've come to the right place.

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,400
What size are you looking for?

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,880
Just a normal size TV for a living room.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
I see.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,320
Well, this set here is on sale.

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,040
It's a 46 inch HT TV screen and it has all the works three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
and S video ports.

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,720
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,520
This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience.

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,680
This is exactly what I need.

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,320
Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,200
Katarina Honey, I think it's a bit too big.

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,760
I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

79
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,800
Not to worry.

80
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,640
We will deliver and install it in your home.

81
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,880
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

82
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,600
This is great.

83
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,320
How much will this set me back?

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,840
Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock, so it's half off.

85
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I'll take it.

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,280
All right, so I'm going to have to defer to you, Marco, on some of these words in today's

87
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,920
language takeaway because they're all about TV specifics.

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Language takeaway.

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,200
All right, the first word that we're going to be looking at is graphics, the graphics

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
level.

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,320
All right, so you might have heard this before with the phrase graphic designer, someone

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
who designs images.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,480
But in this case, we're talking about graphics, so the way things appear on your TV.

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,360
So basically the pictures, right?

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,360
So he wanted to appreciate the graphics of his PlayStation 3 better, and that's why he

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
wanted a new TV.

97
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,640
All right, or he could say, my computer has amazing graphics.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,760
It means games are really fun because they look good.

99
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,960
Or this game has amazing graphics, so the game has places or scenery that looks really,

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
really real.

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
All right, so graphics.

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,600
But some kinds of TVs are made to provide those wonderful graphics, and those are called

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
HDTV.

104
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Right, and HDTV, or that's an acronym for high definition television.

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,400
All right, and I heard some actors and actresses were complaining about HDTV because the picture

106
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,400
quality is so good that you can see all of the little problems on their face, the little

107
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,960
wrinkles and the pimples and the scars.

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,560
So be careful because one day we're going to be able to see way too much.

109
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,640
Exactly.

110
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,560
So on high definition television, that's basically what you get is better definition, better level

111
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
of graphics.

112
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,920
So more pixels per inch, you can see a lot more clarity.

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,840
Right, so an HDTV.

114
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
The next thing we're talking about is actually kind of related to the back part of your TV

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,800
where you plug things in.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,840
Sometimes it's on the side, sometimes it's on the back.

117
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
Well, there are different names for different kinds of plugs.

118
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,280
So today we're going to talk about two of those.

119
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,680
One of them is USB.

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,760
Right, this TV has a USB port, which basically stands for universal serial bus.

121
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,160
All right, so a port is a place where you plug something in.

122
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
Your computer has a lot of ports as well.

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,240
But USB is maybe more common for people who have iPods or computers because this is how

124
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,320
we normally connect things to our computers.

125
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,000
So in this case, this television, you could connect maybe your iPod and reproduce videos

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
or pictures onto the TV.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Awesome.

128
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,400
Or in the second case, we have a DVI port.

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,080
So DVI, you're going to have to tell me about this one, Marco, because I'm not so sure.

130
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Well, a DVI is basically a digital video input.

131
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,080
So basically you can connect your computer to the TV and see what's on your screen.

132
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Nice.

133
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,400
And so if you have a bunch of movies stored on your computer, you can just plug it into

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,640
the TV and watch.

135
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,440
Or you can even navigate the internet on a big screen TV.

136
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Cool.

137
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
All right.

138
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
So what are these three HDMI connectors?

139
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
All right.

140
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,680
Well, this is a new technology.

141
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,880
Basically, you know how before you used to get your DVD player, your VHS, and you had

142
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,200
three cables, two for sound and one for video?

143
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,480
Yeah, the red, yellow, and white cables.

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Exactly.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,960
So with this new type of cable or technology, with one cable, it takes all the information

146
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
to the TV.

147
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
So just one cable for everything.

148
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Oh, nice.

149
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,160
The problem is I always used to put the wrong cable in the wrong port, so I'd have the red

150
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,080
cable in the yellow port, and then I'd say, where's the video?

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I can't see.

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,720
All I can do is listen.

153
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Yeah, it happens.

154
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
So with this, now it's easy.

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,640
And well, it's a little bit more organized, because I remember I used to have a TV and

156
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,200
I had a lot of different things connected to it.

157
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,840
It was just this big spider web in the back with all these cables.

158
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,560
So an HDMI, high definition multimedia interface connector.

159
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,720
And what else do we have?

160
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,520
Well, the last thing we're talking about is actually the place to put your TV.

161
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,920
So a lot of people now are putting their TVs on walls like paintings, because these TVs

162
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
are so thin.

163
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,320
So we call this a wall mount.

164
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,520
So a mount, to mount something is also a verb, right?

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
Yeah, it means to put something up or to hang something up.

166
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,660
So many people like to mount their trophies to show off.

167
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
Very good.

168
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,320
So this is what we're doing with the TV.

169
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,360
We're going to mount it on the wall like a painting.

170
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Cool.

171
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
So those are our words for language takeaway.

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,360
We're going to slow it down this time and really figure out what's going on.

174
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,800
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

175
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
Honey, I told you already.

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,760
I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on

177
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
our old TV.

178
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,160
Good afternoon, folks.

179
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,440
How can I be of service today?

180
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

181
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,520
You've come to the right place.

182
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,680
What size are you looking for?

183
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Just a normal sized TV for a living room.

184
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
I see.

185
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Well, this set here is on sale.

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,680
It's a 46 inch HTTV screen and it has all the works.

187
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA, and S-video ports.

188
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,000
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,800
This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience.

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,960
This is exactly what I need.

191
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

192
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Honey, I think it's a bit too big.

193
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,080
I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,120
Not to worry.

195
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
We will deliver and install it in your home.

196
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,200
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,920
This is great.

198
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,760
How much will this set me back?

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,280
Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half off.

200
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,480
I'll take it.

201
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
All right.

202
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,360
So now we're going to be taking a look at three different phrases that we saw in this

203
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,960
dialogue in Fluency Builder.

204
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Fluency Builder.

205
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
All right.

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,960
This first phrase is definitely one that I use a lot.

207
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
We can talk about food.

208
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
We can talk about electronics.

209
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,880
We can talk about most different things.

210
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,600
But the phrase here is the works.

211
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,920
He's getting the works.

212
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
All right.

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,680
That means any option he could get, any possibility, he wants it all.

214
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Right.

215
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
So if you're getting a new car, for example, right, you're getting the high definition

216
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
sound system.

217
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,240
You're getting nice tires, leather seats.

218
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
You're getting the works.

219
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
All right.

220
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Or if you're getting a hamburger and you want the works, you're getting it with cheese and

221
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,280
lettuce and tomato and pepper and bacon and you know, it means every option you're getting

222
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
it all.

223
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
The works.

224
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,960
So I think this word is so versatile that we should maybe listen to some more examples.

225
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,400
Example one.

226
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,560
The bridegroom was wearing a morning suit, top hat, gloves, the works.

227
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,760
Example two.

228
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,640
He spent over $10,000 on his home theater system.

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,480
He got all the works.

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,800
Example three.

231
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,580
I bought a new car with all the works, magnesium rims, custom paint and leather seats.

232
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,760
So now that we've seen the works on the home theater system, he needs to hook it up.

233
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
All right.

234
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,040
So this is an important part and a very exciting part of a new purchase.

235
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,200
So when you buy something, you have to hook it up.

236
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,520
That means you have to plug things together.

237
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay.

238
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,520
So we plug things into the wall for electricity, but also hook up maybe those, those cores

239
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,000
you were talking about earlier, that HDMI connector, that's called hooking up or connecting.

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,080
So you would hook up your DVD player to your television.

241
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
All right.

242
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,560
I could ask you, did you hook up those new speakers to your big TV yesterday?

243
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Very good.

244
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Right.

245
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
So to connect, it's another way of saying to connect.

246
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,800
And finally, the, the big event when you're buying something is the end when you have

247
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,040
to actually pay.

248
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,100
And this guy's a little bit worried that the things he wants cost a lot of money.

249
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,800
So he asks a really great question.

250
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Yeah.

251
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,840
He said, how much will this set me back?

252
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Okay.

253
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,600
This sounds a little weird at first, because you could just say, how much will this cost?

254
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,840
But he's speaking in a very colloquial way, very familiar.

255
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,080
And he says, how much will this set me back?

256
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Right.

257
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,840
So how much will this cost me?

258
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,600
So how much am I actually going to spend?

259
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,760
So it's just a different way of saying how much does it cost?

260
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
But it's like you say, more colloquial.

261
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
It's a lot more native-like.

262
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Exactly.

263
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,560
And so if you're writing your paper, you don't want to write this, this will set you back

264
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
$500 in economics.

265
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,560
But we'd say this in spoken language in our normal daily lives with friends.

266
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,320
So why don't we listen to a couple more examples of set me back.

267
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,240
Example one.

268
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,360
This unexpected expense is going to set us back a couple thousand dollars.

269
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,720
Example two.

270
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,200
That fancy dinner at the restaurant last night really set us back.

271
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,760
Example three.

272
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
I feel guilty about buying this coat.

273
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,400
It set me back over $300.

274
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
All right.

275
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Great.

276
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,520
So now that we've taken a look at those great phrases and with some good examples, why don't

277
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,400
we listen to this dialogue one last time.

278
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:30,520
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

279
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,960
Honey, I told you already.

280
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,480
I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on

281
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,680
our old TV.

282
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,180
Good afternoon, folks.

283
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,480
How can I be of service today?

284
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

285
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,560
You've come to the right place.

286
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,720
What size are you looking for?

287
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,200
Just a normal size TV for a living room.

288
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,480
I see.

289
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,640
Well, this set here is on sale.

290
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,720
It's a 46 inch HT TV screen and it has all the works.

291
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,340
Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S video ports.

292
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,040
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

293
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,840
This is without a doubt, the complete home theater experience.

294
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,000
This is exactly what I need.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

296
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,520
Honey, I think it's a bit too big.

297
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,120
I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

298
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,160
Not to worry.

299
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,000
We will deliver and install it in your home.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,240
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

301
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,960
This is great.

302
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,680
How much will this set me back?

303
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,200
Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half off.

304
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,360
I'll take it.

305
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:59,720
Okay, so a big TV, I think, I don't know, I think it's just a great thing to have at

306
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
home.

307
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,660
Not to, you know, spend too much time in front of the TV but it's good to sit down and watch

308
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
a movie.

309
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,400
It's nice because now there's so many different things you can do with it.

310
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,960
You can hook up your computer, you can buy a projector, you can play your PS3 or your

311
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,500
Wii.

312
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,240
So I think there's a lot to do and it's just wonderful how great graphics have come in

313
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,320
just like the last five years.

314
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,520
What do you think about having a television set, for example, in the bathroom?

315
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,000
I would say it's a really bad idea but I think, well, if I have a bathtub, I think it would

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
be really cool.

317
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
What about, you know, some people don't like having a television set in their bedroom.

318
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
I agree with this.

319
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Why?

320
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
I agree.

321
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,520
Because I think it's really important that you have peace and quiet in your bedroom because

322
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,000
it's kind of like, for me, it's an important space where I can just relax and be quiet

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,200
and I like reading a lot so if I have a TV, maybe I'll watch more TV but I'd much rather

324
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,760
read a book before bed.

325
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
True.

326
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,640
Yeah, I definitely agree but, you know, I've seen people that have TVs in their living

327
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,120
rooms, in their dining rooms, even in their kitchen so they're watching something while

328
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,600
they're cooking and even in the bathroom.

329
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,320
Like you say, in a bathtub, well, it's nice but some of them I've seen in front of the

330
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
toilet or something.

331
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Oh, no.

332
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,360
I would say that the one in the kitchen is nice because if you spend a lot of time in

333
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,400
the kitchen, you can watch the news while you're cooking or you can actually watch

334
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,800
cooking shows and try and practice.

335
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Or soap operas.

336
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Or soap operas.

337
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,320
So I guess it depends on the person.

338
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,400
It depends on how much you watch TV.

339
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,680
But I'm curious to know what our listeners have to say about TVs and big electronics

340
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
purchases.

341
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
Right.

342
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,400
So come to our website EnglishPod.com.

343
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,720
If you have any questions or any doubts regarding the lesson or any suggestions, you can let

344
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
us know.

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,080
Otherwise, we'll be there to just talk and practice that English and of course send us

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
your suggestions for future lessons.

347
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,480
We love to know what you're interested in learning about.

348
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
All right.

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
We'll see you guys there.

350
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
All right.

351
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:07,920
