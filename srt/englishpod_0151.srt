00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,880
We have an advanced lesson for you today.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,480
Katrina And my name is Katrin and I'm very excited

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
about this lesson, Marco.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,120
Marco It's very interesting.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,200
It's about a very controversial topic and a very popular person in history, Charles

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Darwin.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Katrina That's right.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,440
So he's most famous perhaps for his book, The Origin

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,520
of the Species and we're going to be talking a lot about science today.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,440
So put your thinking caps on.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,520
Marco Alright, so without further ado, why don't

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,440
we listen to this dialogue for the first time.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Man, it's been forever.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
What have you been up to lately?

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,360
Charles I've been busy preparing for my exams, not

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,600
to mention all the term papers I've had to write.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Katrina Same here.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm up to my neck in work, but at least we've got summer holidays after finals.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Where are you headed now?

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,640
Charles I'm going to my anthro class.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
or whatever.

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin!

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Katrina What?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why?

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
How can you not like Darwin?

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,760
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,800
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,900
Charles I don't like him.

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,560
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Katrina Say that again and you'll make enemies with

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,600
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,480
of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,840
and its very beginnings.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Charles I'm not minimizing his huge contributions

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
to science.

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,160
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,880
Katrina What are you talking about?

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,160
Charles Which came first?

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
The chicken or the egg?

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,800
This is a classic logical problem, and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,840
How did the very first living organism come to be?

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,400
Katrina Interesting.

48
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,860
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

49
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:16,800
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Alright, interesting, they have very different views on Charles Darwin, right?

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Katrina They do, and they're both pretty nerdy people.

52
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,680
This is a very nerdy university conversation that's happening between classes.

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
Charles Yeah, I think maybe they're like PhD candidates

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
or something.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Katrina Perhaps.

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
Alright, so before we get to talking about some of

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,120
the ideas in today's dialogue, let's talk about some of the words and phrases that we

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,880
hear to understand better what's going on.

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,640
The first part we're going to talk about in today's Language Takeaway.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Language Takeaway.

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,200
Charles Alright, on Language Takeaway today, let's

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
take a look at the first word.

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,440
And well, one of the things that many people say is that Darwin revolutionized the fields

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
of biology.

65
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,240
Katrina And so he revolutionized these because he

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,500
pushed them forward.

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,160
He made many changes.

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,680
He forced changes.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,120
So people had to change the way that they thought about these things.

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,160
Charles If you revolutionize something, a topic or an idea, you are creating new knowledge

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
almost, right?

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
Katrina Exactly.

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,480
You can think of the word revolution, which is a thing.

74
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,880
So you think of the Russian Revolution or the American Revolution.

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,640
These are times of change.

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,560
So to revolutionize is to bring about change.

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Charles Very good.

78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,660
Alright, so moving forward, they were talking about human evolution.

79
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,800
Human evolution.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
What is that exactly?

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Katrina Good question.

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
So you're not a monkey.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm not a monkey, but we come from monkeys, right?

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Charles So we evolved.

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Katrina Right.

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,240
So the process is called human evolution.

87
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,560
That means the process by which humans changed forms to become what we are today.

88
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
Charles Okay, so you evolve.

89
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Now is it evolution?

90
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,640
You usually think of something positive, right?

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,720
Something evolves into something better.

92
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Is it always that way?

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,240
Katrina No, we have another word for the negative,

94
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
right?

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,680
So the positive is to evolve, to become better.

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
To get worse is to devolve.

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Charles Okay.

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,880
Katrina Yeah, to devolve, to go back and to kind of

99
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,360
lose things that you had.

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Charles Okay, interesting.

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,560
And then they were also talking about Darwin's theory of natural selection.

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Natural selection.

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,680
Katrina Okay, this is maybe one of the things that

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,120
Darwin was most famous for, and that's why we've included it in this language takeaway

105
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,360
because it's a key phrase.

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
It's something you hear people talk about a lot.

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,840
Okay, so natural selection is a process again, and it's the process by which stronger animals

108
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,120
survive over time and weaker animals don't.

109
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,680
So if there's a weak species, it can't really survive because it keeps dying and dying,

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
and then finally there's no more.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,880
And so this is called natural selection because no one's actually choosing what animals will

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
survive, but it's kind of a natural process.

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
Charles Right, Mother Nature is choosing it.

114
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Katrina Right.

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Charles Very good.

116
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,240
So natural selection, this is one of the things that Darwin is most famous for.

117
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,120
And well, as Katrina mentioned, Darwin wrote the book Origin of the Species.

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Katrina Right, so origin means beginning.

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,640
So the origin of mankind, right?

120
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,240
So there are many different kinds of animals.

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,520
You could even say there are many different kinds of like mammals, but there are many

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,280
different species within that.

123
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,400
So human beings, black bears, koalas, chimpanzees, these are all species.

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,720
And so a species is a classification.

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,340
So the origin of the species is kind of a way of telling the story of how all these

126
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
things came about.

127
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,120
Charles All right, the origin of the species.

128
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
And the last one, this word is kind of strange.

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,600
He talked about the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
Katrina Okay, conundrum.

131
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,560
I love this word.

132
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,880
It's very funny sounding.

133
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Conundrum.

134
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,920
It means like a problem or a riddle or something that's hard to understand.

135
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,020
Charles All right.

136
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,760
So in this case, it's the conundrum of the chicken and the egg, right, which came first.

137
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,400
How else can you use conundrum?

138
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Katrina You could say that maybe there's a situation

139
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,160
that's very strange and hard to understand.

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
This is quite a conundrum.

141
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,400
Charles This is quite a conundrum we have.

142
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,320
It sounds very fancy, very well educated.

143
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Katrina It does.

144
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Charles All right.

145
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,120
So interesting words on language takeaway.

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,800
Why don't we move on now to four phrases on Fluency Builder.

147
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Fluency Builder.

148
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,520
All right, on Fluency Builder today, we have four phrases as we said.

149
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
So what's the first one?

150
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,040
Katrina The first one is great.

151
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
It's very visual.

152
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
You say, I'm up to my neck in work.

153
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,440
I'm up to my neck in papers to write.

154
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,480
All right, so this means I have so much stuff to do that you could pile it up and it would

155
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
come up to my neck.

156
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,920
Charles So I have as many papers that are almost as

157
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
tall as I am.

158
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Katrina Exactly.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,160
And so I could say I'm up to my neck in work.

160
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,800
I have no more time to do anything.

161
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,040
Charles Sometimes people also say I'm up to here

162
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,040
and then they'll like, they'll point at their forehead or somewhere around their head.

163
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm up to here with your nonsense.

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,640
Katrina Exactly.

165
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,840
So this is a way of saying that I'm really busy.

166
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Charles Really busy.

167
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm really tired of it.

168
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
All right.

169
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,000
And our next phrase is one that most mothers use.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sick and tired.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
Katrina I'm sick and tired of all of your whining.

172
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,640
Go do the dishes and don't complain.

173
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Charles Right.

174
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,160
So it's always, it always goes together.

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
You are sick and tired.

176
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Katrina Right.

177
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
And sick comes first.

178
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
So I'm sick and tired of this.

179
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm sick and tired of your bad attitude.

180
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Charles Okay.

181
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
So and that means that you are...

182
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Katrina I'm just tired of it.

183
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,040
I don't want you to have a bad attitude anymore.

184
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm just, yeah.

185
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,280
Charles I'm really annoyed by it.

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I'm annoyed.

187
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Okay.

188
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Sick and tired.

189
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,680
And then we saw a phrase that was a little bit separated.

190
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,800
He said the sentence went like this.

191
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,520
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

192
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,320
So to turn something on its head.

193
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,000
Katrina Like you said, Marco, it's split into two

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
parts.

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,280
So he turned the field of computer science on its head.

196
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,760
So to turn on its head means to completely reverse something, to turn it around.

197
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,120
You think 180 degrees.

198
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,760
And so if biology used to be one way, then Darwin made it completely different.

199
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
Charles So we can say that Isaac Newton completely

200
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
turned physics on its head with his theory or his findings on gravity.

201
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Katrina And then years and years later, we had Albert

202
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,840
Einstein who turned those theories or who turned that theory on its head with his own

203
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
ideas about physics.

204
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Charles Very good.

205
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,880
So to turn something on its head, to completely change the course of or prove something to

206
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
be maybe wrong.

207
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,760
And the last phrase that we have is the person argued that Darwin's theories were full of

208
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
holes.

209
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Katrina Okay.

210
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,480
So to say a theory is full of holes is a little bit

211
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,080
different than saying that his pants are full of holes.

212
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,360
Because when you say something is full of holes, maybe they actually have holes.

213
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,420
But a theory is it's an idea.

214
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,800
So it can't have holes.

215
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,600
What you're saying is that it's not completely sound.

216
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,960
It's not without some problems.

217
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,500
And so maybe you're saying that, well, the cookies are gone out of the kitchen, Marco.

218
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,940
And I saw you in the kitchen.

219
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,880
So clearly you ate the cookies.

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Charles Right.

221
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,080
So I can say that's full of holes because it was me and it was three other people who

222
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
were in the kitchen.

223
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
So you can't blame me.

224
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Katrina Ah, it could have been the other two people.

225
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Charles Right.

226
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,440
So if something is full of holes, it's that it has maybe mistakes or it's still missing

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
complete evidence to prove it right.

228
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
Katrina Or it has bad logic.

229
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Charles Bad logic.

230
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
All right.

231
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Interesting.

232
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and different phrases here.

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,880
Let's listen to this argument one last time.

234
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:36,600
Man, it's been forever.

235
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
What have you been up to lately?

236
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,960
I've been busy preparing for my exams, not to mention all the term papers I've had to

237
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
write.

238
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Same here.

239
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm up to my neck in work, but at least we've got summer holidays after finals.

240
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Where are you headed now?

241
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm going to my anthro class.

242
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,960
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or

243
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
whatever.

244
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin.

245
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
What?

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Why?

247
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,120
How can you not like Darwin?

248
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,260
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

249
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,200
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.

250
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
I don't like him.

251
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,360
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

252
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,960
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

253
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,760
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.

254
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,040
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process

255
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,920
of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world

256
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,840
and its very beginnings.

257
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

258
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,640
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

259
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,680
What are you talking about?

260
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,980
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

261
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,240
This is a classic logical problem and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

262
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
How did the very first living organism come to be?

263
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,840
Interesting.

264
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,320
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.

265
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:15,960
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

266
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
All right, we're back.

267
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,000
It's interesting, Darwin's theories and his explanations for the origin of species and

268
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
life as we know it.

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,120
But there is the opposite to this, right?

270
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,840
There is a certain thing called creationism.

271
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,560
There is and this is a big source of controversy, especially in the United States because in

272
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,880
some places people want to teach creationism as well as evolution in schools.

273
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
So this is the big question.

274
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,480
Are they still equal as theories or is one theory more proven than the other?

275
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Right.

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,840
And it is kind of hard to determine which one is better because one is based on faith,

277
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,360
the other one is based more on scientific evidence, right?

278
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,880
So they're not really even on the same scale as we learned before.

279
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,160
That's kind of like apples and oranges, right?

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,480
It is and there are some people who would say that we have lots of ways of quote unquote

281
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,320
proving what happened in the past but as long as we weren't there, we never really do know.

282
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,000
And there's always changes in science so how can we be sure that what we know now isn't

283
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,680
false, isn't misunderstanding.

284
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I think for now, this is the best explanation but that doesn't mean that it's the correct

285
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
one.

286
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Maybe in a hundred years from now, we'll have another explanation that's much better or

287
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,960
maybe complimentary to this one.

288
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,800
So we want to know what you guys think, come to our website englishpod.com.

289
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,280
We really want to hear your opinions.

290
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
What do you think about this topic?

291
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,360
It is a little bit controversial so we really look forward to your comments and any other

292
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,840
questions you may have.

293
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Yep.

294
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,160
And just a reference, creationism is the idea that God created the world or a superior being

295
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,600
created the world and that everything came from that.

296
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,480
And so let us know what you think.

297
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
I am very curious too and that's about it for today.

298
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Alright.

299
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
We'll see you guys there.

300
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
You're taking off for a walk.
