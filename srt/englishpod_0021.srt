00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello, English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,700
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,640
And today we're bringing you a great intermediate lesson with some really useful vocabulary.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,880
Some vocabulary you can use to describe your job.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
Yes.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,920
This is a really common situation when someone asks you what you do and you have to tell

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
them.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Exactly.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,460
So today's lesson is all about that.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,320
So before we jump into our dialogue, let's start with our vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,620
Vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,020
We have two simple phrases today that you'll hear in our dialogue for our vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,020
The first one is VP.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,020
VP.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,020
VP.

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,420
So the VP of a company is?

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,420
The vice president.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,740
The vice president.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,740
Exactly.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,740
Yeah.

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,740
Simple little acronym.

23
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,580
And the next word is Fortune 500 company.

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,540
Fortune 500 company.

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,820
Fortune 500 company.

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,020
So a Fortune 500 company is?

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,580
I'll let you explain.

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,980
Well, Fortune magazine ranks the 500 biggest companies in the US.

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,840
So a Fortune 500 company basically is?

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,060
One of the 500 biggest companies in the US.

31
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,060
Okay.

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,060
That's simple.

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,060
Yep.

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
All right.

35
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,660
Well, with those words, it sounds like we're going to be talking to some important people

36
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,660
today.

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,100
We are going to be talking to some important people.

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,260
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

39
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,580
Now it's going to be a little bit fast, but you don't have to worry about it.

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,540
Because we'll come back and explain all of the important vocabulary.

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,140
Oh, look.

42
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,140
There's Caroline and her boyfriend.

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,660
She's always going on about him at the office.

44
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,660
Great.

45
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
They saw us.

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
They're coming this way.

47
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Oh, man.

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,660
Jessica, Arthur.

49
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Hi.

50
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,660
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

51
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
He's the VP of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

52
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,660
This is my husband, Arthur.

54
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Hey, how's it going?

55
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
Hello.

56
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
Caroline talks about you all the time.

57
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,660
I guess he must be pretty busy at work.

58
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,660
Well, yeah.

59
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:26,100
VP position is not easy, you know.

60
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,860
I implement policies and procedures nationwide in various departments, as well as trained

61
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,700
junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

62
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,220
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

63
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,700
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

64
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Wow.

65
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,580
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

66
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,860
And what about you, Arthur?

67
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,580
What do you do for a living?

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,580
I'm a top gun pilot.

69
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:08,180
All right.

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,380
Great music for our dialogue again, huh?

71
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
Chosen by?

72
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
By moi.

73
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,380
Of course.

74
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,780
Yeah, Top Gun is one of my all-time favorite movies.

75
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,080
And top gun pilot, what a cool profession.

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,340
An excellent profession.

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Much cooler than being like the VP.

78
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Yeah.

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,340
How boring is that?

80
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
Yeah.

81
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk, don't you think?

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Yeah, you can tell a little bit of the sarcastic tone he had in his voice.

83
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Definitely.

84
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,500
But he did use some interesting phrases and we can talk about those now.

85
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Right.

86
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,060
So let's take a look at language takeaway.

87
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,140
Language takeaway.

88
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,260
Our first word for language takeaways is implement.

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Implement.

90
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,260
Implement.

91
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Implement.

92
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,860
Let's listen to some examples of this word to help us understand its meaning.

93
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,220
Example one.

94
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,620
Our company has to implement this sales strategy.

95
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,780
Example two.

96
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,100
Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan.

97
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,140
Example three.

98
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,940
I implemented several new policies.

99
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,180
Okay, great examples.

100
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,180
And just in case, to implement means to put into action.

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Put into action.

102
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
Great.

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Exactly.

104
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,180
Our second word for language takeaway, policies.

105
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Policies.

106
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
Policies.

107
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,180
Policies.

108
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,020
So, policies are basically rules and regulations.

109
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Exactly.

110
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Formal rules.

111
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,900
For a company or an organization.

112
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Exactly.

113
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Policies.

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Great.

115
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Third word.

116
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Oversee.

117
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Oversee.

118
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Oversee.

119
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Oversee.

120
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,900
So, when you oversee operations, it means?

121
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,220
Like, you watch it to make sure it's okay.

122
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,420
You supervise it.

123
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,900
This is an excellent word to use when you want to talk about your job responsibilities.

124
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Right.

125
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Oversee.

126
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Mm-hmm.

127
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Great.

128
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,420
And our last word for language takeaway, it's kind of tricky, so let's listen to how it

129
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,480
was used in our dialogue.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,420
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

131
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,860
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

132
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,700
So this guy has 1,500 employees under him, meaning he supervises 1,500 employees.

133
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Right.

134
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,980
He manages 1,500 employees.

135
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,540
He must be a busy man.

136
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Yes.

137
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
For 1,500 employees.

138
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,460
How many employees do you have under you, Erica?

139
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
Two.

140
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
Yeah.

141
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,460
Not quite as much as 1,500.

142
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,380
I guess I'm not a VP right yet, hey?

143
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,860
Not yet, but you will.

144
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
Okay.

145
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
All right.

146
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,220
So, with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our dialogue for a second time, and this

147
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,860
time it's going to be slower.

148
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,900
Oh, look.

149
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,460
There's Caroline and her boyfriend.

150
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,060
She's always going on about him at the office.

151
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh, great.

152
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,620
They saw us.

153
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,660
They're coming this way.

154
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Oh, man.

155
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,980
Jessica, Arthur, hi.

156
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,700
I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Greg.

157
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:32,140
He's the VP of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

158
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Nice to meet you.

159
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,780
This is my husband, Arthur.

160
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,300
Hey, how's it going?

161
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Hello.

162
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,580
Caroline talks about you all the time.

163
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,140
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

164
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,820
Well, yeah.

165
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,740
A VP position is not easy, you know.

166
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,820
I implement policies and procedures nationwide of various departments, as well as train junior

167
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,260
managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

168
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:07,020
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

169
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,380
That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me.

170
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,740
Wow.

171
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,060
Yeah.

172
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,860
That sounds exciting.

173
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,140
And what about you, Arthur?

174
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
What do you do for a living?

175
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,180
Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

176
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,220
Okay, great stuff.

177
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,900
With this, now we can start with our fluency builder for today.

178
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,100
Fluency Builder.

179
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,460
We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue, some phrases that sound really natural, hey?

180
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,260
Yes, especially the first one that we have today is whenever someone talks and talks

181
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:53,100
and talks and just, and continuously talks without stopping, you would say...

182
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,340
She's always going on about him at the office.

183
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,820
She's always going on about him at the office.

184
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,380
This is a really natural way of saying keeps talking about.

185
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,140
Right, keeps talking about him.

186
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,620
So we have a few examples of how this phrase works.

187
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,340
Let's listen.

188
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,780
Example one.

189
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,460
My boss is always going on about how we need to save money.

190
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,700
It's all he talks about.

191
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Example two.

192
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,420
Gary is always going on about his kids.

193
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:40,940
He's always talking about how smart they are.

194
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,500
Example three.

195
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,780
My mom is always going on about how I should get married.

196
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,620
Okay, excellent.

197
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
It's clear now.

198
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,620
Yes.

199
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,860
Okay, so let's move on to our second phrase for today and this is a great one to use whenever

200
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,740
you meet someone for the first time.

201
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,420
Or when you start to talk to someone for the first time.

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,740
Hey, how's it going?

203
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,860
Hey, how's it going?

204
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,340
So this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying how are you?

205
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
How are you?

206
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Yeah.

207
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,820
So yeah, you can just say, hey, how's it going?

208
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Yeah.

209
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Great.

210
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Really natural sounding.

211
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,780
Now, our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue.

212
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Yes.

213
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,260
And it's a really common situation.

214
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,580
When someone asks you about your job, they might say this.

215
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,140
Arthur, what do you do for a living?

216
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,020
Arthur, what do you do for a living?

217
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,460
So this is a really great way of asking what work do you do or what is your job?

218
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Yes.

219
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,460
I know a lot of students sometimes say, what is your job?

220
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Yeah.

221
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,900
And that is, it's kind of correct, but not really.

222
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,380
It doesn't sound very natural.

223
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
Right.

224
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,820
So you can use, what do you do?

225
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,340
Or what do you do for a living?

226
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
Sounds great.

227
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,060
That's the way you ask someone what is their job.

228
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,820
And that's how you sound super natural.

229
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Okay.

230
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,140
So we're ready now to listen to our dialogue a last time.

231
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,860
And now you are ready to understand everything.

232
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:24,420
Oh, look, there's Caroline and her boyfriend.

233
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Oh man.

234
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Hey, how's it going?

235
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,500
Caroline talks about you all the time.

236
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

237
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,980
Well, yeah, VP position is not easy to know.

238
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,020
I implement policies and procedures nationwide, various departments, as well as trained junior

239
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,620
managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

240
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,100
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

241
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,620
That alone means I have 1500 employees under me.

242
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,460
Wow, yeah, that sounds exciting.

243
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,740
And what about you, Arthur?

244
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,500
What do you do for a living?

245
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:43,820
I'm a top gun pilot.

246
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,440
Okay so I have a little challenge for our listeners today.

247
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
What is it?

248
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
I have two challenges.

249
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Okay.

250
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,380
The first one, who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called?

251
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,340
Okay, I don't know the answer.

252
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,620
So I'm looking forward to seeing what users do.

253
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,940
And the second one is, what is the number one company in the Fortune 500?

254
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,860
Oh, I also don't know this answer.

255
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,860
Two great questions.

256
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,980
So I expect to see your answers on the comments page.

257
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,460
But also we want to know about your profession.

258

Yes.
