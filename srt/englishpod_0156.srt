00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,640
And my name is Catherine and today we have a very scary story.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Spooky.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,160
We're actually bringing you the first of our advanced media lessons and what better way

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,720
to start it with than a scary story for Halloween.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
Than with.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Than with.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,760
So what better way to start this advanced media lesson than with a scary story.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Right.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,600
So Halloween is coming up and advanced media usually features a new story or some kind

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,720
of story that we can then kind of break down and talk about.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,240
Just have a conversation about because you're advanced level learners and you want to have

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
fun with English.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,360
So where is today's spooky story set Marco?

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,680
Well it starts out with a guy who remembers something very scary that happened to him

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,400
when he was a kid.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,480
Okay and so one of the main characters in today's story is his great aunt.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,360
That's right his great aunt.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,320
And so basically this is a family member but it's your father's aunt.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Right.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,720
Your grandmother or your grandfather's sister.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Right.

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,800
Alright so your aunt or your aunt is your parent's sibling.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,080
But in this case we're talking about one generation older than that.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,640
So you could say great aunt, great uncle, great grandfather, great grandmother.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,920
It's like one step back.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,900
So this is usually a very old person and the great aunt is definitely an important character

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,000
in today's story.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Exactly.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
So let's not keep you in suspense any longer.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,400
Why don't we listen to this scary story and we'll be right back to talk about it.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,560
Oh no the lights went out.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Honey can you light a candle?

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Sure.

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
What do we do now?

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,840
Well we can just talk you know like we used to.

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I know.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,760
I'll tell you a scary story.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,680
It happened to me and my dad when I was a teenager.

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,720
I was living with my father at the time when he received a phone call.

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Hello.

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Yes this is him.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I see.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Sorry to hear that.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Okay no problem.

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
I'll be there shortly.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,160
Pack some clothes Tony.

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,960
My great aunt is very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her.

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,400
We're going to stay at her house for a few days.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Aunt?

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
What aunt?

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
I never knew you had a great aunt.

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,320
Well the family doesn't talk about her or get near her for that matter.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,680
Why is that?

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Come on we have to go.

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,720
So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of our town.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,240
There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it.

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,900
Once inside the house we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad's great

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,200
aunt in a wheelchair yelling at someone but we were alone in the room.

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,480
Hi Aunt Ursula.

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
This is my son Tony.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Why have you come?

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Why are you here?

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Don't you know it isn't safe?

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,280
My time is near.

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
He's coming for me.

68
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,720
Who is coming for you?

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
The Prince of Darkness.

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
The Lord of the Underworld.

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
The Tempter.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
The Old Serpent.

73
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Come on.

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,360
Aunt Ursula let's lay you down.

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,160
You need to get some rest.

76
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,400
Tony help me lay her down.

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,840
That night we slept in one of the 12 rooms of that big old mansion.

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,320
The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed ghoulish shapes on my

79
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
bed.

80
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
All of a sudden we heard screaming.

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Oh my God!

82
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
I can't believe it!

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I won't let you take me!

84
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Oh my God!

85
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I can't believe it!

86
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
I won't let you take me!

87
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Oh my God!

88
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I can't believe it!

89
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
I won't let you take me!

90
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
I won't let you take me!

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Oh my God!

92
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
I can't believe it!

93
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I won't let you take me!

94
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Dad!

95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Dad!

96
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Dad!

97
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Something is attacking Aunt Ursula.

98
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:03,200
The door is jammed, stand back!

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Aunt Ursula where are you?

100
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,480
Over here!

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,060
And as we approached her she was lying on the floor with her hands and feet open like

102
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,400
the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs

103
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,380
and face.

104
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,900
Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheelchair?

105
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,140
My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year.

106
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,580
After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell

107
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,740
and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her.

108
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,620
As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk.

109
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,420
My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her.

110
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:57,140
When she lost her voice and laid on her deathbed, I would hear her breathe in and out.

111
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,260
Until finally one day, she breathed in and never exhaled.

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:13,180
That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over, but it wasn't.

113
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,300
I was so terrified of what I was hearing that I didn't sleep all night.

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,220
The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn

115
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,220
up, but I found everything exactly as it was before.

116
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,380
The movers came that same day and as we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items,

117
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,180
we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them.

118
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,700
We found pictures with people's faces sewn with black or red string.

119
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,580
And you want to know what the strangest thing was?

120
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,020
There was a small doll filled with dead ants, with a strand of hair tied around its waist.

121
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,800
And on the doll's face, there was a picture of me with the numbers 31-10-09.

122
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,740
You know what date it is today?

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,100
October 31st, 2009.

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Alright, we're back.

125
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,460
So, what did you think?

126
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,780
Pretty scary?

127
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
I got goosebumps.

128
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,780
It's a little spooky.

129
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
A little scary.

130
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,740
Now, what's interesting about this story, it's based on a true story, so that makes

131
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
it even scarier.

132
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
No.

133
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
Yeah.

134
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Dare I ask, did this happen to you?

135
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
No, no.

136
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,420
I'm not old enough, but this actually happened to a family member of mine, and that's why

137
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
I know this story.

138
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,220
So, it was kind of told to me when I was a bit younger and I remembered it.

139
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,780
And well, Halloween is a great time to remember these things.

140
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,220
And the first time you heard it, it scared the crap out of you, right?

141
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Oh yeah, for sure.

142
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,740
Actually, the first time I heard it, we were on an airplane, like on October 31st.

143
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Oh wow.

144
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
So, it was pretty scary.

145
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,860
Well, we've got a lot of really interesting stuff here.

146
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,820
We're not going to dwell too long on the grammar or the vocabulary because we assume that most

147
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,500
of you have understood this, but there are a couple of things that can be really difficult

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,900
even for English speakers.

149
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,300
So, the first one is this phrase, my time is near.

150
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,060
My time is near.

151
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
So, what does that mean exactly?

152
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,500
Well, my time is near, my end is coming.

153
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,660
It means I'm very old and I'm probably going to die soon.

154
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,220
So my time, his time, that's when you die.

155
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,460
Okay, so it's always used in reference to death, right?

156
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
In this case, yeah.

157
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,380
So, it's used in reference to death and in this case, we have the aunt who's talking

158
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,740
about herself, but you could also say his time is coming, we should visit him in the

159
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
hospital.

160
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,460
So, it's a kind of softer way of saying that someone is going to die soon.

161
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
Right.

162
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,660
Okay, so my time is near or his time is near.

163
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
All right.

164
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,460
And then, something really interesting in this story as well, she had many different

165
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,540
names that she called the devil.

166
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,740
So, she didn't directly say the devil, she said the prince of darkness.

167
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,980
Prince of darkness, lord of the underworld, the tempter.

168
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,780
The tempter and the old serpent.

169
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,700
So, these are actually different ways that historically have been used to describe the

170
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
devil, right?

171
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
That's right.

172
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,340
And a lot of them are biblical, like the old serpent, you know, back in the first pages

173
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,780
of the Bible when the serpent tempts Eve, that's the devil.

174
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,940
And so, we hear a lot of these, especially on Halloween, these are great words to use

175
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,380
to kind of diversify and not say devil, devil, devil.

176
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
Right.

177
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,380
Okay.

178
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,860
So, apart from those synonyms for the devil, she also used an interesting phrase towards

179
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,660
the end when she said, I shall be judged before you can take me.

180
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Hmm.

181
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,700
So, judged, to judge, this is to see if something is right or wrong.

182
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,380
But in this case, we talk about judgment at the end of a person's life.

183
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,820
So, that means when you go to the gates of heaven and there's Saint Peter and he has

184
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,420
a list of the good and the bad and he says yes or no.

185
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Right.

186
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,100
And then if you're a no, you get sent down to hell.

187
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
If you're a yes, you go to heaven.

188
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,580
So, she says, I shall be judged.

189
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
This means, I want my day in court.

190
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,300
I want to have my actions analyzed by Saint Peter, not by you.

191
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Right, exactly.

192
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,100
So, actually, this makes reference to a lot of beliefs in Christianity, right?

193
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,900
So, it's just another aspect of the story.

194
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,500
But of course, other religions probably don't have the same things such as the gates of

195
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
heaven and Saint Peter.

196
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Right, the system of judgment.

197
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Alright.

198
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
So, what did you think of the story?

199
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,740
Did you like it?

200
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,340
I really liked it.

201
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,540
I thought it was really spooky and I thought that it built up well.

202
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,860
But I really also like the imagery.

203
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,620
We talked about, or we haven't talked about this yet, but he describes his great aunt,

204
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,460
the character describes his great aunt as being spread out like the Vitruvian man.

205
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,900
So, you have this image of her arms spread out and her legs spread out.

206
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,860
You know that picture that da Vinci did of a human being and it's like an anatomy and

207
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,260
it's in a circle and you can see the legs and the arms.

208
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,340
That's just so really like a powerful visual image.

209
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,740
Yeah, you can imagine her laying on the bed in this position, right?

210
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,020
Yeah, it is pretty scary.

211
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
What about you?

212
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,780
Have you ever had any close encounters with the supernatural or ghosts or goblins or something

213
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
like this?

214
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,220
No, personally I've never had any experiences like that and I tend to not believe those

215
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,980
stories but maybe if this had happened to someone I knew I'd be a little bit more skeptical

216
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,820
or less skeptical.

217
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,460
What about when they have those documentaries or those recordings of strange voices or

218
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,700
appearances like these old castles in England or stuff like that?

219
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
What do you think?

220
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
I love those shows.

221
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,380
I just watched one and it was about a haunted house.

222
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,780
There was a woman who used a Ouija board and it let a demon out and the demon possessed

223
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,140
the girl and they called in a priest and the priest had to like exorcise the demon from

224
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,340
the little girl and the house was haunted and it was hurting people and it was like

225
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
possessing people.

226
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Wow, it sounds like a movie.

227
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,940
Yeah, it does but it was like a TV show on Discovery Channel and it was really, really

228
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
fun.

229
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,500
I don't actually believe that a spirit could push someone down the stairs.

230
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,820
I think that you trip and then you attribute it to a spirit.

231
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,820
What about the Ouija board?

232
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,600
That's an interesting tool that many people say opens up portals and dimensions towards

233
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,940
hell or spirits can come out and stuff like that.

234
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,280
Well, for those of you who don't know, the Ouija board is a board, like a piece of cardboard

235
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,700
that has letters on it, letters and numbers.

236
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,420
You have this glass that you hold and once the spirit comes, it guides the glass to point

237
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,380
out to names or places and you spell them.

238
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,820
They're really popular with like 13-year-old girls who have these slumber parties and they

239
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,500
use it and we always say, you know, who is she going to date and then it moves.

240
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,460
But yeah, I believe in the power of the human mind so I think a lot of times even if we're

241
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,140
not aware of it, we're the ones manipulating this.

242
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,900
Or believing what we want to believe.

243
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Yeah, but what about you?

244
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Are you superstitious?

245
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Do you believe in ghosts?

246
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,260
I'm not superstitious.

247
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,140
I don't know what to think about ghosts because I've actually had a couple of very strange

248
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,460
encounters with the supernatural but I really wouldn't say, oh yeah, I believe in ghosts

249
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,620
or I believe there are spirits that haven't been put to rest or they have unfinished business,

250
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,620
you know, like in Casper or something like that.

251
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,340
But once we were having dinner with my family in the house where we used to live and it

252
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:36,020
was a very old house and we had a glass of water on the table and all of a sudden it

253
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,780
started to move and to rotate across the table, the center of the table and we all saw it

254
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,480
and no one was touching it.

255
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,900
So we all were pretty confused and nervous and then just kind of burst out in nervous

256
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,620
laughter and we didn't really know what to make of it but it was very strange because

257
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,220
it moved a good amount, it was like half of the table and it was spinning at the same

258
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,780
time so it was very strange.

259
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Weird.

260
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:04,900
So, things like this and, you know, in general Hispanic or Latin American culture are, they're

261
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,660
very superstitious.

262
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,500
They have a lot of beliefs in like magic or some people still say, are reluctant to give

263
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,140
out a picture for example because of something like this in the story.

264
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Really?

265
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,260
They don't give out pictures to boyfriends or girlfriends or anyone because if you break

266
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,220
up or something is to happen then they could do something with that picture and maybe hurt

267
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
you.

268
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Really?

269
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,340
So this idea that you have a likeness, like a picture or a doll or something, can you

270
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,340
talk about that because I don't really know anything about it.

271
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,980
Having that means that you're able to like do something to that very person?

272
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,780
Like, not necessarily like a voodoo doll, right?

274
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,380
Where you see that you can put pins in it and then it would hurt someone.

275
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,620
But people believe that pictures, for example, they capture your image and so if somebody

276
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,780
has it and wants to do harm or black magic then they can use that as an instrument to

277
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
get into you.

278
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,780
Okay.

279
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,820
The same as pieces of clothing or the same as hair and things like this.

280
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:13,500
So that's why there are the shamans or the Indian witch doctors who do cleansing like

281
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,620
this and people still actually go to them.

282
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,900
People in the city still believe in these things and they'll go to a shaman and get

283
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:25,620
themselves cleansed because they believe that their luck, they have really bad luck or they've

284
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,660
been very, very sick for a long time and doctors can't figure out what it is.

285
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,140
They think it's because someone has cast a spell on them or is doing some black magic

286
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,980
to them and they need to get it cleansed.

287
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Oh, wow.

288
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,300
So, yeah, it's really, really common.

289
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:46,820
But it's all part of the folklore and the heritage of the countries.

290
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,020
It's actually very, very interesting and some things are just really out there, really weird.

291
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Yeah?

292
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Yeah.

293
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,140
Well, a lot of it I think comes from indigenous beliefs mixing with Catholicism too, right?

294
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Yeah, exactly.

295
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,260
Because a lot of South American countries and Latin American countries are very Catholic

296
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,140
but they get kind of melded, these traditions with indigenous beliefs and then you have

297
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,260
these crazy rituals and like...

298
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,900
We actually have a belief and it's very true that when somebody is completely in love with

299
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,900
this girl and this girl is maybe not very nice or not very nice to that guy but he's

300
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,620
still completely into her.

301
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,820
So, there's this word that we say that he's been like underweared or something like that.

302
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,540
And the reason behind this is that one of these rituals that I talked about is that

303
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,820
the girl would make tea, right?

304
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,500
Would take a tea pot and in it would put her underpants, used underpants to make the tea

305
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,340
water and then would serve it to the guy.

306
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,180
So, the moment that he drank it, this was like a magic potion and then he would continuously

307
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
be in love with her.

308
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
Oh.

309
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,180
So, yeah, it's very strange.

310
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,180
That's gross.

311
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
Do people actually do that?

312
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,180
No.

313
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,500
It's not something that you do now but it's something that people knew about that used

314
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,340
to be done way, way before.

315
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Okay.

316
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
So, people now...

317
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,020
It's part of the language where you say that someone has been like...

318
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
Underweared or something like that.

319
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,060
She cast a spell on him maybe what we would say.

320
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,700
So, things like this that of course aren't really done anymore but still people make

321
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,060
reference to it because we know it from our history that it's been done before.

322
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
How cool.

323
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,080
Well, I'm really curious to know if our users have any similar stories or have any scary

324
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,420
stories they want to tell.

325
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,660
I bet they do.

326
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm sure they do.

327
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,980
And this advanced media lesson is a great place for you to do that because we expect

328
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,280
that a lot of advanced level learners are going to be listening to it and practicing

329
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
your writing is really important.

330
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,240
So, we hope that you'll put some comments on this lesson and of course ask us as many

331
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
questions as you want.

332
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
All right.

333
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,860
So, we'll see you guys there and have a happy Halloween.

334
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Happy Halloween.

335
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:56,140
Bye.
