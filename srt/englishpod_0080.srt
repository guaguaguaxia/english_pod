00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,120
And I'm Erika.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,240
And today we're bringing you again our romantic, dramatic, suspense series, I'm Sorry I Love

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,820
You Part 7.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,080
So we're gonna find out what's happening with Steven and Veronica.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,400
Right, in the last episode, Veronica was at the doctor's, she was pregnant.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,760
But then the doctor told her it was a lie and he made it up and she wasn't even pregnant.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Exactly.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,960
So now let's see what Veronica and Steven are gonna say to each other.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Maybe they will break up?

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
I don't know.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
I don't think so.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:47,440
But let's listen.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
Thank God you showed up when you did.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
He's insane.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,480
Do you think we should call the police?

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Don't worry about it.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,720
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,880
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
What a nutjob.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
I know.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,560
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,560
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,240
Don't apologize.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,760
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,400
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just...

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm just scared, Veronica.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,680
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,040
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,760
We were made for each other, Veronica.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
You're my everything.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
My soulmate.

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,400
What can I do?

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Just hold me.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,680
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,800
I believe in us, Steven.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm so happy to hear that.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I know we belong together.

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I love you so much.

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:57,760
I love you so much.

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:12,520
It was such a romantic moment.

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
And now what happened?

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Somebody got shot.

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Oh my God.

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I don't know.

48
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
This is like so big.

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
I can't believe this is happening.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,320
Well, it's a very intense drama, but we saw some great words and a lot of great phrases

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,880
in there when Steven was telling her all these beautiful words, right?

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
That's right.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,640
So why don't we look at some of these words now in Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,960
Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,680
Veronica was glad or she was very happy that Steven showed up.

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
That's right.

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Showed up.

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
So, to show up.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Right.

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
To come to a place.

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Okay.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Or to arrive.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
That's right.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,640
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use show up in different contexts.

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,720
Example one.

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,000
We were waiting for you like an hour and you never showed up.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,320
Example two.

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
I didn't invite him to the party.

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,320
He just simply showed up uninvited.

70
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,040
Example three.

71
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,800
After months of being lost, my dog finally showed up with a family.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,040
All right.

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
So I think it's pretty clear now the verb show up.

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,080
And I think this verb is a little bit informal, isn't it?

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Yes.

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,280
You wouldn't really tell your boss, hey, I'm waiting for you to show up.

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Yeah.

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Yeah.

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
It's a bit too informal.

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,320
As you know, the doctor, he was stalking Veronica.

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
That's right.

82
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
So that's our next word.

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
To stalk.

84
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
To stalk somebody.

85
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
S-T-A-L-K.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Okay.

87
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Stalk.

88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Now, this isn't a good thing, right?

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
No.

90
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
This is bad.

91
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,520
So what happens when you stalk someone?

92
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,800
You follow them secretly for a long time.

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,520
And then maybe you watch them and...

94
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Yeah.

95
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,560
Like you're standing outside their window watching them get undressed or something.

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Okay.

97
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,960
So many famous people have stalkers, right?

98
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Yeah.

99
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Which is the noun.

100
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
The noun form, exactly.

101
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,800
So if I am stalking somebody, I am considered to be a stalker.

102
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes.

103
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
So to stalk.

104
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,720
So don't do this.

105
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
So Stephen described this stalker as a nut job.

106
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
A nut job.

107
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
A nut job.

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
A nut job.

109
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Okay.

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,160
Very, very informal and it doesn't really mean anything literally, but it's crazy.

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Yes.

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
It means a crazy person.

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
A crazy person.

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
What a nut job.

115
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
He's a nut job.

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Okay.

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,920
So would you really call this to someone, like to their face?

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
No.

119
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Definitely not.

120
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
It's definitely impolite.

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Right.

122
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,320
You can't say to someone, oh, you're a nut job.

123
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Yeah.

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
But it's not a swear word.

125
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,080
No, but it's a little bit insulting, right?

126
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,760
It's like saying you're crazy, but stronger.

127
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,680
Well, the doctor was a nut job.

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,080
He was stalking her and she apologized to Stephen for getting him worked up.

129
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,120
Worked up.

130
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,520
So work up.

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
To be worked up.

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
When you get worked up, what happens?

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,200
You get really emotional and usually angry or sad or upset, but a negative emotion.

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Okay.

135
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,680
So you got worked up.

136
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,120
So it's always used with the verb to get.

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
So to get worked up.

138
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Okay.

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
You get worked up.

140
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
You got worked up.

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Okay.

142
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Very good.

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,940
And well, Stephen got worked up over nothing, but he didn't mind.

144
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,920
He said she is his love and he called her his soulmate.

145
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
His soulmate.

146
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Soulmate.

147
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
That's right.

148
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,920
That's a very romantic word, meaning the perfect person for you.

149
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Right.

150
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Your other half.

151
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes.

152
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Okay.

153
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,880
So your soulmate is that perfect compliment for you.

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,840
And it's usually romantic, right?

155
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,960
Usually romantic, but sometimes you might use it with your very, very, very best friend.

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Okay.

157
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,440
Because you understand each other.

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Yeah.

159
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
You know what the other one's thinking.

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,480
You're the perfect fit together.

161
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Okay.

162
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Soulmate.

163
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Very good.

164
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, we've seen some really interesting words.

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,200
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and look at some

166
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,280
of the phrases that were used.

167
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
Thank God you showed up when you did.

168
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
He's insane.

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,320
Do you think we should call the police?

170
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Don't worry about it.

171
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,600
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
What a nut job.

174
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I know.

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

176
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,760
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

177
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,680
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

178
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
Don't apologize.

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,880
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,800
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just scared, Veronica.

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,620
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

182
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,000
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,720
We were made for each other, Veronica.

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
You're my everything.

185
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
My soulmate.

186
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
What can I do?

187
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Just hold me.

188
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,560
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

190
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,600
I believe in us, Steven.

191
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm so happy to hear that.

192
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,960
I know we belong together.

193
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,680
I love you so much.

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,040
That was a little bit more clear this time, but now I want to look at some phrases in

195
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,440
the dialogue and see how they can be put together.

196
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
Putting it together.

197
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,880
So Veronica apologized to Steven for getting him worked up over nothing.

198
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Over nothing.

199
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Over nothing.

200
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
Now it's the complete sentence.

201
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm sorry for getting you worked up over nothing.

202
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,680
So over nothing means for no reason, right?

203
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Right, exactly.

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,600
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use over nothing.

205
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,680
Example one.

206
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,040
You always get angry over nothing.

207
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,640
You have such a bad temper.

208
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,320
Example two.

209
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,480
I called the police last night over nothing.

210
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,280
I thought I had a thief in my house.

211
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Example three.

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's not fight over nothing.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,880
Let's just have dinner in peace.

214
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,560
Okay so we see you can use many different verbs together with over nothing.

215
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,160
So get excited over nothing, get angry over nothing, get upset over nothing.

216
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Exactly.

217
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Very good.

218
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
So over nothing.

219
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,140
And now for our next phrase.

220
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,040
So when Steven was telling Veronica how much he loved her, he told her, not a day has

221
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,840
gone by when I haven't thought of you.

222
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,960
So not a day has gone by.

223
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,200
So that part of the sentence, not a day has gone by, what does he mean by that?

224
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,640
He means basically every day I think of you.

225
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,600
There hasn't been a moment where I haven't thought of you.

226
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,320
Now how can we change it a little bit?

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
What can we change within this phrase?

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
Well, you can put in different times.

229
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,600
So not a day has gone by, not an hour has gone by, not a moment has gone by.

230
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Not a month, not a year.

231
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Exactly.

232
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,000
So you can use different times in that phrase.

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,880
But an important thing is that the complement is always negative, right?

234
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
That's right.

235
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,540
So it's always followed by a negative.

236
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,960
Not a day has gone by that I haven't wished you were here.

237
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,880
So it's followed by a negative.

238
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
That's right.

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
Maybe one more.

240
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,120
Not a second has gone by that I haven't missed you.

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Very good examples.

242
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Very romantic.

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Oh Marco.

244
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Yeah.

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
All right.

246
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,400
And now our last phrase.

247
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,580
He told her I'll always be here for you no matter what.

248
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,040
No matter what.

249
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
No matter what.

250
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
No matter what.

251
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
What does he mean by that?

252
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,160
Well, regardless of or you know, nothing's going to stop me.

253
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Okay.

254
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,360
So if I want to get that job, I'm going to get it no matter what.

255
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
So nothing's going to stop you.

256
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Now we can change the WH word, what, at the end, right?

257
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Yeah.

258
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
With other ones.

259
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Exactly.

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,320
So, no matter where you are, I will find you.

261
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Yeah.

262
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
No matter when.

263
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
No matter when your birthday is, I will be there.

264
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
That's right.

265
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,480
You can see how you can use different WH words here.

266
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Okay.

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Very good.

268
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
And it's a very common phrase, right?

269
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
No matter what.

270
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
No matter where.

271
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
No matter when.

272
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
No matter why.

273
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
No matter how.

274
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Yeah.

275
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
No matter how.

276
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Okay.

277
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,200
So those were some really great phrases and I think you can play with them a little bit,

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,000
change some things and then you can use them in your everyday life.

279
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Right.

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But why don't we hear them again one more time in context with the dialogue.

281
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,240
Thank God you showed up when you did.

282
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
He's insane.

283
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
Do you think we should call the police?

284
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Don't worry about it.

285
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

286
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

287
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
What a nut job.

288
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I know.

289
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,080
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

290
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,160
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

291
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,080
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

292
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,760
Don't apologize.

293
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,280
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

294
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,460
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just scared, Veronica.

295
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,220
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

296
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,600
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

297
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,280
We were made for each other, Veronica.

298
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,240
You're my everything, my soulmate.

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
What can I do?

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Just hold me.

301
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

302
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,200
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

303
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,360
I believe in us, Steven.

304
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm so happy to hear that.

305
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I know we belong together.

306
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I love you so much.

307
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:25,400
I love you so much.

308
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,840
Okay Erika, so who do you think got shot?

309
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,360
I don't know, but I'm starting to think this story is becoming a soap opera.

310
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,520
Well, it certainly is and well, what do you guys think happened or who do you think got

311
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
shot or?

312
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Who did the shooting?

313
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Who shot who?

314
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Maybe...

315
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Was it even a gunshot?

316
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,880
Maybe it was just the car.

317
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,000
The tire could have popped.

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know.

319
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Exactly.

320
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,160
So well, come to our website, tell us what you think happens or what you would like to

321
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,680
happen because I know many people are expecting a little bit more romance maybe and less drama.
