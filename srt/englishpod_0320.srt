00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,840
My name is Catherine and today we have a special dialogue for you all about this important

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,760
test that you need for going to graduate school.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
That's right.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,600
Today we're going to talk about the famous or very scary GMAT.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,880
Alright so the GMAT, G-M-A-T, is the test that students will take when they want to

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,640
go to graduate school for business management, so an MBA program.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,280
That's right.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,520
It's pretty much a standard test that you have to take, as you say, to get into one

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
of these programs.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,000
Today, we're going to talk a little bit about the sections of the test and more or less

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,040
how it's structured, but not too much in depth.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
That's right.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,520
We'll be back in a moment.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,880
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,120
And I have been here for two years already.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,040
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,920
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,160
An MBA, hey?

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,520
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
The business schools won't be interested in me.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Nonsense.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,960
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
GMAT?

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,780
What does that stand for and what will the test contain?

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,700
Graduate Management Admission Test.

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,200
It contains three parts, analytical writing assessment, the quantitative section, and

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,800
the verbal section.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,640
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,160
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,200
How am I supposed to practice for this?

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,680
Up to you.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,800
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,440
You can also use free or private computer software.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,400
Going to church might help as well.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,960
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
That's the spirit.

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
All right, we're back.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:09,640
So now let's talk about some of the language we found on Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
All right, so there's a lot of great stuff here.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,240
The first one we've got is actually more about a job than school.

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
This is the career ladder.

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,560
That's right, Ash is complaining how he can't seem to make any progress in the career ladder.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,880
So what is a career ladder?

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,960
We know what a ladder is.

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,960
A ladder is a tool that you use to climb from a low place to a high place.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,040
So for example, if you want to go on the roof of your house, you have to use a ladder.

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,000
A career ladder is like an analogy.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,740
When you start a career, you start at the bottom and you climb up, up, up to the top.

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,400
So going from the bottom to maybe the president of an organization.

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,920
So that's called the career ladder.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,520
Yeah, climbing from the bottom of a career area, like for example, being the mailman

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,080
at an office building to being the president of that office.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Okay, so this is what Ash is complaining about, that it's hard or he can't really seem to

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,600
go up the career ladder.

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,460
And so Mindy suggests that he should take the GMAT and go into graduate school.

60
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,400
So as we said, the GMAT is a test that you take, but what does it stand for?

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
What is GMAT?

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,520
GMAT stands for Graduate Management Admission Test.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,920
Okay, so that's the test that you take when you want to go to school.

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,800
So you have to send your scores to the admissions office of the school you want to go to and

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,440
they will decide if they're high enough or not.

66
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Okay, very good.

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,240
So not everyone can go to graduate school and you have to take this test and pass it

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
basically.

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,200
So there's no pass fail, but certain schools will say that a score is high enough and other

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,760
schools will say that a higher score is more important.

71
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,280
So you can maybe go to a better school if you have a better score.

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,640
Okay, and well, Mindy went on to explain the three parts of this test.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,280
The first one she said is analytical writing.

74
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,240
All right, so analytical writing is a very common part of a test.

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,360
For example, I think the SAT also has analytical writing and basically you're asked to read

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,080
something and then write about it.

77
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,300
And analytical means that you have to really use your mind to make an argument.

78
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,760
It's not just read and repeat, read and repeat.

79
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,920
So basically it comes from analyzing.

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,640
You analyze what you read and then you write about it.

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
That's right.

82
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,240
You have to think and you have to understand what you read and then you have to write something

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
that makes sense.

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
It's logical.

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,800
Do you put your opinion in analytical writing?

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
No.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,680
So it's all based on facts.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Based on facts and logic and argument.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Uh-huh, okay.

90
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
So you have this part of analytical writing.

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,320
And then Mindy talks about the quantitative section of the test.

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,980
So what is this?

93
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,200
So the quantitative section, you think of the word quantify, quantity, quantitative

94
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,520
has to do with numbers.

95
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Math, basically.

96
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,320
So you have to be able to understand basic math, some algebra, some arithmetic, some

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
statistics for example.

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,760
So quantitative sections on tests are the math sections.

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,200
Now from my understanding, even though it is a math section, it's not really like they

100
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,240
give you a problem, an equation and you have to solve it.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
It's more like analysis, right?

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
They give you some information and you have to use math to solve it.

103
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
That's right.

104
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
So there are a number of different parts.

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
One of them is like what you say.

106
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,360
It's kind of a, it's about logic while using algebra to solve these problems.

107
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,200
I think the other part of it has to do with statistics and being able to understand trends,

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,920
graphs, things like that.

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
So this is the math section of the exam.

110
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,680
So not only do you have to be able to read, understand and analyze what you're reading,

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
you have to be able to be good at math.

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
And then finally we have a verbal section.

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
What is this all about?

114
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,040
This is about your English language and grammar skills.

115
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,800
So the verbal section will test your vocabulary knowledge.

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Do you understand what big words mean?

117
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,900
Also will test your ability to read passages and analyze them.

118
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,980
So I guess this part is the most important, one of the most important parts for foreign

119
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,880
students who obviously don't speak English as their first language.

120
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,980
This makes sure that you have a good enough English level to be able to take a graduate

121
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,820
program in English, right?

122
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,620
Part of it's that there's a special test that will test your English abilities, but this

123
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,840
is absolutely an important part for a non-native English speaker on the GMAT.

124
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,800
You have to, it's hard for English speakers who were born speaking English, you know,

125
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
natives English speakers.

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Yeah.

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
So it's something that really you should devote your time to if you are a non-native English

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
speaker because there will be some very challenging words there.

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Okay.

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,300
So those are the three sections of the GMAT.

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,900
And so to finish off language takeaway, Ash said that he's going to take this test because

132
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,640
he wants to become a corporate fat cat.

133
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
All right.

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,300
Now this is an interesting term.

135
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,960
This is not something we talk about in the office.

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,400
This is something we talk about with friends.

137
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,680
So corporate fat cat, you think corporate, corporation, this has to do with business.

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,840
So basically we're talking about very important businessmen, but fat cat's not a good thing,

139
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
right?

140
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
No, it's not really.

141
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,400
You refer to a fat cat, a corporate fat cat, as a businessman who you consider to have

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,500
a lot of money, but obviously you make the analogy that they're fat because they have

143
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,640
so much money.

144
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,800
And it's kind of a way of saying that businessmen are not the, corporate fat cats are not the

145
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
best people around.

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,720
No, you're basically saying that these guys, these men on top, they're rich, but they're

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
kind of lazy.

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,080
And so he wants to be a corporate fat cat.

149
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,140
He wants to be very rich and powerful and not have to work so hard.

150
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,920
Which obviously is not really the case always, but this is a common term that, as you said,

151
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,600
you wouldn't really mention it in the office, but it's more of a satirical way of describing

152
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,880
speaking about businessmen.

153
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,800
All right, so now let's finish off language takeaway and move on to some phrases on Fluency

154
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,920
Builder.

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,280
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try.

156
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,480
And I have been here for two years already.

157
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,400
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

158
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,320
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
An MBA, hey?

160
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,920
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

161
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,520
The business schools won't be interested in me.

162
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Nonsense.

163
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,320
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

164
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
GMAT?

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,160
What does that stand for and what will the test contain?

166
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,080
Graduate Management Admission Test.

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,560
It contains three parts, analytical writing assessment, the quantitative section, and

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,200
the verbal section.

169
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,960
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

170
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,560
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

171
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
How am I supposed to practice for this?

172
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
Up to you.

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,200
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

174
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,840
You can also use free or private computer software.

175
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
Going to church might help as well.

176
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,360
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
That's the spirit.

178
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,000
All right, in Fluency Builder today we have a number of really great phrases you can use.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,680
The first one is from Mindy.

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,120
She says, I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

181
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Right.

182
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
She suggests getting an MBA.

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,760
I heard it does wonders to improve your career.

184
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
This is actually something that you might hear in a commercial.

185
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,640
It does wonders means it really helps.

186
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,560
It's really beneficial to you.

187
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
You might hear it in a commercial, for example, with a face cream.

188
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,800
It does wonders to your skin.

189
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,360
It really makes your skin look good.

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,080
By using this phrase, it does wonders, you're basically saying it's fast, it's effective,

191
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,720
it's almost a miracle of how much it can improve your career or in this case of the cream,

192
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
how it can improve your face.

193
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
That's right.

194
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
The MBA does wonders.

195
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,600
It's almost miraculous how positive and effective it will have on your career.

196
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Exactly.

197
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Okay.

198
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It does wonders.

199
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,000
Then Ash was asking how he's supposed to study for this and Mindy answered, well, you know

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
what?

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's up to you.

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You have a lot of options.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
She said, up to you.

204
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Up to you.

205
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,360
This means it's your decision.

206
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,520
We can use this in normal life.

207
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,400
You and I are out, Marco, and I say, well, I don't know what to eat.

208
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
What do you want to eat?

209
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I can say, oh, whatever.

210
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
It's up to you.

211
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Up to me.

212
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,840
That means I get to decide what we eat and I want pizza.

213
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Okay.

214
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Very good.

215
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
All right.

216
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Up to you is a way to say, no, you decide.

217
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
It's up to you.

218
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
It's your decision.

219
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Okay.

220
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,640
For our next phrase, Ash was saying that he's going to study really hard and he's going

221
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,360
to ace the test.

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
All right.

223
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,720
Now, to ace a test, this is a phrase that we use.

224
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,280
We can use it in high school and college as well, not just MBA programs.

225
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,080
To ace a test means to do perfectly on it.

226
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,400
That means to get an A or even 100%.

227
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,200
It's important to remember that we have this grading system, A, B, C, D, F. A is the top.

228
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,440
You ace it means you don't make any mistakes.

229
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Remember that, A for ace.

230
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Okay.

231
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,800
You can even use it if it's not really a test.

232
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,760
Like a job interview, you say, I aced that job interview.

233
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
I ace it.

234
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,360
In sports, oftentimes, we see this tennis.

235
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,440
It's a sports analogy.

236
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,640
Tennis, when someone serves a ball and the other player can't even hit the ball back,

237
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
it's an ace.

238
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
You get a point.

239
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
That's right.

240
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,600
It's an ace for that.

241
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,560
Even good sports athletes, you call them aces.

242
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,760
After a job interview, I can say, wow, Marco, I really aced that interview.

243
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
I aced it.

244
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
That's right.

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,240
Mindy says, well, you know what?

246
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
That's really good.

247
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,520
That's the spirit.

248
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
That's the spirit.

249
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,360
Now, this is something you say to someone when you like their attitude.

250
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,480
If I say, oh man, I did really bad.

251
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
This is stupid.

252
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
I don't want to study.

253
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,960
You say, well, that's a bad attitude.

254
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
If I say, you know what?

255
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm going to do awesome.

256
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
This is great.

257
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I'm going to kill this.

258
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I'm going to ace it.

259
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,800
You can say, that's the spirit.

260
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
That's the spirit.

261
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,880
That means good attitude.

262
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,440
That's the right way to think about this.

263
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,840
So you're kind of even encouraging that person.

264
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
You're saying, you know what?

265
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
I really like your attitude.

266
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,640
That's the good way of thinking.

267
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Exactly.

268
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,200
So if you want to push someone and say, good for you.

269
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,760
This is a good way to approach it.

270
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
You say, that's the spirit.

271
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Okay.

272
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Awesome.

273
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,680
So this is all the language that we have for Fluency Builder.

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:48,760
Why don't we take a break and we'll be right back.

275
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,080
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try.

276
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,400
And I have been here for two years already.

277
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,240
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

278
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

279
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,400
An MBA, hey?

280
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,720
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

281
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,320
The business schools won't be interested in me.

282
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Nonsense.

283
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,200
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

284
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
GMAT?

285
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
What does that stand for?

286
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,000
And what will the test contain?

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,920
Graduate Management Admission Test.

288
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
It contains three parts.

289
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,040
Analytical Writing Assessment, the Quantitative Section, and the Verbal Section.

290
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

291
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,400
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

292
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
How am I supposed to practice for this?

293
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Up to you.

294
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,040
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

295
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,680
You can also use free or private computer software.

296
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Going to church might help as well.

297
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,200
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

298
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,960
That's the spirit.

299
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,240
All right, we're back.

300
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,880
So now talking about the GMAT and an MBA.

301
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,060
This seems to be a very popular topic nowadays.

302
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,280
Everyone wants to get obviously a good education and go to graduate school, which means getting

303
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,400
your master's degree or your doctoral degree.

304
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,520
What do you think about the GMAT and the MBA?

305
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,800
Is it a miracle worker like this girl says she does?

306
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Wow, it does wonders for your career.

307
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
Do you think that's really the case?

308
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,760
I don't know.

309
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,560
Maybe if you asked me five years ago, I would say yes.

310
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,920
But I really believe that it depends on the person.

311
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,160
Nothing is a miracle cure.

312
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,280
I do think that if you really have a good attitude and you work hard, you'll get a lot

313
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
out of it.

314
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,120
But if you think it's going to get you a job, you're wrong because you have to get yourself

315
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
a job.

316
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,400
So I think it depends on the person.

317
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,600
Now obviously also it depends on the country, right?

318
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:56,080
Now how popular or how important is it for people to have, let's say, an MBA to get ahead

319
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,120
in business in the United States?

320
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,560
I'd say it's pretty important.

321
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
You don't have to have an MBA.

322
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
I mean, you can start your own business.

323
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
And if you're successful, you'll probably start more businesses.

324
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,280
But getting an MBA is also a very good opportunity to network, to meet people, to find out more

325
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,120
about the industry that you want to start out in.

326
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,160
And so I think in that sense, it's pretty important because it's a way to start making

327
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
contacts.

328
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,680
Yeah, you definitely meet a lot of people with work experience from different backgrounds,

329
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
international students.

330
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,400
So it's obviously a great thing.

331
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,640
But obviously to be able to do one of these programs, like get an MBA, you have to take

332
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,120
these tests, which I understand are very, very difficult.

333
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,640
They are very difficult and it can be very expensive.

334
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,600
I mean, graduate school itself is $100,000, $200,000.

335
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,560
And then to prepare for the tests, you could spend another $1,000 just getting classes

336
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,760
or tutoring.

337
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,600
So I do think that it can be a lot of money up front.

338
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,360
But there are places that you can go to study and you could even study on your own using

339
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
your computer.

340
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Yeah, exactly.

341
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,920
I think this is a very interesting topic because in many different cultures, in many different

342
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,640
places, education or, for example, higher learning, like getting an MBA, has different

343
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
levels of importance.

344
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,400
Like in Europe, a lot of Europeans maybe don't really even pay too much attention to getting

345
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
an MBA.

346
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,200
Whereas in other countries, they might really emphasize like you have to have an MBA.

347
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
It's really good.

348
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,440
It's really good for your career.

349
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,920
So it's very interesting to see how in different places they handle it.

350
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
It is interesting.

351
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,560
And I'm actually very curious to hear from our users.

352
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,760
Have you ever thought about getting an MBA?

353
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,000
Are MBAs important to do business in your country?

354
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let us know.
