00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine and you've been with us for a little while.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,720
You've probably heard some of our interview series already.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,040
Well this is one of the later episodes in that series.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
That's right.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,040
We're at part number nine.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,720
We're reaching the end of our interview and on this occasion we're going to ask our employer

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,280
a little bit of more information about the company and more importantly about the job.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,200
Well this is a very important step.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,520
Like you say, it's at the end of the interview so we're going to find out more details about

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
the job.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,920
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,160
We'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,600
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,640
For example, how big is your office here?

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,480
head office in Beijing.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,560
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,960
I see.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,480
And how about the working hours?

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,940
Well as you know Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,720
You could be on call at any time but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,600
Well I'm used to that Mr Parsons.

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,480
So that's not really a shock for me.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Good.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
As long as you understand that.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,800
And when do you need to fill the vacancy Mr Parsons?

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,000
Yesterday but no.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,880
We're hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,480
That sounds like deal.

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Alright we're back.

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,400
So it's obviously a very difficult job and she asked some very key questions.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,440
So why don't we take a look at a couple of the words and phrases used there on Language

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,620
Takeaway.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,280
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,680
The first word that we have here for Language Takeaway is workforce.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
That's right a workforce.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,740
The company's workforce.

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
And that basically means all the employees that we have working for us.

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,880
That might not be in one office.

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,240
Many companies have two, three, even a hundred offices.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,280
So the workforce means all the people who work for the company combined.

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
That's right.

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,880
So a workforce.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,680
And well she asked about the workforce and well it's obviously a pretty big company.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,800
150 employees.

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,960
But he also mentioned that the news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 people or

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,420
80 staff.

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:34,940
So this verb to comprise or in this case it comprises means to make up or to account for.

51
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,320
It's a very nice word to say it accounts for, it makes up, it's the total.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,500
It's the total right.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,120
So in this case the news desk staff has 80 people.

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
That's a very easy way to say it.

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,640
But we could say it comprises 80 people.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
It sounds a bit better.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
That's right.

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Very good.

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,720
So now obviously she's going to be a reporter or a journalist and he said that she should

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
be on call at any time.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Okay.

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,120
On call is a phrase that we often hear with jobs like journalism but also medicine.

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,720
So doctors have to be on call very often.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,720
This means that you don't have to be in the office but you have to be available to come

65
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,860
into the office.

66
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,880
So when someone calls you and they say we have an emergency you have to be available.

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
That's right.

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,040
And you see it in movies all the time.

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,120
You know doctors are on call and maybe they're already sleeping or maybe they're out I don't

70
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,680
know playing soccer with their kids and they receive a phone call and they have to go to

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
the hospital in that moment.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
It's because they're on call.

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
That's because they're on call.

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Very good.

75
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
And so obviously this is a very difficult thing for someone.

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,760
And he explains that the work has very unsociable hours at times.

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,800
Okay so you can say that the hours are unsociable.

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,560
You can also say that a person is unsociable.

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,760
It basically means that it's not very convenient for being a social person or for going out

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,200
with friends and having many events to go to or fun things to do in your personal life.

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
That's right.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,320
So if a person is unsociable it means that maybe that person is not very outgoing or

83
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,880
maybe is always angry or grumpy so that person doesn't get along well with others.

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Right.

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,400
So in this case it doesn't mean that it's a grumpy job.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,880
It just means that because she might have to work at night very often or on the weekends

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,920
it's very hard to have a social life.

88
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
That's right.

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,800
Okay so obviously this job is very difficult but in the end she was really happy with it

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,680
and she said that sounds ideal, her starting time.

91
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,920
So something is ideal if it's perfect or great or the top.

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
That's right.

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,280
Many people talk about the ideal job, right?

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
The perfect job.

95
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,720
So that's the job that you have in your mind when you think of what is the best.

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
That's right.

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,240
So maybe my ideal job is different from your ideal job.

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
That's right.

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,920
So you have ideal jobs or your ideal house or your dream house.

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
Your ideal husband.

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
That's right.

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
So ideal, idealism.

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's review what Rebecca and Mr. Parsons talked about and we'll be back in a little

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,120
bit with Fluency Builder.

106
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,560
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,080
For example, how big is your office here?

108
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,520
Well, in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our

109
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,480
head office in Beijing.

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,560
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
I see.

112
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,000
And how about the working hours?

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,920
Well, as you know Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly 9 to 5.

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,360
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

115
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
Well, I'm used to that Mr. Parsons.

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
So that's not really a shock for me.

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Good.

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
As long as you understand that.

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,720
And when do you need to fill the vacancy Mr. Parsons?

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
Yesterday, but no.

121
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,800
We're hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

122
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
That sounds ideal.

123
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
All right, we're back.

124
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,520
So now we have four phrases for you prepared on Fluency Builder.

125
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,840
Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
This first phrase is something that we say all the time in English, but I think a lot

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,640
of learners make mistakes when they use it.

128
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,160
The phrase is how about.

129
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
That's right.

130
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,400
So you see that Rebecca was listening to what Mr. Parsons said and she said, and how about

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
the working hours?

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,400
So this is a way to say, and what are the working hours?

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,360
But basically it's a way to continue the conversation.

134
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,640
You can say this in many different ways, but it basically means, and what about?

135
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,120
Or, please tell me about.

136
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
That's right.

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,480
Now remember that many English learners mistake the phrase how about as if they were saying,

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
how are you?

139
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,360
Or how is it?

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
No.

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
You have to be following someone else in the conversation.

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,040
So for example, I could say, you know what?

143
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,380
I'm going to have a hamburger with bacon.

144
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
How about you Marco?

145
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,720
What are you going to eat?

146
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,040
How about you buy me a cheeseburger?

147
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,640
Okay, so this is basically a way of saying, okay, well maybe I'll have a cheeseburger

148
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,040
or what are you going to have?

149
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,920
So now it's important to say, don't ever make this question.

150
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,360
Don't ever ask, how about your weekend?

151
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
No, no, no, no, no.

152
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,000
How was your weekend?

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
My weekend was great.

155
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,240
How about yours?

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
How about yours?

157
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,800
That's continuing the conversation saying, mine was good.

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
How was yours?

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Yeah.

160
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Okay.

161
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
So what did he say?

162
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
He said that when they were talking about the work hours, he said that the work hours

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
are not exactly nine to five.

164
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,200
Okay, so this is a kind of a set phrase we use often in English because a lot of people

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,200
traditionally have worked from 9am to 5pm.

166
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,160
They have a break at lunch, then they go home.

167
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
That's right.

168
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,880
So this is a kind of measure for, this is a way to describe traditional working hours

169
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,300
or traditional jobs.

170
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,880
So you can say, yeah, I have a really nice nine to five job.

171
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,040
You could say, I really don't want to work a nine to five job.

172
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
That's right.

173
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,760
So you don't want a traditional job where you're working from nine to five.

174
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Right.

175
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,280
Most people I think work a little bit longer than that, but this is just a way of saying

176
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
a traditional job.

177
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
That's right.

178
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay.

179
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Nine to five job.

180
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,240
Now, why don't we move on to Rebecca saying that she is used to working long hours or

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,440
being on call.

182
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Right.

183
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,860
So this construction, to be used to, I'm used to doing this, is a way to say that I already

184
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
do this.

185
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,320
This is my experience or I have the habit of working unusual hours.

186
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
That's right.

187
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,040
So maybe for example, you live in a very noisy area in your neighborhood and somebody comes

188
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,440
and visits you and they can't sleep because it's so noisy.

189
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
You are used to it.

190
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
Oh, you say, Oh, I don't mind.

191
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm used to the noise.

192
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,120
But your friend who's visiting is not used to it.

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Right.

194
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
They don't have this noise at home.

195
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,500
So that's what happens and it can't sleep.

196
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,560
So when you are used to something, you have the habit or you're accustomed to it.

197
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
That's right.

198
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Okay.

199
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
And what about our last phrase?

200
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,920
Our last phrase comes at the end and Rebecca is talking about the start date for this job.

201
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,120
She wants to know, when do you need to fill the vacancy?

202
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Okay.

203
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
To fill the vacancy.

204
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,400
Now, we have this word vacancy and that means that it's available, right?

205
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
That's right.

206
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
So vacancy is an available thing.

207
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,080
It could be a vacant place.

208
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Like an apartment?

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Like an apartment.

210
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,320
In this case, a vacancy in a company.

211
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,440
That means a job that is available.

212
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
That's right.

213
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,160
So she is asking when she can fill the vacancy.

214
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,640
So we use the verb fill, to fill a vacancy.

215
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,840
And this sounds a lot better than saying, Hey, when do I start working here?

216
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,480
This is a polite way to say, when is the job going to begin?

217
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,960
When do you need to fill the vacancy by?

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,400
I guess another way of saying it would be, when is the starting date?

219
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes.

220
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,680
So as we say, also fill the vacancy is a very good option.

221
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
But don't say, when do I start working?

222
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Or when do we start?

223
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,120
Yeah, no, we can talk about that in a minute.

224
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,360
Let's listen first to our dialogue one more time.

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,480
We'll be back shortly.

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,920
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

227
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,520
For example, how big is your office here?

228
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,880
Well, in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong, with another 400 in our

229
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,840
head office in Beijing.

230
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,920
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

231
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
I see.

232
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,400
And how about the working hours?

233
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,300
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly nine to five.

234
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,460
You could be on call at any time.

235
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,760
But we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

236
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,960
Well, I'm used to that, Mr. Parsons.

237
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
So that's not really a shock for me.

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,120
Good, as long as you understand that.

239
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,200
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?

240
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,180
Yesterday, but no, we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

241
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,680
That sounds ideal.

242
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,360
So talking about working hours, being on call or unsociable working hours, have you ever

243
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,360
had a job where you've had to work maybe through the night?

244
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,120
Yes, I used to work in a movie theater when I was in college.

245
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
I had a day job too, so it was kind of a mess.

246
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
I was very unsociable.

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,720
But I worked at a movie theater and I would start working at 6 p.m. or 5 p.m. and I would

248
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,960
work until 2 or 3 a.m.

249
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,960
And so it was always busiest on Friday and Saturday.

250
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,200
And so I could never go out with my friends.

251
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
So while everyone was partying, you were at the movie theater.

252
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Exactly.

253
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,360
Or they would come to the movies and I would sneak in and bring them popcorn.

254
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,120
So these unusual working hours, it's very interesting because usually, although it is

255
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
a little bit more of a sacrifice, they usually pay a little bit better, right?

256
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
They do and there are some advantages.

257
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
It means that you get to sleep in really late.

258
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,800
You don't have to wake up early.

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,320
And you have the day off, like the entire day to do something.

260
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Exactly.

261
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
What about you?

262
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,840
Have you ever worked unusual hours?

263
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
Yes, yes.

264
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,760
I used to work for a newspaper and obviously people like their newspaper in the mornings.

265
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,240
So bright and early.

266
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Bright and early.

267
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
We're talking about 6 a.m.

268
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,040
So obviously, we would deliver the newspapers around 1 a.m., 2 a.m.

269
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,440
From 1 a.m. to about 6 a.m.

270
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Wow.

271
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,240
So yeah, pretty unusual and very difficult because, for example, some people, for them,

272
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
it's great to see the sunrise.

273
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,800
I've seen so many sunrises and it's not really romantic for me anymore.

274
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
We would call you a night owl.

275
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah.

276
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Someone who's more awake at night.

277
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,320
That's right and I still am.

278
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,160
So we're really interested to know maybe if you had any unusual working hours.

279
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,720
Or do you work a 9 to 5?

280
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Yeah, do you have a 9 to 5 job?

281
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,960
So come to our website EnglishPod.com, let us know and we'll see everyone there.

282
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Bye.

283
00:12:43,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Got it.
