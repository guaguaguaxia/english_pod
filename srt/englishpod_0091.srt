00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,220
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,600
And today we're going to be looking at another kind of science fiction lesson related to

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,760
aliens.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
That's right.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,760
And I think in this lesson we'll actually have an alien sighting here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
Right, an alien encounter.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,320
So we're going to be learning about the stars, we're going to be learning about aliens and

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,800
UFOs today.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right, and we're also going to learn some language that you can use to describe

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,860
negative results, things that happen that are bad.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,860
That's right.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,160
So let's start by looking at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,320
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,760
Okay, we have two words for you that we're going to hear in the dialogue.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,560
And the first one is constellation.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Constellation.

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
A constellation.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,560
A constellation.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:18,560
A constellation is a group of stars that makes a shape and has a name.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
The next one is earthlings.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Earthlings.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Earthlings.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,520
So earthlings are people who live on planet Earth.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
On Earth, exactly.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
And in the dialogue we're going to hear greetings earthlings.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,560
This is the most typical phrase that you will hear in almost every single alien movie.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Exactly.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,080
So it's like saying hello people from Earth.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,680
Yes, every single alien in the world says this phrase.

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,160
So those are the two words that we are going to find in this dialogue today.

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:02:01,760
So why don't we start and listen to what happens with our UFO experience.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,400
Oh honey, this is so romantic.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,880
I have never seen like so many stars before.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,360
It's beautiful.

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,400
See that constellation there?

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
That's Orion.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
And the very bright star?

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,320
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,240
It's actually Venus.

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,200
What's that big flashy one?

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,820
I don't know.

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,320
I think it's a UFO.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Greetings earthlings.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I come from afar.

47
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:47,280
From a distant galaxy known only to a few.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you here?

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where did you come from?

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We have been observing you for the last 3000 years.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
or masterpieces such as the Hafner Symphony.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall and we are here to save your

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
planet from you.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You think you have us figured out?

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Who are you?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What are you?

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you?

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are you?

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you?

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you?

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you?

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What are you?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you?

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What are you?

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you?

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What are you?

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you?

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you?

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What are you?

75
00:03:44,100 --> 00:04:10,660
and

76
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,400
the Earth.

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,960
some of the negative results that are happening because of the human's behavior on earth,

78
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
right?

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Right.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,480
And so one of the things they said was that your intelligence and creativity does not

81
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,520
come without consequence.

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,400
Consequence.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Without consequence.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
All right.

85
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,960
So the consequence of an action are basically the results.

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,080
Yes, exactly.

87
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,720
And here the phrase without consequence suggests the negative results.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,720
So the negative results from your actions.

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Very good.

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
What about our next word?

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Well, the aliens also talked about human ambition.

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Ambition.

94
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Ambition.

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
So, what is ambition exactly?

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,000
So ambition is the desire or the want for things to be better, to improve, to get rich,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,280
to be technologically advanced.

98
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay.

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
So to want more.

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Yeah.

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,240
You have ambitions in your life, in your professional life, in your personal life.

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,480
So basically we have ambition and we have desires and these are the reasons for our

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
downfall.

104
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Okay.

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
So downfall.

106
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Downfall.

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,120
Will be your downfall.

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,100
So the downfall of something is?

109
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,640
Something that causes failure.

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Okay.

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,040
So the loss of wealth or the loss of reputation or that it gets ruined.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Exactly.

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
The downfall.

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,880
We can say like for example, the downfall of the Roman empire.

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,000
You know what, this guy is a great employee, but his lack of ambition was his downfall.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Very good.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Coming up to our next word.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,400
The alien described that humans have a belligerent attitude.

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Belligerent.

121
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Belligerent.

122
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Belligerent.

123
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
All right.

124
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
This is a very nice word.

125
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,680
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use it in context?

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,200
Example one.

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Don't take that belligerent tone with me.

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,840
I don't want to argue with you.

129
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,800
Example two.

130
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Thomas is always so belligerent.

131
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,800
It is impossible to talk to him.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,320
Example three.

133
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,960
Stacey was fired for her belligerent attitude.

134
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,600
Okay.

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,560
So I can understand that it means sort of aggressive, having a strong willingness to

136
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
fight.

137
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Exactly.

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,360
A belligerent person, a belligerent attitude, a belligerent country.

139
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Okay.

140
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Very good.

141
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,920
And our last word for today.

142
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Anguish.

143
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Anguish.

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Anguish.

145
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,200
So to cause great anguish.

146
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,520
To cause a lot of terrible emotional or physical pain.

147
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay.

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,160
So it is a synonym of pain, of suffering.

149
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Yeah.

150
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
But really intense suffering.

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Really intense.

152
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Why don't we give a few examples?

153
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,160
The end of his marriage caused him great anguish.

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,600
Or for example, the loss of his dog caused him great anguish.

155
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Okay.

156
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
So anguish.

157
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Alright.

158
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,760
So we've covered five great words on Language Takeaway today.

159
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,120
Why don't we move on now to putting it together?

160
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Putting it together.

161
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
Okay.

162
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,480
We're going to look at three phrases that we heard in the dialogue and see how we can

163
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,440
use them in different contexts.

164
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,560
So the aliens were praising some of the masterpieces that the humans have created, right?

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Right.

166
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,840
He said, you humans create such wonders as the Taj Mahal, blah, blah, blah.

167
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Okay.

168
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
So let's look at this phrase, such wonders as.

169
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Alright.

170
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,560
So we have a noun here, a wonder.

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,600
An amazing thing.

172
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
An amazing structure.

173
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Yes.

174
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,480
He says such wonders as.

175
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,960
Now we can change this noun and replace it with another one, right?

176
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah.

177
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,640
We can replace that noun with anything.

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,560
So why don't we hear a few examples?

179
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,200
Example one.

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,280
To finish this house, we need such materials as cement, wood, and steel.

181
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,480
Example two.

182
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:33,320
I need to write a report on a social topic such as psychology, health, or marriage.

183
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,840
Example three.

184
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,920
Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great

185
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,400
marketing opportunities.

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,280
So this is a really useful structure to use when you want to give examples of many different

187
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
things.

188
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Okay.

189
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,480
So when a civilian was criticizing the humans, the guy said, what gives you the right to

190
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,040
come and judge us?

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,400
So interesting phrase.

192
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,320
What gives you the right?

193
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,920
What gives you the right?

194
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
What gives you the right?

195
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
All right.

196
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,400
So if I tell you what gives you the right to, and then a verb.

197
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah.

198
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
What am I saying there?

199
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,160
You're basically saying you don't have the right to do this.

200
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
You shouldn't do this.

201
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,160
Why are you doing it?

202
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,080
Or why do you want to have this control over me?

203
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Yep.

204
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
So when would you use this phrase?

205
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,480
If somebody is trying to control you or maybe somebody is judging you or doing something

206
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,760
to you against your will, maybe, you would say, what gives you the right to take my phone

207
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
away?

208
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
What gives you the right to tell me what to do?

209
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,840
All right.

210
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,640
It's a good phrase to tell that other person that they shouldn't do that.

211
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
They're doing something unfair.

212
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Unfair.

213
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Okay.

214
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,040
And our next phrase is very similar.

215
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,160
Who are you to play God with our fate?

216
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Okay.

217
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,360
So I want to look at this.

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
To play God.

219
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
All right.

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
So to play God is making these arbitrary decisions.

221
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,120
Like he is the master of everything.

222
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Right.

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Controlling everything.

224
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,320
But this phrase, who are you to?

225
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,480
So basically saying you don't have the power or authority to do this.

226
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,760
And you can use it in exactly the same way.

227
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,680
Who are you to tell me what to do?

228
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,040
Who are you to take away my phone?

229
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Exactly.

230
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,840
So you don't have the power to do this.

231
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Very good.

232
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,280
So these phrases are a little bit aggressive, almost belligerent, wouldn't you say?

233
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,400
A little bit.

234
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,600
But I guess if you are being treated unfair or if you are angry at a situation, it would

235
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,920
be a good phrase to use to put your point across.

236
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Yes.

237
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,360
And as we saw, these humans are pretty angry.

238
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,640
So why don't we listen again as they're telling the aliens, who are you to do this to us?

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:11:00,320
Oh, honey, this is so romantic.

240
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,800
I have never seen like so many stars before.

241
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,280
It's beautiful.

242
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
See that constellation there?

243
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
That's Orion.

244
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
And the very bright star?

245
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,200
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
That's actually Venus.

247
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,120
What's that big, flashy one?

248
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,760
I don't know.

249
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,160
I think it's a UFO.

250
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Greetings, Earthlings.

251
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:42,200
I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

252
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
Why are you here?

253
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,760
Where did you come from?

254
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,720
We have been observing you for the last three thousand years.

255
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,440
We have seen your amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal

256
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,440
or masterpieces such as the Hafner Symphony.

257
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,640
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

258
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,080
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to save your

259
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,360
planet from you.

260
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,240
You think you have us figured out?

261
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,800
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

262
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,160
Who are you to play God with our fate?

263
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Silence, human.

264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,160
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

265
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:45,360
Now you will pay the price.

266
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Okay so UFOs and constellations and stars and planets.

267
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Have you ever had an encounter with one of these?

268
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,560
Well definitely not an encounter with a UFO but maybe with some of the wonders of the

269
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
night sky.

270
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
What happened?

271
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,160
Well you know when I was small I used to have my vacations up in northern Canada and because

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,000
it was so far away from the city it was really dark and you could see all of these shooting

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,920
stars so these stars moving across the sky and lighting up the whole sky with their brightness

274
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,460
and it really is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

275
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,680
So shooting stars those are like balls of fire that move across the sky right?

276
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,960
Yeah exactly and I saw once actually I was in an astronomy class and turned around and

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,840
over the horizon like at the end of the sky where the sky meets the earth I saw this huge

278
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,880
ball of fire move across the sky and it looked like it landed in the field next to us it

279
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
was so close.

280
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Wow that's nice.

281
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,440
Yeah pretty amazing.

282
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Well I imagine that it is really amazing and I guess Canada is the place to be when you

283
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,400
want to see these things.

284
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,240
I know we've got like northern lights, we've got shooting stars, lots of stuff.

285
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,280
Alright so what about you guys?

286
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,920

287
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,440
of astronomy things right?

288
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,760
