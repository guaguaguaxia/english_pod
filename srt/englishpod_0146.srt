00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Hello everyone and welcome back to another edition here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,920
And my name is Catherine and today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
you all about animal and human rights.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
Right.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,800
So it's a very debatable topic.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,480
People want to protect animals, mistreatment of animals.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,640
And this is what we're going to talk about today, protecting animals and giving them

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
rights.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Do you think animals have rights?

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,000
Eh, well, you know, I think we could leave that for the end.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,480
I don't want to, you know, influence the argument here in today's dialogue.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,240
But yeah, as you've said, I think it's very much a topic that people can go both ways

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,400
on.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,420
So why don't we listen to our dialogue as two people discuss animal rights and let's

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:55,320
get their opinions on things.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,040
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,600
The topic it covered was really interesting.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Animal rights.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
Do you really believe in that?

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,760
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,200
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless and are completely at the mercy

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
of human beings.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,240
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,900
more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,840
You can't compare apples and oranges.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,480
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,040
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,440
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,880
Well, you are right on that point.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,120
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,720
At least you're doing your part.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,800
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,160
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,640
All right, we're back and both of them have good points, right?

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,600
In favor and against.

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,760
As you said, they also talk about human rights, which is also a very important topic.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,080
But before we discuss this topic, why don't we take a look at the language that was used

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
now in Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,360
All right, so in Language Takeaway, our first word today is vulnerable.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,480
Okay, vulnerable is a great word.

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,920
It's a way to describe something.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,720
And so something is vulnerable if it can't really protect itself.

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,040
So you are in danger of being hurt.

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Exactly.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Right.

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
So you're vulnerable.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,400
Now, this isn't only used for animals, right?

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,800
It can be like an army is vulnerable if they don't have strong defenses on the borders.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,960
Or my emotions.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,720
I'm feeling vulnerable because I just had a really horrible week and I'm really depressed

54
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,640
and I'm emotionally vulnerable.

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,920
Okay, very good.

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,840
So vulnerable.

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,000
And they also talked about transgressions against human rights.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,960
All right, so a transgression is a thing.

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
It's a noun.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,320
And transgression is like doing something harmful to or against someone or something.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,020
So a transgression, it's a noun.

62
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,480
So is it doing something in a bad way?

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
Exactly.

64
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
It's a bad thing.

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
It's always negative.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
It's not positive, right?

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Right.

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,160
And so in many prayers, for example, in the Christian faith, you say, you know, Lord,

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,200
forgive me for my transgressions, for having kind of crossed the line from doing good things

70
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
to bad things.

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
So you're doing bad things.

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Very good.

73
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,960
So that's a good way of putting it, to cross the line, to kind of go beyond where you should.

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,320
All right, so transgressions.

75
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,560
And now another very serious problem in the world is poaching.

76
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,680
That's one of the things that they said they should control, poaching.

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,120
You might have heard this word in a different context because it does have another meaning,

78
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,440
but I'm just going to explain the one meaning here that we're talking about, which is killing

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,520
animals, especially for sport or for selling their skins and their furs.

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Right.

81
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
So that's poaching.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,680
What's the difference between poaching and hunting?

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Hunting can be legal.

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Poaching is illegal.

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Okay.

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
So that's the main difference.

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,880
Hunting is usually for sport.

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,800
You hunt either for food or for sport, right?

89
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,920
Legal hunting.

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,840
But poaching is usually you want to sell, like you said, the fur or the skins or something.

91
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,680
Or the tusks on rhinos or something like that.

92
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Exactly.

93
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
All right, so poaching.

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,160
And then they talked about synthetic products.

95
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,280
So what is a synthetic product?

96
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,740
Well, synthetic product is something that is man-made.

97
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,560
So it's not natural in that it doesn't come from the earth.

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:36,080
Cotton is a natural product and plastic, for example, is synthetic or another example.

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Or nylon.

100
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480
Nylon is a really good synthetic product.

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,960
And so people who don't want to use animal products like wool or leather, they prefer

102
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
to use synthetic products.

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,380
And I think maybe you've heard this in clothing.

104
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,040
It's called synthetic fibers, right?

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,760
Like nylon or polyester.

106
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Exactly.

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,140
These are all the words that we have for language takeaway today.

108
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,680
So why don't we move on now to a couple of very interesting phrases that we saw in the

109
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,480
dialogue now in Fluency Builder.

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Fluency Builder.

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Okay, this first phrase is, well, it's a common one, but it's definitely not used in very

112
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,960
happy circumstances.

113
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,440
We say that something or someone is at the mercy of someone else.

114
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,400
Okay, so animals are at the mercy of human beings.

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
What does this mean exactly?

116
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Mercy?

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,880
So basically, it means that the animals, in this case, don't have control of what's going

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
on.

119
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,680
So human beings are the ones that control everything.

120
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,720
So if I decide to kill them, then they are at my mercy, at my will, at my whim.

121
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Exactly.

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,840
And so you could say, I'm at your mercy, Marco, please just like help me out with this.

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,160
It's like you're the one in control.

124
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,320
You're the one who can help the situation.

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Will you help?

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Exactly.

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm at the mercy of someone.

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,320
And then they were talking and debating this thing and an interesting comparison came up.

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,640
You can't compare apples and oranges.

130
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,440
All right, you're going to hear this all the time in English.

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,480
It's not just a funny little phrase that the person uses.

132
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
It's a very common idiom.

133
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,440
And so we say, it's like apples and oranges or you can't compare apples and oranges.

134
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,880
And this is essentially saying, these are two different things.

135
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Completely different.

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Completely different.

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,320
So I can't compare him and her because it's apples and oranges.

138
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
They're two different things, two different people.

139
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Right.

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,760
Because that's what in the movie, you said they were like peas and carrots.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
They just go together well.

142
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
They just go together.

143
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Does that make sense?

144
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Not really.

145
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,360
Forrest Gump was a little bit strange like that.

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,000
But I think the meaning is that if I say that's a big apple and I say that's a small

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
apple, they're all apples so I can compare them.

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
But I say this is a really big orange and that's a really big apple.

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,880
Well, they're different.

150
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
You just can't compare them.

151
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
All right.

152
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,360
And towards the end, the person said that you're doing your part.

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
You're doing your part.

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,960
Yeah, so this is a hard one to understand sometimes because it's not like a part in

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
a play.

156
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,280
It's more like a part in society.

157
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,080
You're helping make society or culture or civilization better.

158
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
So you're contributing.

159
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Exactly.

160
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,640
So for example, what would be an example of a person doing their part towards society?

161
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,200
Well, for example, I don't own a car.

162
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,440
I ride my bike and it's my way of doing my part to help the environment.

163
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay, very good.

164
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,520
So I can't, obviously, I can't buy a factory that's very green or I can't do all these

165
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
things to change the world.

166
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,640
So I'm going to do small things that those are my way of doing my part.

167
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Okay.

168
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,440
So like another example would be recycling.

169
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
That's doing your part.

170
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Exactly.

171
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,080
Or in this case, the person bought only synthetic products, nothing made from nature.

172
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
All right, very good.

173
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,200
So very interesting phrases.

174
00:07:51,200 --> 00:08:02,600
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll be right back.

175
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,320
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

176
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,880
The topic it covered was really interesting.

177
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Animal rights.

178
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,240
Do you really believe in that?

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,040
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

180
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,480
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy

181
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
of human beings.

182
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,120
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

183
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,560
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate

184
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,200
more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,160
You can't compare apples and oranges.

186
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,800
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.

187
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,360
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,760
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

189
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,200
Well, you are right on that point.

190
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,440
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

191
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,040
At least you're doing your part.

192
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,120
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,440
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.

194
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,040
All right, so a debatable topic, animals and animal rights.

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
What do you think?

196
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,440
Well, I'll say this.

197
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,600
I would be a hypocrite if I said that it's bad to hurt animals because I'm a meat eater.

198
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,520
I like to eat meat and I like to wear leather.

199
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,240
But I do think it's bad to mistreat animals.

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,120
So I try to buy free-range chicken or meat from places I know that treat the animals

201
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,040
well and I definitely disagree with poaching and with using animals, especially endangered

202
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,880
animals for money and cash purposes.

203
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,520
And so that's my position.

204
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
But what's yours?

205
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,080
I mean, I know you eat meat too.

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
No, yeah, of course.

207
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,720
And I think even though protection of animals is a very important topic and you don't want

208
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,480
the mistreatment of these little creatures that are very vulnerable to us because we're

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,240
smarter than them in the end.

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,760
But I think also it has to do a lot with superstition sometimes and kind of mystical and magical

211
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
things.

212
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,520
For example, people killing rhinos because they believe that the rhino horn has amazing

213
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,360
curing properties or the same thing with elephant tusks and stuff like that.

214
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,920
So it also involves this certain aspect that people almost don't know any better.

215
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,760
They just truly believe that these things actually work or that they will help them.

216
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,680
So they don't consider the, like in the dialogue said, the imbalance that they create in the

217
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,400
environment or the consequences.

218
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,960
Or there might be some very serious evolutionary consequences that we cannot even imagine.

219
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,200
And so, you know, things change kind of over time, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly.

220
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,640
But if we force change really quickly, who knows what the results are going to be.

221
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
It might be really negative for us.

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Exactly.

223
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,320
And that's what we want to know now.

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,240
What do you think about these topics?

225
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
Because in the end, the environment, animals, they're all connected.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,040
If you wipe out all the foxes in a forest, then you're going to have too many snakes

227
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,360
running around, right?

228
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,600
So what do you think?

Bye.
