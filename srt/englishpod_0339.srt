00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a very, well, it's a pretty important part of your child's education.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right. Something that many schools do is they have a conference between the teacher and the parent.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, you know, they can talk about how the child is doing.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right. So this is something very common in American schools and it's important to learn some of the words that you will hear.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's take a listen to our dialogue and when we come back we'll be talking about what some of these words and phrases mean.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr. Weber.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As a teacher, it's great seeing the kids' parents assist our parent-teacher conference tonight.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Of course. I'm very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, Alan is a great student. He's a hard worker and very well behaved.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
However, he does struggle a bit with math.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I guess he gets that from me. I never did well in math when I was a kid.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions. It will really help a lot.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thanks a lot. I will definitely do that. Is there anything else?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Um, yes. Here's a notice from our financial department. Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, yes. I...

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
All right, we're back. So now let's take a look at some language takeaway.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Language takeaway.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
First up in language takeaway, we have the key phrase here, which is parent-teacher conference.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right. So it's a parent-teacher conference, a parent-teacher conference.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And it's basically a meeting between the parent of the child and the teacher of the child.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And they talk about how well he is doing or she is doing or what she needs or he needs to improve.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right. So this is something that can happen maybe twice a year, maybe four times a year.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It depends on the school, but it's just a meeting between the parents or parent of the child and his or her teacher.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right. So it's very common with schools in order to make sure that the parent knows how the child is doing in school and can improve maybe.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And one of the goals is to provide the parent with insight into how to help the child learn more.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OK. So insight is kind of like a better understanding of things.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
More clear picture. Yeah. So I could say, you know what, Marco, I just don't get that woman, Cindy.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Can you provide some insight into why she made that decision?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right. So you want some more information or some type of explanation as to why she made that decision.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Exactly. And so the teacher will then provide this insight by describing what he or she thinks about the student.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right. And while the teacher went on to say that Alan is a great student, hard worker, very well behaved.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So he is a hard worker. That means he is this is not an address.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is now he is a hard worker. She is a hard worker. He is very well behaved.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now, this is a way to describe him. He is not naughty. He is well behaved.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That means he doesn't start fights. He doesn't talk in class. He doesn't cheat.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK, so what would be the opposite? You say a child or a person is well behaved. What would be the opposite?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I would say the the child who is not well behaved is naughty.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
OK, so you say he is not well behaved or just he is naughty.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He's very naughty. He always starts fights in class.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OK, now the student is having a little bit of problems with math.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And so the parent asks what he can do to complement what he is learning in the classroom.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
OK, so to complement, you might have heard this verb before, but here it means something special.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It means to add to. All right. So, OK, the boy, Alan, he's learning a lot in school,

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but maybe he's not learning enough because his math scores just aren't good enough.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So the father wants to know what can he do in addition to school.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right. You know, what can he do extra to help his boy so that will it will complement his studies.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right. So we have to complement someone as to say, oh, you look nice today

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
or this in this situation, this verb we are saying to provide more support or extra help to something.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right. So I feel really good about accounting, but I want to take an extra math class

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to complement my accounting studies because I'm just not very confident in my math.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Very good. Exactly. All right. So and towards the end, well, we're talking about how the child's tuition is overdue.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The teacher says the child's tuition is overdue. What is tuition, Marco?

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, the tuition is the fees that you have to pay for school.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
OK, so maybe a private school will have a tuition. So a high school or an elementary school.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But you often hear this in regards to college or university. So college tuitions in America are very expensive.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right. And when a tuition is overdue, it means that it hasn't been paid yet.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And so the payment is late. The payment is late. Now, a lot of things can be overdue.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That means they've passed their due date. A bill can be overdue.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right. So you should have paid your bill already, but you haven't. So it's overdue.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OK, so a lot of vocab there. Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr. Weber. As a teacher, it's great seeing the kids' parents

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
assist our parent-teacher conference night.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Of course. I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, Alan is a great student. He's a hard worker and very well behaved. However, he does struggle a bit with math.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I guess he gets that from me. I never did well in math when I was a kid.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions. It will really help a lot.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thanks a lot. I will definitely do that. Is there anything else?

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Um, yes. Here's a notice from our financial department. Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, yes.

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I...

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Alright, we're back. So now we've prepared three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Fluency Builder

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Alright, the first phrase here on Fluency Builder is to struggle with. So, Alan is a great student, but he does struggle with math.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's right. So, to struggle with something means that you are having a hard time. It's difficult for you.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It is difficult. So, when I was a student in elementary school, I struggled with science. Is there anything you struggled with, Marco?

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I struggled with... I struggled a little bit with history.

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Interesting. So, for Marco, history was hard. For me, science was hard.

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But you can also use it for your work, right? You can say, I'm struggling a little bit at work.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm struggling with my new schedule. I have too much to do.

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay. So, after the teacher said that Alan is struggling with math, the parent actually said, I guess he gets that from me.

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I never did well in math when I was a kid. So, what is the parent saying?

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He gets that from me or she gets that from me. This means that the child has the same problems the parent has.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, when the parent was little, he had a hard time with math. He struggled with math.

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And now his child struggles with math. So, it's something that maybe he inherited or he got from his father.

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He gets that from me.

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right. So, sometimes you will hear that maybe somebody is stubborn and you say, well, you know, I get that from my dad.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes. I'm very talkative. I get that from my mother. That means my mother is talkative and I have the same characteristic.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, we're basically saying that you kind of genetically inherit the same characteristics.

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Exactly.

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right. And the teacher said that, well, in order to improve, Alan should attend tutoring sessions.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Tutoring sessions. Now, this is important. You might have heard the word tutor before.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have a math tutor. But a tutoring session is actually the time you spend together with your tutor practicing something or studying something.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right. So, you don't have a class with your tutor. You have a tutoring session.

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's right. Class is for a teacher and many students. But a tutoring session is one-on-one.

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's two people together, a tutor and a student, a learner.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, the word tutor can be a noun. You have a tutor, which is a person that helps you or you can tutor someone.

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
To tutor, which means to teach or to help.

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's right. So, in college, I had a tutoring session with a math tutor two times a week.

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That means my math tutor helped me learn math outside of school, after school.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Very good. Alright. So, a lot of great stuff there. Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr. Weber. As a teacher, it's great seeing the kids' parents assist our parent-teacher conference tonight.

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Of course. I'm very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, Alan is a great student. He's a hard worker and very well behaved. However, he does struggle a bit with math.

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I guess he gets that from me. I never did well in math when I was a kid.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

112
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions. It will really help a lot.

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thanks a lot. I will definitely do that. Is there anything else?

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Um, yes. Here's a notice from our financial department. Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

116
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, yes. I...

117
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Alright. So, parent-teacher conferences, a very common thing. A very common thing.

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And I think sometimes even a little bit scary for the kid because, you know, your parent is going to go talk to your teacher

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and maybe your teacher is not going to say great things about you.

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, this is always very nerve-wracking for children because maybe you didn't tell your mom and dad

121
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
what you got on your test in science last week and then your teacher will tell your parents and your parents will be angry.

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Right.

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, this is the time when the parents can be honest with the teacher and the teacher can be honest with the parents.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right because sometimes teachers will have a file with maybe your test scores and they will show them to your parents.

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So, not only what you get on your report card but then you actually see the tests and it could be like you say a little nerve-wracking.

126
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I've also heard though it can be nerve-wracking for the teacher because sometimes teachers have to tell parents things

127
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that they don't really want to know about their kids.

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right.

129
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If the teacher says, hey, your boy Alan, he's not very good at math, maybe Alan's dad gets angry.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Right.

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And says, yo, no, that's not true. He's very good at math.

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Right, right.

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So, it can be hard for everyone but I think generally they're very positive. They really help the students.

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, it's interesting and actually I haven't really seen parent-teacher conferences to be that common outside of the United States.

136
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, maybe if you're a parent, you have attended a parent-teacher conference or maybe when you were a kid, your parents went to your parent-teacher conference.

137
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And if you don't have teacher conference, parent-teacher conferences in your country, what do you have?

138
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How do parents and teachers talk?

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let us know. Our website is EnglishPod.com.

140
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
All right. We'll see you guys there.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Bye.
