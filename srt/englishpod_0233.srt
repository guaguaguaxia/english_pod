00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,040
My name is Kathryn and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,680
about money.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
That's right.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,880
We are trading money.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,600
We're actually negotiating in this very popular topic nowadays, the whole foreign exchange

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,600
market.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,680
Okay, so we're talking about currency, which is the money of different countries.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,800
For example, the currency of Ecuador is?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
The US dollar.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Hard to believe, but true.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
What?

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I'll tell you.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I'll tell you all about it later.

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Okay.

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
Well, the currency of America is also the US dollar.

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,800
So with that in mind, let's listen to today's dialogue.

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,040
Hey, John.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,160
I haven't seen you in ages.

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
What's new?

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,440
What have you been up to?

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
Pete, nice to see you.

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,520
Well, on top of the norm, you know, life and kids and work, I've actually gotten into

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,400
doing some trading.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,480
Trading?

28
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
You a big guy?

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,200
What are you trading?

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Currencies.

31
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Currencies?

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,840
As in euros, dollars, pounds and rupees?

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
It's called Forex, foreign exchange.

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,040
The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount.

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,840
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,760
I don't understand.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,720
You're buying and selling money?

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,880
You got it.

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,000
Just last night, I made 150 US dollars.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Last night?

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's a poor market.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
I bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price, but last night it appreciated drastically.

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,840
So I made a split second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,680
I've also done some trading with Swiss francs and Australian dollars and Hong Kong dollars.

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,400
I've made some good profits, but I've also suffered some losses.

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,040
It depends on a lot of factors, just like any other market.

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,760
In total, I've made about 500 US dollars in the past few months.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,920
You're kidding.

50
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm on.

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
I'm going to sign up.

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,440
Alright, we're back.

53
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,640
So this guy is trading currencies as we heard.

54
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,640
And well, we're going to talk about a lot of the specific vocab that he used about this

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
topic.

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,240
So why don't we take a look at some of those now in Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,360
Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,520
Well, the first thing I think we should talk about is, one of the first things that he

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,880
says actually, Peter says, I haven't seen you in ages.

60
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,560
I haven't seen you in ages.

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Right.

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,600
So obviously he hasn't seen him in a long time and that's what in ages means.

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
That's right.

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
So we haven't seen each other in ages.

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,920
So what other ways can we use in ages or the word ages?

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,460
Well you could actually say, it's been ages.

67
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,120
So that means it's been a long time.

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,080
It's been a long time or we haven't gone out for ages.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,600
Okay, so then you can use it with for, for ages.

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,640
For ages, in ages.

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,600
So the key word here is ages which means a long time.

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Long time.

73
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Okay.

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,120
And well, he hasn't seen him in ages and the guy is like, well, you know what?

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,140
I've actually gone into trading.

76
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,040
So that means he started doing some trading.

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Right.

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,120
Now trading is a very broad word because you can trade as in this case, currencies which

79
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
is basically to buy and sell currencies.

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,400
But you could also trade stocks, right?

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You can trade stocks or even people that are involved in import export.

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
They are involved in trading.

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,160
Trading so basically trading is buying and selling something.

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Right.

85
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
So you're trading.

86
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,480
You are exchanging a product for money or money for a product.

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,360
But the difference is you're not actually making any products.

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Right.

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Okay.

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
So that's, that's called trading.

91
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,840
You're not really manufacturing anything.

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,480
You're just exchanging goods and services and money.

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,560
All right.

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,280
So that's for trading.

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,920
Now moving on, he was explaining how the foreign exchange market works and he says, I don't

96
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,680
have to invest a huge amount.

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,640
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

98
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
So Marco, here's the question.

99
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
What is a margin deposit?

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,200
Because a deposit is basically money that you put, invest somewhere or that you pay

101
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
in.

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Right.

103
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,780
Well, basically a margin deposit is like a percentage.

104
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,960
So he basically puts in a percentage of what he intends to buy.

105
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,840
So for example, a margin deposit of a thousand dollars might be $1 or $10.

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Okay.

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,640
So maybe if it's $10, you're talking about a 1% margin.

108
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
Exactly.

109
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,880
So that's what he means by a margin deposit.

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,080
And that's why he explains that you don't have to have a large amount of money in order

111
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,400
to trade in the foreign exchange market.

112
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,960
You just put in a margin deposit and then you can work around that.

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,800
Well, it sounds pretty easy, but then he explains some more details about it and it gets to

114
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
be a little bit more complicated.

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
That's right.

116
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,120
He explained about how he makes money and how he bought some Chinese renminbi and then

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,360
he sold it because it appreciated drastically.

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,940
So he bought it when it was cheap and he sold it when it was expensive.

119
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,480
So the price changed.

120
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Right.

121
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,440
So when you see this kind of price change, when something goes from cheap to expensive,

122
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
it's called appreciating.

123
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Appreciation.

124
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,680
So the verb is to appreciate.

125
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,800
It's very different from using it in the sense of you appreciate someone, right?

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,280
Like I really appreciate you.

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah, no, it's very different.

128
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,360
We could say this about most goods or investments.

129
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,080
For example, my parents bought a house in 1970 and the value of the house has really

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
appreciated over the last 40 years.

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,560
So now the value is much, much greater.

132
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,800
And actually just mentioning it while we're on the topic, to appreciate, as you say, is

133
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
something becomes more expensive.

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,040
The opposite when something becomes cheaper or maybe the value goes down is to depreciate.

135
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,400
Depreciate.

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,120
So that D at the beginning means it's going down.

137
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Right.

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Okay.

139
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,240
And moving on to our last word for language takeaway.

140
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,240
So when he was talking about selling the Chinese currency, he said that he sold it at an amazing

141
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
bid.

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,520
Okay, let's talk about bid here.

143
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
B-I-D.

144
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Bid.

145
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
What does this mean?

146
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
So to bid is to place an offer for something.

147
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Okay.

148
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,760
So for example, at an auction, when someone is selling many old objects or some art, I

149
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,520
can bid $100.

150
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,200
And maybe someone doesn't accept my bid.

151
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,000
But if they do accept my bid, then I pay for it.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Right.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,280
So basically a bid is just another way of saying an offer.

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,640
You're offering a certain amount of money for that product or that service.

155
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,160
And you see it a lot, for example, on eBay, right?

156
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
That's right.

157
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
So eBay is an auction website basically.

158
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,080
And someone who's selling something, someone can see many, many bids and they select the

159
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
best bid.

160
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Exactly.

161
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
So that's what a bid is.

162
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
So that's all we have for language takeaway.

163
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,280
Let's move on now to fluency builder.

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Fluency builder.

165
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,680
Marco, what have you been up to lately?

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,960
I never see you.

167
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Right.

168
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,400
This is actually a very common sentence.

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
What have you been up to?

170
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,560
But most English learners don't really understand what it means.

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,780
Well, this is a really interesting point because I say this all the time.

172
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,560
This is very native, very colloquial.

173
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,520
What have you been up to?

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
It's almost the same as saying what's up.

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
What's up?

176
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,960
Or where have you been recently?

177
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,560
What have you been doing recently?

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
How's your life?

179
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Right.

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,760
So this part, up to, what have you been up to?

181
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,160
It doesn't really say much if you translate it literally.

182
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,940
But basically it's what have you been doing?

183
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,660
What have you been spending your time on?

184
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,720
So to be up to means to do something, to do.

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Right.

186
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,940
And there are many other definitions of up to, but in this case, what have you been up

187
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
to means that.

188
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
What have you been doing?

189
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,560
So the next time you see a friend you haven't seen in a week or two, you can say, what have

190
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,080
you been up to?

191
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,960
All right.

192
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,240
And John answers, well, you know, on top of the norm, wife, kids, and work.

193
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,520
That phrase right there, on top of the norm.

194
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
Well, the norm here means the normal.

195
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,920
That means basically normal life.

196
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,880
I've been working.

197
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,960
I've got my kids, my wife, on top of the norm.

198
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,200
Just life is normal.

199
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Right.

200
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,320
So the norm are the wife, kids, and work.

201
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,440
On top of that, I'm actually gotten into trading.

202
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Right.

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,680
So the normal situation, the normal life is wife, kids, and work.

204
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,880
And then he's saying on top of that, I've actually been doing this.

205
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Exactly.

206
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay.

207
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:45,640
And now moving on to when he's explaining again, the market and the currencies, he talked

208
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,520
about an asking price.

209
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Okay.

210
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,560
Asking price.

211
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,200
This is, remember we were talking about bids.

212
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,360
We could say that someone has an asking price, which is the price they would like to receive

213
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,800
for an object or a service that they are selling.

214
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
And so for example, I'm going to sell my desk.

215
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,920
My asking price is a hundred bucks, a hundred dollars.

216
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,080
Maybe you don't want to pay that much, but my asking price is the way that I'm going

217
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
to start.

218
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
That's how much I want for it.

219
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Right.

220
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
So that's your asking price.

221
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,960
That's how much you ideally want to sell it for, but you can negotiate.

222
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,640
You are willing to accept maybe a lower offer.

223
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Exactly.

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Okay.

225
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,160
And what is our last phrase?

226
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
A split second decision.

227
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,480
This is really, really important.

228
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
These words go together very often.

229
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,240
Split second and decision.

230
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Okay.

231
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,160
So that basically means that you made a very quick decision.

232
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
That's right.

233
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Split second.

234
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Very fast.

235
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,120
It's almost like it's less than a second.

236
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,640
And so a split second decision means a decision in no time.

237
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
It's very, very quick.

238
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,120
So we can actually mix split second with other things, right?

239
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
For example.

240
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,880
Maybe you can say he reacted in a split second and avoided the crash.

241
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Okay.

242
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
So good for him.

243
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,960
He reacted quickly enough to avoid the accident.

244
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
That's right.

245
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,120
So split second, very fast, very quickly.

246
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,640
A split second decision, a decision that was made very fast.

247
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Okay.

248
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
So that's all we have for Fluency Builder.

249
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,200
Why don't we go back, listen to this dialogue one more time and we'll be back to talk a

250
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,440
little bit more.

251
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,360
Hey John, I haven't seen you in ages.

252
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
What's new?

253
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,640
What have you been up to?

254
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,520
Pete, nice to see you.

255
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,680
Well, on top of the norm, you know, life and kids and work, I've actually gotten into

256
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
doing some trading.

257
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
Trading?

258
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
You big guy?

259
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
What are you trading?

260
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Currencies.

261
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Currencies?

262
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
As in euros, dollars, pounds and rupees?

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
It's called Forex, foreign exchange.

264
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,520
The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount.

265
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,000
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,920
I don't understand.

267
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,880
You're buying and selling money?

268
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,040
You got it.

269
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,160
Just last night I made $150 US.

270
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Last night?

271
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Yeah.

272
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
It's a 24 hour market.

273
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,880
I'd bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price, but last night it appreciated drastically.

274
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,040
So I made a split second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

275
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,880
I've also done some trading with Swiss francs and Australian dollars and Hong Kong dollars.

276
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,560
I've made some good profits, but I've also suffered some losses.

277
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,240
It depends on a lot of factors, just like any other market.

278
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,960
In total I've made about $500 US in the past few months.

279
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,100
You're kidding!

280
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
I'm on.

281
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm going to sign up.

282
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,880
So Marco, you have to explain this to me.

283
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
We're talking about currency today.

284
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,320
So every nation has a currency.

285
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,440
For example, in the dialogue we learned that India has rupees.

286
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
Pounds are in Britain.

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,680
Britain has pounds and Australia has Australian dollars.

288
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
America has American dollars.

289
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,560
But you just said earlier that Ecuador has American dollars too.

290
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
That's right.

291
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,480
Actually, Ecuador went through a very difficult economic situation in late 1998, early 1999,

292
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,400
where there was hyperinflation.

293
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,640
So basically there was an inflation that was very, very, very large.

294
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,640
So that means that the old currency lost its value very fast.

295
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Exactly.

296
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,180
So for example, if the currency before in Ecuador used to be sucres.

297
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:37,000
So if 10 sucres was $1, all of a sudden it was 50 sucres was $1.

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,600
It got to the point where goods and services went from $3,000 to $1 to $25,000 to $1.

299
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,440
Okay, so people have bags full of money and it's not really worth anything anymore.

300
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Exactly.

301
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,920
So what happened was the central bank couldn't absorb this currency depreciation.

302
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,040
They couldn't really regulate prices.

303
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,960
Basically salaries were about the same, so you have a lot less money comparatively.

304
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,080
And so the government decided that there were two options.

305
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,360
Either they would follow Argentina's example, what they did a couple of years before, and

306
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,840
set a fixed rate.

307
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,240
So in Argentina, it's $3 to $1.

308
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,760
Or we would just get rid of our currency and just use US dollars.

309
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,940
So that's what they did, right?

310
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,000
They used US dollars.

311
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,160
And now if you ever travel to Ecuador, you will use US dollars.

312
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,320
The same exact bills that you use in the US are the same exact bills in Ecuador.

313
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
So no need to exchange currency.

314
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,360
No need to exchange currency.

315
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,200
And that's why I guess there are many factors that people say are a lot better.

316
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,220
For example, trading has become a lot less complicated because now you're negotiating

317
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,120
in US dollars as in everywhere else in the world.

318
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,520
But then other things, as you know, not having a national currency also affects.

319
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,560
So there are a lot of things going on.

320
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,080
But it's an interesting topic.

321
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Very interesting.

322
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Well, so maybe for those of you who are listening, you could tell us about your country and your

323
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,280
currency.

324
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
What do you use?

325
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
What do you spend money on?

326
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,080
And do people buy and trade currencies where you're from?

327
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Exactly.

328
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,440
Or maybe you can even enlighten us with the exchange rate maybe.

329
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,760
Usually it's a good question to ask how much is a liter of milk or how much is a haircut.

330
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Right.

331
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,200
Because these are things that everyone needs.

332
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
So the price doesn't change that much.

333
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Exactly.

334
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,480
Well, we're really curious to know how inexpensive or maybe very expensive your country is.

335
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,920
So come to EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

336
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Bye.

337
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:55,180
Bye.
