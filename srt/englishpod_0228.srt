00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,600
My name is Catherine and today we've got an intermediate level lesson all about going

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
to the beach.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
That's right.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,280
You know, it's a very popular thing to do, especially during the summer.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
It's hot.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,240
You want to go maybe to the beach to lay on the sand and maybe get some color.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,480
And also swim in the ocean.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,640
Yeah, it's a nice way to cool off when it's really hot in the summer.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
That's right.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,640
We're going to talk about the beach and a lot of vocab that we find related to this

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
activity.

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,160
But before we get into the dialogue, we have a word for you on Vocabulary Preview.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Vocabulary Preview.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,600
So the keyword today here is jellyfish.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Jellyfish.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,160
So jellyfish is actually an animal, right?

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
That's right.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
It's a very dangerous animal.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,580
It's a small little animal.

23
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,000
So these things live in the water and they often live in shallow areas and they can sting

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,560
They look like little plastic bags with little strings attached to it.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,400
And they just float around and if you happen to touch one, it hurts a lot.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,720
Yeah, it can be very painful.

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
So jellyfish is our word today.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,680
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a minute to talk more about

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
what's going on.

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:31,600
Oh George, what a beautiful day it is.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,240
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,040
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,760
The kids are going to have so much fun and we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
playing.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,520
It does seem like the perfect day.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,120
This looks like the perfect spot.

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,360
Okay kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,640
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
There we go.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
Can you help me with the umbrella?

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,080
Perfect.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,200
Okay kids, here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,920
I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,200
Don't stray too far.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,080
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
And stay in the shallow area.

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,480
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,280
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
You're back already?

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
The water was too cold, huh?

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll tell you a secret.

55
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
It'll be warmer in there.

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,320
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Ah!

59
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
What is that?

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
A jellyfish?

61
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,720
Jeremy, put that down right now.

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
It could sting you.

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Ah!

64
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Not on me!

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Ah!

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,040
Alright, great, we're back.

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,280
So now why don't we take a look at four key words that we have prepared for you today

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,440
on Language Takeaway.

69
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,760
Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,200
First up, we have a very important thing to bring to the beach, especially if you're like

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,940
me and you burn easily.

72
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,760
So this thing is called sunscreen.

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Okay, sunscreen.

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,280
Now this is a liquid and you put it on your skin, right?

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
And this protects you from the sun.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,800
So basically you put this cream all over your body to prevent sunburns, to prevent burning

77
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
under the sun.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
It's very important.

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,800
So it's called sunscreen or also sometimes called sunblock.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
That's right.

81
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Okay, very good.

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,440
Now we have our sunscreen and we arrive to the beach and one of the parents say, alright,

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
we're going to set up camp.

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
Okay, to set up camp.

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,160
Well, this might be confusing because as many of you know, camp, camping, this is an activity,

86
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,240
but we're not actually camping here.

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,320
We're just going to be at the beach for one day.

88
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,400
So to set up camp means to organize or arrange ourselves in a place.

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,260
So it's a colloquial way of saying we are going to organize the area where we're going

90
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,400
to spend the day.

91
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,080
We're going to make ourselves comfortable.

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,240
So you set up camp.

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,440
So not necessarily that you're going to camp there, but that you're going to prepare the

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
area.

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,320
So this could be used in many other different areas, right?

96
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
That's right.

97
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,760
So sometimes when tickets for really popular concerts go on sale, people line up for days

98
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,840
before they can buy the tickets.

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,280
Well, if you're in line, you maybe want to set up camp.

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,320
That means make yourself comfortable, sit down, bring a book, open some food packages.

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
Right, exactly.

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,280
So to set up camp.

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,480
And well, when we go to the beach, we want to sit down or lay down on the sand.

104
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,480
And in order to do this, we usually bring along beach towels.

105
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
That's right, Marco.

106
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,360
So towels can be any kind of towel.

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,640
You have a towel in your bathroom or in your kitchen.

108
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,260
Basically a piece of cloth that you use to dry yourself.

109
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,360
But the special kind of towel we bring to the beach is called, of course, a beach towel.

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,560
These are usually much bigger than normal towels.

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,280
Yeah, they're very, very big.

112
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,280
And this is usually because you want to lay down on the sand on top of this towel, right?

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
That's right.

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Okay.

115
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,240
And the last word that we have for language takeaway is a beach umbrella or just an umbrella.

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
That's right.

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,880
So maybe you're lying down on this big, comfortable, soft beach towel, and you're afraid of being

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,280
under the sun too much.

119
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,640
So an umbrella is a way to protect yourself from the sun.

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,600
It provides shade.

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
That's right.

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
So it's called an umbrella.

123
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,160
Or usually if you want to distinguish between the umbrella you use for the rain, you can

124
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,760
call it a beach umbrella.

125
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
That's right.

126
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Okay.

127
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,520
And these are usually a lot bigger and you don't actually carry them around in your hand.

128
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,040
You have to put them into the sand.

129
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
That's right.

130
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
So it stands alone.

131
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Okay.

132
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,160
So four key phrases there for you on language takeaway.

133
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly.

134
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,640
Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is.

135
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,280
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

136
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,080
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

137
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,840
The kids are going to have so much fun and we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're

138
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
playing.

139
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,600
It does seem like the perfect day.

140
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

141
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
This looks like the perfect spot.

142
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,360
Okay, kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

143
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

144
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,180
There we go.

145
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,840
Can you help me with the umbrella?

146
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Perfect.

147
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,480
Okay, kids, here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

148
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,920
I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave.

149
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,160
Don't stray too far.

150
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,120
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

151
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
And stay in the shallow area.

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,480
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

153
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,280
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

154
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
You're back already?

155
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,520
The water was too cold, huh?

156
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,760
I'll tell you a secret.

157
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,040
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

158
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
It'll be warmer in there.

159
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Ah!

161
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
What is that?

162
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
A jellyfish?

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Jeremy, put that down right now.

164
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
It could sting you.

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Ah!

166
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Not on me!

167
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Ah!

168
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,040
Alright, we're back.

169
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,400
So now we have five more words that we're going to take a look at in Language Takeaway

170
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,600
Part 2.

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Language Takeaway

172
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,360
Okay, so there are lots of fun things to do at the beach.

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,040
And today we're not going to be talking about all of them because there are too many things.

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,680
But one fun activity is playing frisbee.

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,160
That's right, frisbee.

176
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
So this is a thing.

177
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,400
It's an object, a frisbee.

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,360
Or you also play frisbee.

179
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
That's right.

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,200
So a frisbee itself is usually made of plastic and it's like a plate.

181
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,920
And it's very light and you throw it to your friends and it sails through the air.

182
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,200
Right, it kind of flies along the air and then somebody else has to catch it.

183
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
That's right.

184
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,460
So you can play frisbee or throw the frisbee.

185
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,320
It's very popular with people playing frisbee with their dogs, right?

186
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,760
You throw the frisbee and the dog chases it.

187
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,480
Dogs love frisbee.

188
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,880
Alright, another great activity that usually we do when we go to the beach is we build

189
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
sand castles.

190
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,520
Okay, so I'm a master sand castle builder.

191
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm a really big fan of this activity.

192
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Really?

193
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,720
Basically, you use water and sand to create castles.

194
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,400
And obviously, you have to use tools like shovels and buckets.

195
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,480
Otherwise, it might look kind of funny.

196
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,440
And this is actually such a popular activity that there are even competitions at times.

197
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,220
People will not only build castles or houses or structures but maybe a statue of some sort

198
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,320
or an animal or different things.

199
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
That's right or people.

200
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
People, yeah.

201
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,880
So sand castle.

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Okay.

203
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,920
And well, whenever we go to the beach, the ocean can be a little bit dangerous.

204
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,200
And that's why in the dialogue, one of the parents told their kids to stay in the shallow

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
area of the water.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
That's right.

207
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,380
So shallow is it describes depth.

208
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,800
So how deep something is.

209
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Something is shallow, it's not very deep.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,940
So there's very little water.

211
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,720
But if there's a lot of water, maybe if you swim and you can't touch your feet on the

212
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,980
ground, we call that deep.

213
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,560
So shallow is very low water and deep is lots and lots of water.

214
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay, very good.

215
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,740
So you'll usually find this in the ocean.

216
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,060
If you go further, further, further in, it'll get deeper and deeper and deeper.

217
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,480
And more and more dangerous.

218
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Right.

219
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,240
And this is why the mom also told the kid to not pass that sandbar that was ahead.

220
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
Okay, sandbar.

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,160
This is a piece of sand that basically rises very high in the water.

222
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,720
So usually when you're on the beach and you go into the water and it gets deeper and deeper

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,340
and then all of a sudden it gets high again and there's more sand.

224
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,320
And so that part that you can stand on, that sand out in the water, that's called a sandbar.

225
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,560
It's almost like a little island.

226
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,920
Yeah, exactly.

227
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,800
And as you said, usually it gets deeper, deeper, then you have the sandbar so it gets higher.

228
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,440
But usually if you pass the sandbar, it's going to get really deep all of a sudden.

229
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
That's right.

230
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,240
So that's why the mother doesn't want her child to go past the sandbar.

231
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Right.

232
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,720
And as well, if you're ever swimming in a swimming pool in the ocean, it's always a

233
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,880
good idea if you don't know how to swim well or if you have children to take along little

234
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
floaties.

235
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Okay, floaties.

236
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I like this word.

237
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,640
Floaties are plastic rings that you put around your arms or maybe around your stomach and

238
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
they're filled with air.

239
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Right.

240
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,720
So when you go in the water, they help you float.

241
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Exactly.

242
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
So this is a very common thing to put on children because they don't know how to swim well.

243
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,520
So you put them little floaties on their arms or around their stomachs and then they can

244
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
just float and they won't drown.

245
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
That's right.

246
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Floaties.

247
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Very good.

248
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,720
So a lot of key words there are related to the fun of going to the beach.

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,200
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for the very last time.

250
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:29,320
Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is.

251
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,960
The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there.

252
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,800
What a perfect day to be at the beach.

253
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
The kids are going to have so much fun and we'll be able to relax in the sun while they're

254
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,120
playing.

255
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,320
It does seem like the perfect day.

256
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather.

257
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,560
This looks like the perfect spot.

258
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,080
Okay, kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp.

259
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,400
Here Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

260
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
There we go.

261
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,440
Can you help me with the umbrella?

262
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Perfect.

263
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
Okay, kids.

264
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,960
Here's a beach ball and a frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

265
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,640
I want to see an impressive sand castle by the time we leave.

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Don't stray too far.

267
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,800
Wait, leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

268
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,280
And stay in the shallow area.

269
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't want to see you go any further than that sandbar.

270
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floaties.

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,280
You're back already?

272
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
The water was too cold, huh?

273
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,560
I'll tell you a secret.

274
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Do you see that small pool of water over there?

275
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
It'll be warmer in there.

276
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,120
Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

277
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Ah!

278
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
What is that?

279
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
A jellyfish?

280
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,400
Jeremy, put that down right now.

281
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,040
It could sting you.

282
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Ah!

283
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Not on me!

284
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Ah!

285
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,120
All right, so beach activities.

286
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,480
You say you're a master sand castle builder.

287
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
I love building sand castles.

288
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,840
I won't say that I'm very good at it.

289
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Maybe not a professional.

290
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,080
But I do a pretty good sand castle.

291
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,480
Do you like getting buried in the sand?

292
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
I love it.

293
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Really?

294
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Although it also scares me.

295
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,400
Have you ever had someone maybe cover you with sand and then you can't move?

296
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Yeah.

297
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,680
Yeah, so it's a little bit scary.

298
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,480
Obviously I'm not very comfortable with having my head covered.

299
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
But some people even do that.

300
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,760
They cover their entire body, head to toe.

301
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
How do they breathe?

302
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,400
And they have a straw out of their mouth to breathe.

303
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Wow.

304
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,880
I actually love going to the beach and it's relaxing, it's really fun.

305
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,240
But I don't really enjoy it going when there are a lot of people.

306
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,040
Because I like to relax on the beach.

307
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,560
But when there are too many people, they're running around, there are kids running around

308
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
and it's not very relaxing.

309
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,800
Yeah, I hear you.

310
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
But swimming in the ocean is also very dangerous, right?

311
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
It can be.

312
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,160
So we recommend you go places where there are lifeguards on duty or that you go with

313
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
an expert swimmer.

314
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Lifeguards.

315
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Yeah.

316
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,440
That's all we've got though for today.

317
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,840
We hope you've enjoyed this lesson and we hope you're excited about the upcoming summer

318
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
months.

319

We'll see you guys there.

322
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Bye.

323
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:25,840
All right.

324
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,420
Man.

325
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,880
All right.
