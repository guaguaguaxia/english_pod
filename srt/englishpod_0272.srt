00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,820
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,880
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson all about a very

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,480
special kind of person who helps you out with your kids.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
That's right.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Today we want to get a nanny.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
A nanny.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
A nanny.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,760
So, a nanny is a person, usually a woman, but it can be a man as well I guess.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
And this person takes care of your children when you're working or when you're out

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
of the house.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
That's right.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,080
So, this is what's going on today.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,600
We're going to see what type of responsibilities a nanny has.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,880
And so, let's listen to her dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:45,760
Hey Mel, are you up for some tennis today?

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,280
Sorry, I can't.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,200
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack,

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,760
then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
You sound exhausted.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,240
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,360
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,560
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,680
Oh, I don't know.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,560
It's hard to find the right nanny.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,940
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,640
she interacts with the kids.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,720
I would love to have someone to help me out though.

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,280
I think you should definitely consider it.

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,280
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule and you'll still get to spend

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,680
time with the kids in the evenings.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,840
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,000
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,640
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,600
Oh, that's great.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Thanks Grace.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Can you give me her number?

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,920
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,440
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day and Julie and I might even get to go on a

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,400
date once in a while.

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Alright, we're back.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,120
So now let's take a look at some key words on Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,640
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,880
So as you said, Marco, we don't just find a nanny, we hire a nanny.

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,760
So what does the word hire mean?

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,640
Okay, so we have the verb to hire someone and that means to get someone to work for

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,200
you and you pay them obviously money in exchange for their services.

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay, so this is different from finding a job for someone because I could find a job

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
for someone but maybe that job is at a restaurant.

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,000
But when I hire someone, that means I want that person to work for me or for my company.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,280
So in this case, obviously we are not a company, we are just a couple of people who are looking

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
for a nanny.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,040
So we need to hire a nanny.

55
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,080
We need to get her to work for us and obviously you would pay her a salary.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Alright so when you pay her a salary, you also have some expectations about what the

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
nanny will do.

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,160
So one of those expectations is that the nanny will take the children to their after school

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
activities.

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
That's right.

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,960
So this is a phrase if you will or a type of thing that happens after school.

62
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,000
So usually children, when they finish their classes, they have some things that they can

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
do at school like for example sports.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,560
So this is very common in America but not so common in other parts of the world.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,440
So just to explain, if your child is in high school or middle school, after school is over,

67
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,280
there's no more class, your child might want to play soccer or to go to art class.

68
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,720
And these are things that you do at the school but it's usually considered an activity, not

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
a class.

70
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,680
So we call these after school activities.

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
That's right.

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,400
So these activities are usually for recreation.

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,960
They're not really part of the curriculum.

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,480
It's not a class.

75
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,600
No, you don't get marks or grades for these.

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
These are just for fun.

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,400
A lot of people work and so they need to have these activities for their kids to stay at

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,160
school until they finish working.

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
That's right.

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Okay, so we want the nanny to take the children or pick them up from their after school activities

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,280
and we also need the nanny to help out with some household chores.

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Okay, so you should know where these chores are being done.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,880
The first word is household which means in the house.

84
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,840
Okay, so examples of household chores would be like cleaning the windows.

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,200
Washing the dishes.

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,880
Or doing laundry.

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,000
So basically any type of cleaning around the house.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
That's right, making the house look nicer.

89
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
And so usually children have chores.

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,080
These are things they need to do but a nanny can also help with household chores.

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,560
Okay, and also we want the nanny to help and run some errands.

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,200
Okay, so this is funny.

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,640
This phrasal, this phrase uses the word to run but we're not running like a sport.

94
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,440
We're going to do some errands but the verb here is to run errands.

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,240
So Marco, on Sunday I have to run some errands.

96
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm sorry I can't go out to the movie with you guys.

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,880
Okay, so to run errands, what does that mean?

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,000
Well an errand is like a job or a task that you have to do but it's usually not something

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,760
you get paid for.

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,240
To run an errand is like to go to the grocery store and pick up food or to pick up your

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
clothes at the laundromat.

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,200
You have dry cleaning.

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Okay so they're kind of like chores I guess but you don't really do them in the house.

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
You have to go outside and run these errands.

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,480
You have to go pay your bills for example.

106
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,520
Exactly and so when I was growing up, on the weekends my mother would always run all of

107
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,400
her errands because during the week she had to work.

108
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,440
Okay, very good.

109
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,200
So a lot of interesting words there.

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,560
I think we can go ahead and listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,280
with Fluency Builder.

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:50,760
Hey Mel, are you up for some tennis today?

113
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,280
Sorry, I can't.

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,080
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school and make them an afternoon snack

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,920
then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
You sound exhausted.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,400
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

118
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,520
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,760
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

120
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,840
Oh, I don't know.

121
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,720
It's hard to find the right nanny.

122
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,100
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her and how

123
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,800
she interacts with the kids.

124
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
I would love to have someone to help me out though.

125
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
I think you should definitely consider it.

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,680
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule and you'll still get to spend time

127
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,800
with the kids in the evenings.

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,000
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,120
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

130
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,920
She's very responsible, a good cook and great with kids.

131
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
Oh, that's great.

132
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Thanks Grace.

133
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Can you give me her number?

134
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,080
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,600
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day and Julie and I might even get to go on a

136
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,320
date once in a while.

137
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,960
Alright we're back with Fluency Builder and so let's take a look at some of these phrases

138
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
now.

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
Fluency Builder.

140
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,680
So this first phrase is a very spoken English phrase, something that you're going to hear

141
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,320
all the time, especially if you're talking to your American friends.

142
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,360
We say, are you up for some tennis today?

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,760
To be up for.

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,320
Okay, so to be up for something.

145
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,000
This is from the very first sentence when Grace says, hey Mel, are you up for some tennis

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
today?

147
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,540
What does it mean if I ask someone if they are up for some tennis?

148
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,820
This means, would you like to play tennis today?

149
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,260
Are you interested in playing tennis today?

150
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,680
So is this a good idea for you?

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
Do you want to do this?

152
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,560
So basically, are you willing to play tennis today?

153
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Yes.

154
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Alright, so to be up for is to be interested in or willing to do something.

155
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,320
Are you up for a movie tonight?

156
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,400
Okay, or maybe you can ask your friend, are you up for grabbing a bite to eat later on?

157
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Absolutely, I'm hungry.

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,660
So to be up for is a good way to ask a question.

159
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,520
After that though, we have another phrase.

160
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,320
This phrase is very important when you're trying to get someone to help you.

161
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
So how do we ask, can you help me?

162
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,520
In the dialogue we saw how Mel said that it would be a great idea to get a nanny because

163
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,480
she would love to have someone to help me out.

164
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,140
So to help someone out, to help me out.

165
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,000
So this is interesting because you could say, I need someone to help me.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,680
But it's more common to hear the phrase, to help me out.

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
So you're not going out.

168
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,000
It doesn't have to do with space.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,160
But we just say this phrase, to help out, means to help someone.

170
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,160
So it's basically the exact same thing, but it just sounds a lot more natural.

171
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Exactly.

172
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
So, Marco, I'm moving tomorrow.

173
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,000
Do you have some time to help me out?

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,720
Okay, so you say help me out, but you could also say, do you have time to help me?

175
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,140
And both are okay.

176
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,840
Or if I'm talking about me and my friend, we're really busy tomorrow.

177
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Do you have any time to help us out?

178
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,860
Okay, so we just changed the person there.

179
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,360
We went to the plural form.

180
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,080
Me, us, you.

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,280
Okay, very good.

182
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,320
And so for our last phrase, this is actually also very interesting.

183
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,280
When Grace was telling Mel that she's really busy and if she gets a nanny, she wouldn't

184
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,600
have to juggle such a busy schedule.

185
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,160
All right, so the key verb here is to juggle.

186
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,920
Now I wish I could show this to you guys, but as this is an audio podcast, I can't.

187
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,800
What does the verb to juggle mean, Marco?

188
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,320
Well, I don't know if you've ever seen clowns or at a circus where people have three balls

189
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,400
and they throw them in the air with two hands and they're basically throwing stuff in the

190
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,880
air, sometimes balls or pins and stuff like that.

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Sometimes fire.

192
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Fire.

193
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,040
So that's to juggle, basically to have many things in your hands and be able to move them

194
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
at the same time.

195
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,880
All right, so when you're talking about a busy schedule, this means that you have lots

196
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,280
and lots of things to do.

197
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,280
It's important to be able to juggle your busy schedule.

198
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,280
That means to handle doing many things at the same time.

199
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
That's right.

200
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,200
All right, so another way to say this is because you're so busy right now, having a nanny will

201
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,240
help you complete your tasks or finish what you need to do.

202
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
That's right.

203
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,400
So you can also say the CEO of the company has to juggle a very busy schedule.

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,680
All right, he has many, many things to do in general.

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
That's right.

206
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,320
So a lot of stuff.

207
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one last time and we'll be back to

208
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,040
talk a little bit more.

209
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:36,400
Hey Mel, are you up for some tennis today?

210
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,960
Sorry, I can't.

211
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,080
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school and make them an afternoon snack,

212
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,640
then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

213
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,660
You sound exhausted.

214
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,160
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

215
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,280
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

216
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,560
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

217
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh, I don't know.

218
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,440
It's hard to find the right nanny.

219
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,840
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her and how

220
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,520
she interacts with the kids.

221
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,640
I would love to have someone to help me out though.

222
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,200
I think you should definitely consider it.

223
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule and you'll still get to spend time

224
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,560
with the kids in the evenings.

225
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,740
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

226
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,880
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

227
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,520
She's very responsible, a good cook and great with kids.

228
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Oh, that's great.

229
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Thanks Grace.

230
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Can you give me her number?

231
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,840
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

232
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,360
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day and Julie and I might even get to go on a

233
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,640
date once in a while.

234
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,280
So there are a lot of people all over the world who have nannies.

235
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,880
I often see them when I go to New York City.

236
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,920
You know, women who take out the kids and they push them in strollers and mom and dad

237
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,280
maybe go to work or have classes or something.

238
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
That's right.

239
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,680
Now this is interesting because there's also another word called a babysitter, but it's

240
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
different, right?

241
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,280
There's a difference between a nanny and a babysitter.

242
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,660
They both take care of kids, but I think it's the time that they do it that's the difference.

243
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
That's right.

244
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,640
So nannies are usually hired on a contract basis.

245
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,240
You say, I need a nanny to come and watch my kids every day, Monday to Friday for the

246
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,960
next six months.

247
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,760
But with a babysitter, you say, hey, my husband and I, we want to go to watch a movie on Friday.

248
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Can you come for two hours?

249
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Okay.

250
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
All right.

251
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,160
So a nanny is long-term.

252
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,800
It's someone who maybe lives with you, someone who does some work at your house, someone

253
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,400
who cleans the dishes and watches the kids.

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,200
A babysitter just comes once a month or just when you need her.

255
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
That's right.

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Okay.

257
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,240
So that's the main difference between a nanny and a babysitter.

258
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,680
Now, as you said, they're very, very common nowadays because I guess it's not like before

259
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,800
when women usually would stay at home and take care of the children.

260
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,760
Now both parents usually work and so more people are getting nannies.

261
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
That's right.

262
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Although nannies can be very expensive.

263
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
It depends where you live.

264
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,840
And so for people who can't afford a nanny, if a nanny is too expensive, the child, the

265
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
baby will go to daycare.

266
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,640
And that's actually like a place where many babies or children are together and there's

267
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,320
one teacher or one nanny who takes care of everyone.

268
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
That's right.

269
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
So it's an interesting topic.

270
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,920
Maybe some of our listeners grew up with a nanny or had a nanny when they were growing

271
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
up.

272
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
Or maybe you have kids of your own and you have a nanny now.

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah.

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let us know.

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
