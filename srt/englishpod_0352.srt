00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,560
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,600
And today, Marco, we're talking about some very special places, right?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
That's right.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,040
Today we're going to talk about the famous list of the seven wonders of the world.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,240
So you've probably heard about this before.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,320
We're not going to tell you what this means quite yet.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
And when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more about what these wonders are and

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
where they are.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:36,480
Have you seen this news article?

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,120
Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,040
and people could vote for them online.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
Wow, that's really interesting.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,520
So who would?

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,560
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
I've been there.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,800
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,600
The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
are covered with gems and emeralds.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,240
Cool.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Also amongst the winners is Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, and the pyramid in Chichen

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Itza in Mexico.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,320
It also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders.

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,000
I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
year.

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Good idea.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,760
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,400
So let's talk about these very interesting places all over the world.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,520
Now on Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,360
Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,800
So the set phrase for this, Marco, is the seven wonders of the world.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Now the key here is the word wonder.

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
What is a wonder?

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Right.

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
A wonder is something very amazing, incredible.

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,400
It's something that's beyond your imagination almost.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
That's right.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,960
You can't even imagine how man or how someone created it.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,200
And so wonderful is a similar word that's an adjective, something that's just great,

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,080
fantastic is wonderful.

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,320
A wonder is something very, very special.

46
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,720
And here we have seven of them.

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
That's right.

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,000
And it's a list basically that you can see even online about these wonders all over the

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,400
world and they're so special because they are amazing works of art and architecture.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,640
And starting off with one of the most famous ones is in China.

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,680
It's the Great Wall of China.

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,440
I think what's special about this I've heard is that when astronauts are in space, it's

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,720
so long and so distinct they can actually see the Great Wall.

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,420
Yeah, that's what I've heard as well.

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,640
It's a very long wall, thousands of kilometers long.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
That's right.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,200
And it goes east to west all across the northern border of China.

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
That's right.

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,520
So it's a very big wall.

60
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,240
And what's interesting about it is that it was built such a long time ago and that the

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,560
techniques used to make it were very special.

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
That's right.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,200
And sometimes you might hear us talk about the Great Wall instead of the Great Wall of

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
China.

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,480
And so that's just a hint.

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
It's easy to say Great Wall.

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,560
You can say them both ways though.

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Exactly.

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,340
Now moving west towards India, we have another very amazing work of architecture.

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,560
It's called the Taj Mahal.

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,160
Now the Taj Mahal is in North India in a city called Agra.

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,200
And it's very special because it's massive, it's very big, and it's all white marble.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
That's right.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,560
And it's interesting because this place, the Taj Mahal, is not really a temple.

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,520
It was actually a tomb.

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
All right.

77
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
Now that's an interesting word to look at.

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,720
A tomb is a place where we bury someone, you know, after someone dies.

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,800
Maybe if you have a lot of money, you're very rich, you want to put that body in a very

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
special sacred place.

81
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,880
And that's called a tomb.

82
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
That's right.

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,000
So this is actually what the Taj Mahal is.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,480
Now we saw in the dialogue that the entire complex of the Taj Mahal is made of white

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
marble.

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,720
So when we talk about the entire complex, what do we mean?

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,520
Well complex here is a noun.

88
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,000
You might have heard it in other situations where it's an adjective, it means something

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
different.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,440
But here a complex means many buildings together, right?

91
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,280
So you can say the Taj Mahal is one building.

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,600
But the Taj Mahal complex maybe has four or five buildings together.

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,880
So a side temple and a gatehouse.

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,040
And so we say a complex is a grouping of buildings.

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
That's right.

96
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Very good.

97
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,760
So now let's move on.

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,880
Let's take a look at Language Takeaway Part 2 and let's continue talking about these wonders

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
of the world.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Now the top of our list in Language Takeaway Part 2 is actually a place I would love to

101
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
go to.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280
I've never been there.

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
It's in Jordan, which is a country in the Middle East and it's called Petra.

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Petra.

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
That's right.

106
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,560
So it's actually a city but it's also known as the lost city of Petra, right?

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
That's right.

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,880
And what's unique about this city is that the city is built.

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,080
It's carved out of stone in this cliff.

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,360
So it's not just pieces of stone put together.

111
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,040
It's actually inside the rocks.

112
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Exactly.

113
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,520
So it's very famous.

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,480
You've probably seen it in movies like Indiana Jones.

115
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,560
There's a big part of the scenes that go on inside Petra.

116
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,320
Very special place and again very unique.

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,420
Now the next site is actually very far away in South America and again it's ancient and

118
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,240
very intricate.

119
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,200
It's called Machu Picchu.

120
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
That's right.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,560
So this is in one of those very old cities that are actually in ruins now and the interesting

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,680
thing about it is that it's very high up in like a little mountain.

123
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,040
And those mountains there, those are the Andes, right?

124
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
That's right.

125
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,680
So Machu Picchu, also a very famous place.

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,400
Many visitors from all over the world go there as well.

127
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,760
And another main attraction around the world are the pyramids.

128
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
So we have some pyramids in Egypt.

129
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,040
I think those are the most well-known ones.

130
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
That's right.

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,480
The pyramids in Egypt like the Pyramid of Giza are very big structures.

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,840
I mean they're huge and they were built thousands of years ago but they're still here because

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,640
they were built so well.

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,200
But there are also very famous pyramids like the one we heard about today in the dialogue

135
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
in Mexico.

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
That's right.

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,520
It's a little bit different though because the pyramids as we, most of us know them,

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
they're very smooth on the sides you would say.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,320
Yeah, you can't climb on them really, right?

140
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Right.

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Well this one in Mexico actually has kind of like steps.

142
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,800
So it's a different type of pyramid but the shape is very similar.

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Alright.

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,560
So the pyramids here are in a place called Chichen Itza.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,340
You might have heard of that.

146
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,760
And we have another place though which is also in South America in the city of Rio de

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Janeiro.

148
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Now this one is actually a statue, right?

149
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
That's right.

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
It's called the Christ Redeemer.

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,560
It's a very big statue, very famous.

152
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
You've seen it maybe in pictures.

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,200
It's a statue of Jesus with his arms open.

154
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,960
Now the word Redeemer, okay, a Redeemer is a person, someone who does something, who

155
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,680
redeems.

156
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,400
What does it mean to be a Redeemer?

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Well, a Redeemer is a person that saves souls for example.

158
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,280
So if you redeem yourself, you're redeeming yourself of your sins maybe.

159
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,920
Well yeah, you're taking value back, right?

160
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,320
And so in the case of Jesus, he is taking away the sins of the world and he's redeeming,

161
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,680
you know, that's why his arms are out.

162
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
He's redeeming all people.

163
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
And that's the idea I think behind the Christ Redeemer statue.

164
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,480
So the verb redeem, like you can use it in everyday life if you take a coupon and you

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
redeem it.

166
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,200
That means you, yeah, you collect the value.

167
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
You collect the value, right?

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,960
So you can use it, actually this word in everyday life.

169
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
You can.

170
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,160
And moving on now towards Europe, we have the famous Colosseum.

171
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,960
Ooh, now I love this one.

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I've actually been there and I know you have too recently.

173
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,000
But this is a circular, like a round stadium.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,880
So it's a place where you play sports.

175
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Well, you did.

176
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,800
It was from, you know, thousands of years ago, the Roman Empire.

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,560
And it's in very good shape I would say.

178
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
You can still see it.

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Yeah.

180
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,840
So it's actually called the Colosseum, although a Colosseum as we know it now can also be

181
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
the same thing, right?

182
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,240
A structure where sports or activities are played.

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
Basically, yeah, a Colosseum is an old stadium.

184
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
But the Colosseum, like you said, is definitely the Colosseum in Rome.

185
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
That's right.

186
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,840
And we've probably seen movies of ancient Rome where sports or activities were taking

187
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,740
place, specifically gladiator fights.

188
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,400
So that's our word there, gladiator.

189
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah, that's right.

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,720
A gladiator is actually a person.

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,240
And a gladiator was a man who thousands of years ago during the Roman Empire would fight

192
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,520
maybe other men or animals and he had to fight to stay alive.

193
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,320
So that was his profession basically, to be a gladiator.

194
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,760
So now as you are a boxer, back then you were a gladiator.

195
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Yeah.

196
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,520
And there are actually some very famous movies about gladiators, like the movie Gladiator

197
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,640
with Russell Crowe.

198
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,960
So it's a pretty common word these days.

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
That's right.

200
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Okay.

201
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
So let's take a break.

202
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
We'll be back in a bit.

203
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Have you seen this news article?

204
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Apparently, an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world

205
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
and people could vote for them online.

206
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Wow, that's really interesting.

207
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
So who would?

208
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

209
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I've been there.

210
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

211
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
The entire world is in it.

212
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
And it's a great place to be.

213
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I've been there.

214
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I've been there.

215
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I've been there.

216
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I've been there.

217
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I've been there.

218
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I've been there.

219
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
I've been there.

220
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I've been there.

221
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I've been there.

222
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I've been there.

223
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I've been there.

224
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I've been there.

225
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
I've been there.

226
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I've been there.

227
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I've been there.

228
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:36,540
it was voted online.

229
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,680
People all over the world out of different candidates or different places that were considered

230
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,780
to be the new seven wonders of the world.

231
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,780
Among those, like some of them that didn't win for example was Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

232
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Yeah, I never understood that.

233
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:58,780
I think Angkor Wat is such an amazing place and so big and it was the heart of this old civilization.

234
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,780
And instead we have other things like a statue.

235
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
Yeah, I don't agree with it as well.

236
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,780
But actually the Statue of Liberty of the United States was also considered as a candidate for a wonder of the world.

237
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Well, that's right. America doesn't have any wonders.

238
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,780
You have natural wonders I think. The Grand Canyon is considered I think one of those natural wonders.

239
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Yes, I think Niagara Falls also maybe.

240
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
But that's an interesting point though, Marco.

241
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,780
We've got the great wonders of the world and we've got the natural wonders.

242
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
What's the difference?

243
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Well, a natural wonder of the world means that it's there naturally.

244
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
It's not man-made.

245
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,780
All of these things that we see here, somebody had to make them.

246
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Whereas for example the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls, they are there naturally.

247
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
It's by nature.

248
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,780
All right. So man-made versus natural or made by nature.

249
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Right. So it's very interesting because you have like we said natural seven wonders of the world.

250
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
You have these, the new ones.

251
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,780
You have the ancient world wonders which like none of them exist anymore.

252
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
I think only the pyramids.

253
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:06,780
That's right. The hanging gardens of Babylon and the colossus at Rhodes.

254
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Yeah.

255
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,780
Yeah, those ones are very cool but not like you said, not around anymore.

256
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:20,780
But maybe some of you actually, maybe your countries were considered to host one of these wonders or maybe you voted for some of them.

257
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
Yeah, let us know.

258
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,780
What is a wonder where you come from?

259
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
It doesn't have to be on this list.

260
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,780
It can be something you think is wonderful.

261
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Let us know.

262
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

263
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
All right. We'll see you guys there.

264
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
Bye.

265
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Bye.
