00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,840
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,140
And today we're back in the office.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,360
We have a lesson that's talking about something that goes wrong in the office.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,640
Yes, something that I can really understand well, but we'll talk about that later.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,160
So this lesson is about a photocopier.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,320
A photocopier.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,320
So let's take a look at this word in vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,360
All right, so a photocopier makes copies.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,880
Yeah, it makes copies of documents.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,440
We often call it a copier or a copy machine.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,480
Yeah, so you can call it a photocopier, copy machine or copier.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, or a Xerox machine as well.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Xerox machine.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,160
Yeah, we can talk about that a little bit later because that's an interesting story.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Okay.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,280
All right, let's take a look at our next word.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Toner.

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Toner.

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Toner.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Toner.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Toner.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
Toner is what the copy machine uses to make copies.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
It's like the ink.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Right.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,240
It's a very fine black powder.

29
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Oh.

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
So it's not an ink.

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
No, it's actually dry.

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Okay.

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
It's dry.

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
It's a powder, so you don't want to get that all over you.

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
All right.

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,760
Well, good advice, Marco.

39
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,080
And our last word in vocabulary preview, malfunction.

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Malfunction.

41
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Malfunction.

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Malfunction.

43
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,960
Let's break down this word.

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
All right.

45
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,920
Malfunction is to work.

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Uh-huh.

47
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
All right.

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Mal.

49
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,280
I guess mal maybe comes from Latin or something because in Spanish we say mal, which is something

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,440
evil or not good.

51
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Okay.

52
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,160
So I think we can understand malfunction is not good working.

53
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Right?

54
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Yeah.

55
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Yeah.

56
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Okay.

57
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,000
More or less, it's not working properly.

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Not working properly.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah.

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Right.

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,360
Let's find out what isn't working properly.

63
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:05,240
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

64
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,040
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub branch.

65
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Sure.

66
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:25,720
I think I broke this thing.

67
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,480
Maxine, can you help me out here?

68
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm not really a tech guy.

69
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah, sure.

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,680
I think it's just out of toner.

71
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,080
You can go use the other one upstairs.

72
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:44,040
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,600
Damn it.

74
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,720
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

75
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,640
I'll send the stupid fax later.

76
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,760
Oh, great.

77
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

78
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
This is ridiculous.

79
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,160
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

80
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,800
Just take the stairs, dude.

81
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,480
What floor are you going to?

82
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,560
I have to go up 15 floors.

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Never mind.

84
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:23,000
Made it.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's a copier.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No!

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:45,720
Okay, so this copy machine is definitely not working properly.

88
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
A serious malfunction.

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,760
A serious malfunction.

90
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,480
I think the whole building exploded.

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,960
All right, very dramatic here at EnglishPod, but we have fun, right?

92
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Exactly.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:02,160
Okay, let's take a look at some of the great language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Language Takeaway.

95
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,040
All right, three words for you here in Language Takeaway, and we heard all of these in the

96
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
dialogue.

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,200
So this guy needs to get a copy ASAP.

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
ASAP.

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
ASAP.

100
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Or ASAP.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes, meaning?

102
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
As soon as possible.

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
So really, really fast.

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Yeah.

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,280
This is a very, very common phrase, right?

106
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,360
So it's an acronym, and you can say it like ASAP or?

107
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
ASAP.

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Exactly.

109
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah, usually people say it like that because it's too long, I guess, to say as soon as

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
possible.

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,640
So, hey, I need this document ASAP.

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Yes.

113
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Or ASAP.

114
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Exactly.

115
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,440
Okay, let's look at our next word.

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
A practical joke.

117
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
Practical joke.

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,640
Practical joke.

119
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Practical joke.

120
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,960
Okay, so a practical joke, I'm sure we have all played a practical joke on some of our

121
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
friends, right?

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Yes.

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Basically, what you do is you do something funny on purpose to someone.

124
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,360
Yeah, but something crazy.

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Crazy, right?

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Yeah.

127
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,000
For example, when I was in university, there was this guy in our building, and we took

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,760
all of his bedroom furniture, so his bed, his desk, everything, and put it down on the

129
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
football field.

130
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Nice.

131
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,440
Yeah, that was a practical joke.

132
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,440
That is a very good and elaborate practical joke.

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Yeah.

134
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,240
Okay, so practical joke, do something crazy or funny to your friends.

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Okay.

136
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,560
And now let's look at our last word.

137
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Never mind.

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Never mind.

139
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Never mind.

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Never mind.

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,520
Okay, so if you say never mind, it means...

142
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Don't worry about it.

143
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Don't worry about it.

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
Forget it.

145
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Forget it.

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Yeah.

147
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Never mind.

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Yeah.

149
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,840
Yeah, this is, you know, this is so common, and I think it would be helpful to understand

150
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,160
how it's used.

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,800
So let's hear some examples.

152
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,160
Example one.

153
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Someone stole my wallet.

154
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Oh, wait.

155
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Never mind.

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,880
Here it is.

157
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,520
Example two.

158
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,640
Can you get some milk on your way home?

159
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh, never mind.

160
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,640
We still have some.

161
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,280
Example three.

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
The printer's broken?

163
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Never mind.

164
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
I'll do this later.

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,840
Okay, great examples, and I think our language takeaway is clear.

166
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time, and then we'll come back

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,640
and talk about putting it together.

168
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:52,440
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

169
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,400
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

170
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Sure.

171
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,280
I think I broke this thing.

172
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Maxine, can you help me out here?

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm not really a tech guy.

174
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Yeah, sure.

175
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,400
I think it's just out of toner.

176
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,800
You can go use the other one upstairs.

177
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,120
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

178
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Sure.

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Damn it.

180
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,920
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

181
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll send the stupid fax later.

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Oh, great!

183
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

184
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,040
This is ridiculous!

185
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,280
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Just take the stairs, dude.

187
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,800
What floor are you going to?

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,560
I have to go up 15 floors!

189
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Never mind.

190
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Made it.

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
There's the copier.

192
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
No!

193
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,920
In this episode, we're going to learn how to use the computer to make a copy of a contract.

194
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,920
In this dialogue, there's some great language that can be used in many different patterns

195
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,080
or in many different ways.

196
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,680
So, in today's Putting It Together, we're going to show you how to use three of these

197
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,680
patterns.

198
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Putting It Together

199
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,040
Okay, the first pattern that we can look at is out of toner.

200
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,320
Out of toner.

201
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Right.

202
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,880
So, we already talked about toner.

203
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's talk about out of.

204
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,360
Okay, so when you are out of, you have none.

205
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Right.

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
So, let's change a little bit.

207
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,840
So, I can say, I am out of milk.

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm out of time.

209
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,400
Out of time, right?

210
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,480
If you're driving, I'm out of gas or gasoline.

211
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Yep.

212
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
So, out of plus noun.

213
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Perfect.

214
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
It means you don't have none.

215
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
EnglishPod.com.

216
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
EnglishPod.com.

217
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,920
You ain't got none.

218
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Eubonics.com.

219
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,720
All right.

220
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Out of time.

221
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,600
Let's take a look at our second one.

222
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
On your way up.

223
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,460
Yeah, on your way up.

224
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,960
On your way, right?

225
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,560
So, this is a great way when you are talking to someone and they're going somewhere.

226
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Yes.

227
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Right?

228
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
So, on your way up.

229
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,480
Can you bring this to HR?

230
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Okay.

231
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,960
On your way to the store.

232
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,640
Can you mail this letter?

233
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,900
Or maybe on your way home.

234
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,920
Can you buy me some flowers?

235
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Nice.

236
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
All right.

237
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,600
So, on your way, it means...

238
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,720
It means while you are going there.

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Right.

240
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah.

241
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,040
Taking advantage of the fact that you are going somewhere.

242
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Yes.

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Okay.

244
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Now, let's take a look at our last one.

245
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,520
And this is a really great phrase.

246
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Break down.

247
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Break down.

248
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,800
In our dialogue, we heard breaking down.

249
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes.

250
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Right?

251
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,560
Everything in the office seems to be breaking down.

252
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Right.

253
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,200
So, when something breaks down...

254
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
It stops working.

255
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
It stops working.

256
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Yeah.

257
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Exactly.

258
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
So, we can change it a little bit.

259
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,120
So, what if we say, break up?

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,760
Ooh, boyfriend and girlfriend.

261
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Right.

262
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
They end their relationship.

263
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Okay.

264
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
So, we can maybe think about it as their relationship stops working.

265
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Oh, nice one.

266
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Right?

267
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Yeah.

268
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Okay.

269
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
What about break in?

270
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
Enter a place using force.

271
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
Right.

272
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
You enter a house that's not yours.

273
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah.

274
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,480
So, if you break into a house, maybe you break the window and climb in.

275
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Okay.

276
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Mm-hmm.

277
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
What about break out?

278
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
The opposite.

279
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Right.

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,520
So, break out of jail.

281
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Break out of prison.

282
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Yeah.

283
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
So, this is a great phrase.

284
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,800
You can change the last word from break down, break up, break in, and it means different

285
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
things.

286
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Yeah.

287
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
So, use different prepositions for different meanings.

288
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Perfect.

289
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Mm-hmm.

290
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Okay.

291
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,200
So, now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and then Erica and I will be back

292
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,480
and talk a little bit more about malfunctioning office supplies.

293
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:45,000
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

294
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,040
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

295
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Sure.

296
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I think I missed it.

297
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I'm sorry.

298
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm sorry.

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I'm sorry.

300
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I'm sorry.

301
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm sorry.

302
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm sorry.

303
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm sorry.

304
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm sorry.

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm sorry.

306
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm sorry.

307
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm sorry.

308
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I'm sorry.

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm sorry.

310
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm sorry.

311
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I think I broke this thing.

312
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,100
Maxine, can you help me out here?

313
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I'm not really a tech guy.

314
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,540
Yeah, sure.

315
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,440
I think it's just out of toner.

316
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,840
You can go use the other one upstairs.

317
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,600
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

318
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,360
Sure.

319
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Damn it!

320
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,560
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

321
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,580
I'll send the stupid fax later.

322
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,460
Oh great!

323
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,140
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

324
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
This is ridiculous!

325
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,340
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

326
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Just take the stairs dude.

327
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
What floor are you going to?

328
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,260
I have to go up 15 floors!

329
00:11:50,260 --> 00:12:01,100
Never mind.

330
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Made it.

331
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:09,100
There's the copier.

332
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,100
No!

333
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:26,980
Alright, so Erica, everything that you touch that's electronic seems to malfunction, right?

334
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,100
This is absolutely true.

335
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,900
I don't know what it is, but you know what, if I turn on a computer it will suddenly get

336
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,660
a virus.

337
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,300
And even if I'm very careful it still breaks.

338
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Right.

339
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

340
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,820
I can relate to that.

341
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,660
But you are much better at computers and technology than I am.

342
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,780
Well, I really, really like them.

343
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,420
And well, I guess even I know a little bit about copy machines or copiers because my

344
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,100
uncles are like copy technicians.

345
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Really?

346
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:06,460
Yeah, so they fix copiers that broke down or they replace toner and they do all that

347
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,460
stuff so that's why I know a little bit about it.

348
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,940
But actually the original term is a Xerox machine.

349
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
Yes, why is that?

350
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
From the brand, right?

351
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Ah, right.

352
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,820
There's a brand called Xerox and Xerox invented and patented this technology of making copies.

353
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,260
Alright well the next time my photocopier explodes I'll call you.

354
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,380
Call my uncles, right?

355
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,740
Alright and well let us know how things in your office break down or if you have any

356
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,060
stories of like Erica that breaks everything she touches.

357
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
It's true.

358
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,780
Alright, so come to our website, come to our comment section and leave your opinions and

359
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,900

360
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
That's right.

361
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,660
You can find us at EnglishPod.com and Marco and I are always around.

362
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,140

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,020
Yep, we will.

364
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,580
Okay guys, thanks for listening and until next time.

365
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
Bye.

366
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:26,760
Bye.
