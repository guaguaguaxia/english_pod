00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,200
My name is Catherine and we're on the road today.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,560
We're traveling a little bit.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
That's right.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,680
Today we have a lesson that was requested by one of our users and I think it's a very

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
handy lesson.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,880
If we're traveling, we are buying tickets at a train station.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
That's right.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
So I personally love traveling by train.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,040
I think it's a very romantic way to see different countries, different places.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,680
We're going to learn all about how to get tickets and how to talk about different parts

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,680
of a train.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,680
So let's first listen to our dialogue.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,480
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Certainly, sir.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,040
This is our train schedule.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,440
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 p.m.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,200
How long does it take to get there?

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,520
About 12 hours.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,720
Do you serve food on a train?

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,440
12 hours is such a long time.

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
Yes, of course.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,700
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,800
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Great.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I'll take it.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Here you are, sir.

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,160
Your train leaves from platform number 9 at 9 on the dot.

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,840
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
might miss your train.

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,200
I understand.

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,320
Thank you very much.

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Have a great trip.

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,480
All right, we're back.

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,640
So now we're going to take a look at a couple of words that we've picked out for you on

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,360
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,400
Language Takeaway.

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,600
So there are many different kinds of tickets you can purchase, you can buy for your train

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,800
journey.

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
The first time we're going to talk about is maybe the fastest.

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
This is called an express train.

46
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
That's right.

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,120
So as the name says, it's an express train.

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,960
That means it's a very fast train.

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,880
And it depends because in different places, sometimes they call it the fast train, sometimes

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,000
they call it the express train.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But basically the idea is that it's a very fast train.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,640
And it's fast usually because it stops very few times.

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,000
For example, if we want to go on the Paris to Berlin train, it won't stop in every single

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
town.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,280
It will probably only stop a couple of times.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Exactly.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,720
So apart from the express trains that usually they'll go in the daytime, we have an overnight

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
train.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,560
Overnight trains are very fun, or at least they can be fun if you have a comfortable

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
place to sleep.

61
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,720
Basically the idea is you get on the train at night and you sleep on the train and you

62
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
get off in the morning.

63
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
That's right.

64
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,120
It's actually a very popular way of traveling, especially if you're on a budget because you're

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,640
basically saving yourself one night of spending the night at a hotel.

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
That's right.

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,200
So you're going to have to find a place to sleep if you're taking the overnight train.

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
There are usually different options.

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,520
The most uncomfortable is usually a seat, like a hard seat.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,680
But there are oftentimes special cars on a train where you can sleep for these overnight

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
trips.

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
What are those called?

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
That's right.

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,360
And those are called sleeper cars or you choose a sleeper seat.

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Right.

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
So that's pretty easy to remember.

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,680
So you choose a sleep sleeper.

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,960
The sleeper seats are the seats that fold back like you're lying down.

79
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,640
But of course most places like China and India and Vietnam for example have actual cars that

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,840
have beds in them.

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Right, right.

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Yeah.

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,760
So you can, as the name says, you can actually sleep on this train.

84
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,260
Now if you're going to buy tickets, you're not going to find a sleeper train on an express

85
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,520
train or a train that travels during the day.

86
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,440
These are only available at night usually.

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
That's right.

88
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,600
So a sleeper car is what you want to look for if you're traveling overnight.

89
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
And in those cases, you oftentimes get hungry.

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
You need to eat.

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
So where do you go to eat?

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
That's right.

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
We're going to look for the dining car on the train.

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Okay.

95
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,440
So think about the word dining room.

96
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,640
Dining room, dining car, this means the place where you eat.

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
That's right.

98
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,200
So we're going to look for a dining car and it's usually in the front of the train I think

99
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,260
and you can just go and get a quick meal over there.

100
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
That's right.

101
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Dining car.

102
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,400
And finally, we have another very important word here.

103
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,760
It's all about getting on and off the train.

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
So where do you do that?

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Well, you go to the platform, the specific platform where your train is leaving.

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,120
So in this case, this guy has to go to platform number nine.

107
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Okay.

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,200
So usually that means that there is a cement or a stone block where you stand.

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,440
The train comes to the station.

110
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,680
People get off, you get on.

111
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,240
So the place where that all happens is the platform.

112
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
That's right.

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,560
And remember that in airplanes or in airports, usually you look for a terminal.

114
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,640
For train stations, you're looking for a platform.

115
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
All right.

116
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,000
And that number is going to be very important.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,040
So look at your ticket and find out which platform your train will be arriving or departing

118
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
from.

119
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
That's right.

120
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay.

121
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,200
So now why don't we review these words.

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,720
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

123
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,320
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Certainly, sir.

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,960
This is our train schedule.

126
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,360
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 p.m.

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
How long does it take to get there?

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
About 12 hours.

129
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,760
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

130
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,000
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,480
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

132
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Do you serve food on a train?

133
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,400
12 hours is such a long time.

134
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes, of course.

135
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,600
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

137
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Great.

138
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll take it.

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Here you are, sir.

140
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,280
Your train leaves from platform number 9 at 9 on the dot.

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you

142
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
might miss your train.

143
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,080
I understand.

144
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,200
Thank you very much.

145
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Have a great trip.

146
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Okay.

147
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:12,400
So we've got some really great phrases today on Fluency Builder, not that many of them

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,720
but they're very useful.

149
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,280
The first one is a kind of ticket you can buy.

150
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
That's right.

151
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,680
We're looking for a one-way ticket to Brussels.

152
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Okay.

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,400
So a one-way ticket means you go to Brussels but you don't come home.

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,300
Maybe you have a flight later or you have a car waiting for you.

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,800
You don't need a return ticket on that train.

156
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,280
One-way ticket is the opposite of a round-trip ticket.

157
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
That's right.

158
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
So usually, for example, if you live in New York and you're going on vacation, you're

159
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,400
going to buy a round-trip ticket because you need to go back to your city.

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
But in this case, we're getting a one-way ticket.

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
So we're just buying a ticket that will only take us there.

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,640
It's not going to bring us back.

163
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Okay.

164
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,960
One-way ticket.

165
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,620
And after that, we have a good question.

166
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,280
This is something we can ask in many, many different situations.

167
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,160
Here the person buying the ticket wants to know how long does it take to get there.

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
He's talking about Brussels.

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
That's right.

170
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,040
So let's take a look at this structure.

171
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,560
We can say how long does it take to and then we can add another verb there.

172
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,540
So for example, we want to know the amount of time it is going to require.

173
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,620
For example, here we are asking how long does it take to get there, in this case to Brussels.

174
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,920
We're asking how much time is needed to go to Brussels, but what if we change the last

175
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
part?

176
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Well, there's anything.

177
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,360
We could say anything here.

178
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,040
We could say how long does it take to bake a pizza?

179
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,880
Or for example, Marco, how long does it take for you to do your hair in the morning?

180
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
Like 20 seconds.

181
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Not very long.

182
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Not very long.

183
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,320
You could even change the name of the place you're going to.

184
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,160
So how long does it take to get to Beijing?

185
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,360
Exactly, so just remember this structure when you want to ask the amount of time needed.

186
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,000
Of course, there are other ways and sometimes it's very common to make a little bit of mistakes

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,280
saying how much time to Beijing or something like this.

188
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Or how many hours.

189
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
We don't really say that in English.

190
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,180
We say how much time.

191
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,400
So how much time does it take?

192
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
All right.

193
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,520
And what about when the person that's selling the ticket said, okay, the train leaves from

194
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,520
platform number nine at nine on the dot?

195
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay, so I'm not really sure where this idea of a dot comes from, but I think it has to

196
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
do with clocks.

197
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,640
So basically when you look at a clock and all of a sudden the hand comes to 12, so it's

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,920
nine o'clock, the hand is on the 12, that is on the dot.

199
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,080
That means exactly.

200
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,660
Okay, so the train is leaving at nine zero zero, not nine 30, not nine 15.

201
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,080
It's leaving exactly at nine o'clock.

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
So we can also say this in normal speech when we're talking to our friends.

203
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,160
I could say, Marco, we're going to leave at six on the dot.

204
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,840
Any later and we'll miss the movie.

205
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Exactly.

206
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,760
But when you say on the dot, you're usually emphasizing that it leaves promptly.

207
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,280
It's not going to be late and you're kind of emphasizing a person to be on time.

208
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,680
Yes, please don't be late because, so nine oh one or in my case, six oh four, these are

209
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
not okay because they're too late.

210
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Exactly.

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
So I'm going to pick you up at four o'clock on the dot.

212
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,920
Usually means I don't really want to wait, so please be ready at four.

213
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,120
All right, so on the dot.

214
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,920
All right, so now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk

215
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,440
with you a little bit more.

216
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:50,640
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

217
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Certainly, sir.

218
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,220
This is our train schedule.

219
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,520
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine

220
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,600
PM.

221
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,360
How long does it take to get there?

222
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,680
About 12 hours.

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,000
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

225
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

226
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,880
Do you serve food on a train?

227
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,680
12 hours is such a long time.

228
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,840
Yes, of course.

229
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,880
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

230
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,040
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

231
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
Great, I'll take it.

232
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,940
Here you are, sir.

233
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,560
Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

234
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
might miss your train.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I understand.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,460
Thank you very much.

238
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,000
Have a great trip.

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,960
All right, so you mentioned you really like to travel on trains.

240
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I do.

241
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,280
Why is that?

242
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,040
Well, I like that trains are kind of slow.

243
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Many trains are slow.

244
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,920
Some trains, as we said, like express trains are faster.

245
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,120
But if you're traveling in a new place, it's a wonderful way to see the country because

246
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
maybe you're going from one city to another city.

247
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,080
Well, it's nice to see what's in between cities.

248
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
So that's why I like to be on trains.

249
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,400
I actually also really enjoy taking the overnight trains because I sometimes get a little bit

250
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,600
uncomfortable if I travel for too long, for example, on an airplane or a car.

251
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,400
So if I fall asleep and I wake up where I wanted to go, it's really nice.

252
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,040
Well, and I think it's nice also to be kind of rolled asleep, you know, lulled asleep

253
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,200
by the train.

254
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,760
Have you had any like very memorable train experiences?

255
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,920
Traveling around, I have met some interesting people and actually they, you know, local

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
people.

257
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
So they start talking to you and really curious because obviously you're a foreigner in their

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,000
country and try to get to know you and maybe even give you a little bit of advice.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,320
And if you don't speak the language, it's even a little bit more interesting because

260
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
you're trying to communicate and you pick up a lot of words.

261
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
That's true.

262
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,200
I actually heard some really interesting stories from people who took the Trans-Siberian Railway

263
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,920
from Beijing to Moscow.

264
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,880
They said the more vodka you drink, the more foreign languages you speak.

265
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,880
So I don't know if any of our users have done that.

266
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,640
You guys should let us know if you have any fun train travel experiences.

267
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
I know Marco certainly has some.

268
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,000
I've got some of my own.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,400
So we'll all have to share on our website, EnglishPod.com.

270
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Right.

271
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,880
And if you have any other questions, we'll see you guys there.

272
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Bye.

273
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:45,940
Bye-bye for now.
