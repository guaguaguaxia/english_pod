00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:13,680
My name is Kathryn and today we have a wild lesson for you at the elementary level.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
That's right.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,880
We are actually going to visit a farm.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,240
So yeah, it's going to be fun.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,840
We're going to see a lot of animals.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,600
And not only that, but we're going to learn a lot of interesting words and phrases in

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
English today.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,760
But before we get started, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-yah, ee-yah-oh.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,920
And on his farm he had a duck, ee-yah, ee-yah-oh.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,200
We're not going to be teaching you this song today.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Don't worry.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,880
You don't have to listen to us sing.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,360
We do have a great word to start us off.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,600
It's called, the word is country.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,440
Okay, so you know country as like the United States.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Mexico.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,160
Mexico, China, etc.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,080
But in this case, we are going out to the country.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,280
Not out of the country, we're going out to the country.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,120
To the country, okay?

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,920
The country, or you might hear, the countryside is a place that's not like a city.

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
So it's the opposite of city.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,960
It means there's lots of grass, it's very natural, there are very, very few houses and

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,100
people, it's very quiet.

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,960
So it's the opposite of a busy city.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
It's the country.

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
You have a lot of animals.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,560
So usually, farms are found on the countryside or at the countryside.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840
In the countryside.

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
So usually farms are found in the countryside.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
That's right.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,400
And I personally am a big fan because it's so quiet and peaceful.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Yeah, very good.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
We can talk about that in a minute.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Let's listen to today's dialogue first and then we'll be back to talk about some of the

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:54,160
words and phrases.

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Isn't this great?

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,280
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
This is very beautiful.

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,560
Though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
That's fine.

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,960
Don't worry about it.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
What was that?

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Relax.

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
It was just a goat.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,440
And that?

51
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,960
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,280
We can milk them later.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
What was that?

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,600
Honey, seriously.

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,880
It's just a sheep.

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Relax.

57
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Relax.

58
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,560
That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
You know what?

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,480
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

61
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,880
I'm going back to the city.

62
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,720
All right, we're back.

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,480
So obviously some people cannot go to the countryside.

64
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
That's right.

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Some people get very, very upset.

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,920
In fact, there was a whole TV show in America that was about city people living in the countryside.

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,640
Let's see if they can do it, right?

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
That's right.

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,680
All right, but before we talk about that, why don't we take a look at four key words

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,480
in language takeaway.

71
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
Language takeaway.

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
The first word is the name of an animal.

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Okay, so you've all heard of cows, but have you heard of goats?

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
A goat.

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
A goat.

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
All right, so a goat is a strange looking animal.

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,360
It's kind of skinny.

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
What do you get from a goat?

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
You can actually drink goat's milk.

80
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,480
Many people like to eat goat's cheese, which is cheese made from goat's milk.

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,440
Okay, so a goat.

82
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,640
We heard the sound that a goat makes, so I think it's pretty clear what a goat is.

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,240
They're very common, as we say, in farms, such as sheep and horses, cows, etc.

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,600
That's right, and normally, when they're in the wild, they like to live in rocky places,

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
like mountains.

86
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,560
Right, that's why they say they're very good climbers, because they don't fall off the

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
mountains.

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,920
All right, and well, if you have cows, then they're probably going to be grazing.

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,840
Okay, so to graze is a verb.

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
It's something we do.

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,880
Well, we people don't do it.

92
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Animals do it.

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,200
It's a way for us to describe how animals, like cows, eat.

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Means to eat grass.

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,560
Okay, so if your cows or horses are grazing, that means they're eating grass somewhere

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
out.

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,800
That's right, they're walking, they stop, they eat some grass, they walk, they stop

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
again.

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
It's a very slow process.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,160
All right, so cows are usually grazing out in the countryside, and well, once they finish

101
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,680
grazing and they get all fat, then in the mornings, you have to milk them.

102
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,280
Okay, so we drink milk.

103
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,600
Milk is a thing, but it's also a verb.

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,040
So to milk something.

105
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,200
All right, and if you milk a cow, is when you extract the milk, the liquid from them.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,680
That's right, so underneath a cow, there's an udder, or underneath a cow, there are udders,

107
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,800
which you have to squeeze with your hands to make the milk come out.

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,960
Okay, an interesting word as well, udder.

109
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,480
It's like that big bag full of milk.

110
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,000
Exactly, so to milk a cow.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,800
All right, and you have cows out in the fields grazing, and probably your horses and donkeys

112
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,280
are going to be in the stable.

113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,880
The stable is a place, okay, so this is something that's often found on farms, where the horses

114
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,160
or the cows live.

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
It's a structure, it's a building for those animals.

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,320
Okay, so they're probably separated in different little rooms or compartments, and that's called

117
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
a stable.

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,440
So as you say, you usually find horses and cows and donkeys in there.

119
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
That's right, so a stable is a way to protect animals from the weather.

120
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
All right, very good.

121
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,520
So four key words there as we just saw.

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:51,560
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be back soon.

123
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Isn't this great?

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,640
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

125
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,960
This is very beautiful, though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,560
That's fine, don't worry about it.

127
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
What was that?

128
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
Relax, it was just a goat.

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
And that?

130
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,440
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

131
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,960
We can milk them later.

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
What was that?

133
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Relax.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,160
Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

136
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
You know what?

137
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

138
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm going back to the city.

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
All right, we're back.

140
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,280
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,360
You know, Marco, I have to confess.

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
I love Fluency Builder.

144
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,440
All right, and that's our first phrase for today.

145
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
I have to confess.

146
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay, so to confess is to tell someone something that's a secret.

147
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,240
So we can confess with a priest.

148
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,360
So we can confess to a priest.

149
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,420
We can confess a secret to a friend.

150
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,040
But I have to confess is a very common phrase.

151
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,720
It's a way for us to start a sentence.

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
I have to confess.

153
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,720
So you're saying I have to be honest with you.

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
I have to tell you the truth.

155
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Exactly.

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
So I have to confess.

157
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm not a huge fan of that sweater.

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,440
So I have to be honest.

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,720
I really don't like your sweater.

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,000
This is a way for us to be more polite when we're saying something that's negative.

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,720
And in this case, it was a girl who was confessing and what she confessed is her second key phrase.

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I don't know the first thing about farming.

163
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,560
Okay, so I don't know anything about farming.

164
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,320
There's another way we could say this or I don't know a thing about farming.

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,720
But I don't know the first thing about farming means I don't even understand what a farm

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
is.

167
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,360
Okay, the first thing is what is a farm?

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,280
I don't even understand what a farm is for.

169
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,160
This is a way for us to say I don't know anything at all about this.

170
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,320
And if we change the noun, right, and we can say for example, I don't know the first thing

171
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,560
about cars.

172
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,560
So I have no idea what models they are or what type of engine they have.

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,960
I don't know the first thing about cars.

174
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
All I know is how to turn them on.

175
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Right.

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Or I don't know the first thing about wines.

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,760
I'd love to learn about wine, but I don't know the first thing about it.

178
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,840
Okay, so it's a phrase that you can use with many, many different nouns, right?

179
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't know the first thing about architecture.

180
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,880
I don't know the first thing about English.

181
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,040
Right, well, we do and that's why we're here to help you.

182
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,560
But this is a really great phrase to describe not understanding anything at all about something.

183
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Right.

184
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,640
So this is a really great way to describe not knowing anything at all about something.

185
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,760
Okay, and well, obviously since she didn't know the first thing about farming, she ended

186
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
up leaving and she said, you know what?

187
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,320
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,200
Okay, so I can hack it, he can't hack it.

189
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,640
We use this with the verb to be able to and it means I don't think I can do this.

190
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
I think this is too hard.

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,960
Or maybe if somebody quit, right, after a week at the office and you can say he couldn't

192
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
hack it.

193
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
He couldn't hack the pressure and he left.

194
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Exactly.

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,000
So that means to handle or to be able to handle or to withstand.

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,920
So I just don't think I can hack the cold.

197
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,800
Right, I can't handle the cold.

198
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
It's too cold here.

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm moving somewhere warm.

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,520
All right, so I'm sure you guys will be able to hack our dialogue one last time.

201
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:39,160
So let's listen to it and we'll be back.

202
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Isn't this great?

203
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,280
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

204
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,560
This is very beautiful, though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

205
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
That's fine.

206
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,960
Don't worry about it.

207
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
What was that?

208
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Relax.

209
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,360
It was just a goat.

210
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,440
And that?

211
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,960
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

212
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,240
We can milk them later.

213
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
What was that?

214
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,160
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

215
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,120
Relax.

216
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Relax.

217
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,520
That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

218
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
You know what?

219
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,480
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

220
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
I'm going back to the city.

221
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,880
All right, we're back.

222
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
So as you said, you're a fan of the countryside and about farming, right?

223
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
That's right.

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,400
Well, I wish I knew more about farming.

225
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't know the first thing about milking a cow, but I do come from a part of the world

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,480
in Illinois near Chicago where we have a lot of farms and I appreciate the quiet and having

227
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,640
animals around and being able to go on long walks without cars and horns and bicycles.

228
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
It is actually a little bit refreshing to be out in the countryside sometimes and not

229
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,360
even have internet or cell phone coverage or anything.

230
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,680
So it's just basically you can't do anything else but relax, read a book, talk to people.

231
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,560
Now an interesting thing about this is a lot of people take for granted the countryside

232
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,000
because I've met many people who live in the city, who grew up in the city and have never

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
seen, for example, a live chicken.

234
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,800
And when they see it, they just freak out and take pictures with the chicken or a cow

235
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
or something.

236
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
It's amazing.

237
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
That's so funny.

238
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
That's really funny.

239
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Well, I think it's very valuable.

240
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,440
I think there are very valuable skills that you learn being out in the countryside like

241
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,000
how to cook for yourself.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,280
There's no one else who can cook for you or how to get food from animals.

243
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,520
Or maybe you can't even use a microwave.

244
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,360
So how do you cook without a microwave or something?

245
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
That's right.

246
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,080
And I think the biggest problem for city people when they come to the countryside is that

247
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
it's dirtier.

248
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,240
You know, you get mud and there are bugs.

249
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,360
And I imagine some of our co-workers here having a very hard time in the countryside.

250
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Yes, indeed.

251
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,000
So why don't you guys come to our website EnglishPod.com.

254
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
It's great.

Can't wait to hear from you.

258
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Happy studies.

259
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Bye everyone.

260
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:38,640
But now I'm confused how he 1999!
