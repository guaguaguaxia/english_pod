00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,840
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,920
My name is Catherine and today we have part two of a very important and very valuable

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,700
series about giving presentations.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,700
That's right.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,760
As you well know, we started this series.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,380
It's a ten-part series and today we're going to talk about sales and charts and graphs

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,180
and more or less explaining maybe a PowerPoint presentation.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,180
That's right.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,880
And some wonderful ways of talking about changes in markets and marketing.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,440
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,960
what you've heard.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,320
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share and this is the case both

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,560
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,640
Well, the answer is simple.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,360
There is a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,680
profit.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,200
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
owners across the globe.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,480
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,880
population.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,760
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,040
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners with figures

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,280
rising to around 4-5%, an increase of 1000% compared with the 1980s.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,960
overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,680
increase in a very short time period.

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,220
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,220
of China.

32
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,100
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,960
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,900
of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

35
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,720
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,040
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,120
some of our key competitors.

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,560
Alright we're back so now let's start with Language Takeaway.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,880
Okay, so in the first part of what Mr. Ford is saying, he mentions something called market

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
share.

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,600
Now Margot, what is market share?

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,920
That's right, everyone is competing for market share and this is basically a small portion

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,880
of your available market.

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,400
So for example, if you sell perfumes, women's perfume, then your market share is maybe women

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,480
who are 18 to 35 years old in your city or in your town or in your country.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
I see.

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,700
Right, so when we're talking about market share because we're sharing a piece of this

49
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,240
big pie, we're going to talk about that in terms of a percentage, so 30% or 15%.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
That's right.

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,000
I think maybe one of the clearest examples is Coca-Cola has I think maybe a 60% market

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,360
share of the carbonated beverages market.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,440
Interesting, so you could say that Apple has a 50% market share of the personal computing

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
industry.

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
That's right.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,980
Very good, so this is what we refer to as market share.

57
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,640
Now as we continue to talk about markets, we have two very interesting words when we

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,440
refer to a developed market and a developing market.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,200
Okay so a developed market is something that has been polished and grown over time.

60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,160
Perhaps we talk about the developed world being Western Europe and America, but then

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,240
we have developing markets and those are markets that are still trying to figure out kind of

62
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,640
what's going on.

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
They're growing.

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,160
They're usually growing much faster than a developed market.

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,240
That's right, so again when we're talking about maybe computers, we consider for example

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,640
the United States a developed market.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,240
Many people already have a computer or express the desire to buy one and so maybe a developing

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,820
market are some of the African countries where they're still growing and so now they're beginning

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,600
to purchase more and more computers.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Okay so developed and developing, two different ways to describe markets.

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
That's right.

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,580
Now after that we hear this phrase cutthroat.

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,640
So someone asks why is this market so cutthroat?

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
What does this mean?

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,400
A cutthroat business or a cutthroat industry.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,160
It means that it's very, very competitive.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,020
Okay so cutthroat, we're actually talking about maybe having a knife and cutting someone

78
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,400
else's throat, but it's just a metaphor.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
It's a way of saying yes, this is very competitive.

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
So you're not actually cutting someone's throat.

81
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,960
Right, everyone is fighting for that market share so it's very cutthroat.

82
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,680
Everyone is fighting very, very hard, but you're not literally killing someone or cutting

83
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
their throats.

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,520
You could even use this to talk about a sporting event.

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,360
You could say it was a cutthroat game.

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
That's right, that's right.

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,520
So anything that's very competitive or very close.

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,720
So to finish off language takeaway when Mr. Ford was towards the end of his presentation,

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,500
he said that the rewards could be very, very big in a very short time frame.

90
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,180
So when we say the word time frame, we mean period of time.

91
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,320
It's not like 2 p.m.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,880
It's like from May to June, we have this short time frame.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,600
It's only 2 months long.

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,200
So time frame is a window or a period.

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
That's right.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,960
So this is what he is referring to is that in a very short period or in this period of

97
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
time, they could make a lot of money, a time frame.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,840
But how long would a long time frame be?

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Maybe a couple of years.

100
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,160
All right, so you can have a short time frame and a long time frame.

101
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
That's right.

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,120
So why don't we take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly with Fluency

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Builder.

104
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,600
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,040
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share and this is the case both

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,560
in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,840
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,920
Well, the answer is simple.

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,600
There is a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
profit.

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,480
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer

112
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,160
owners across the globe.

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,760
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,120
population.

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,000
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,280
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners with figures

117
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:03,540
rising to around 4-5%, an increase of 1000% compared with the 1980s.

118
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,500
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the

119
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,220
overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge

120
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,960
increase in a very short time period.

121
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,480
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
of China.

123
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,360
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,200
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,160
of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,920
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,300
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,480
some of our key competitors.

129
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,040
Alright, we're back.

130
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,760
So now we've picked out a couple of different phrases for you.

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,800
Let's check those out now on Fluency Builder.

132
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,360
Fluency Builder.

133
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
So in today's dialogue, we heard Mr. Ford talk about some numbers.

134
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,600
He's talking about growth and change in the market.

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:16,880
And he says with figures to around 4-5%, we've got an overall increase of 1000%.

136
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
That's right.

137
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,000
So what's a phrase, an increase of?

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Very very common when you're talking about growth of maybe revenue or when you're talking

139
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,120
about the growth of a company or sales for example.

140
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
So it's important to remember here that this is a fixed phrase.

141
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,360
We say an increase of 10% or an increase of 30%.

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,040
But you can use the same phrase with drops in percentages or money.

143
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,000
So you can say a decrease of 10%.

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,240
That means that you go down 10% or a decrease of 100%.

145
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
That's right.

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,280
So a very useful phrase when talking about incrementing someone or as you said, decreasing

147
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,880
it, decrease of 5%.

148
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,040
Now Mr. Ford used a very interesting phrase when referring to the Chinese market.

149
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Obviously it's a very big market.

150
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,840
And he says that the computer ownership stands at around 60 million.

151
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,640
But of course 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare it to the population

152
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
of China.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
That's right.

154
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
So what does this mean?

155
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
It's a big percentage or a small percentage?

156
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Very very small.

157
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
All right.

158
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,520
So what he's saying here is it's like a drop of water in an ocean.

159
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,040
So a drop of water is so small you don't even notice it.

160
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,720
You don't even see it because the ocean is so big.

161
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
And so you can use this in many different ways.

162
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,160
You can say, hey, you know, $5 is just a drop in the ocean.

163
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,640
It's not really important because it's very little money.

164
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
That's right.

165
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
That's right.

166
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,840
So it's sort of like a metaphor saying, you know what, it's very insignificant.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Just a drop of water in an ocean.

168
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,040
It's not really something you can notice.

169
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
That's right.

170
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,920
Just a drop in the ocean.

171
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,200
And now at the very end of today's speech, we heard the phrase to compare and contrast.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,720
So we're talking about the X420 computer brand itself.

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Now what does Mr. Ford mean when he says to compare and contrast?

174
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,040
So when we mention the word compare, we are basically trying to determine how they are

175
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,120
similar in many ways, the characteristics of how they are similar.

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,800
And to contrast is how they are different, right?

177
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
That's right.

178
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
So let's use an example.

179
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,520
Perhaps we could say Pepsi and Coca-Cola.

180
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,240
Let's compare and contrast.

181
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,000
So they're both carbonated beverages.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,920
They are both sweet.

183
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,840
And they're both, they're pretty much the same color.

184
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
That's right.

185
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
And they're also fairly cheap.

186
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,000
They have about the same price.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,360
But I would say that Coca-Cola tastes more like prune.

188
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,540
So that would be a contrasting characteristic of Coca-Cola is that maybe it tastes a little

189
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,600
bit sweeter.

190
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
It does.

191
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
And you could also say it's easier to find Coca-Cola.

192
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,080
Pepsi is less easy to find sometimes.

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
That's right.

194
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Another way that they're different.

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,240
To compare and contrast is to point out how two things are similar and how they're different.

196
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
That's right.

197
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,040
So we've had a lot of interesting phrases there.

198
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,320
I think very useful if you're talking about business and marketing and sales.

199
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:27,480
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time.

200
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,820
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

201
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,360
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share.

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,360
And this is the case both in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing

203
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,800
markets in Asia and Africa.

204
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,040
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

205
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,200
Well, the answer is simple.

206
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,200
There's a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for profit.

207
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,720
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer

208
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,400
owners across the globe.

209
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,880
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world

210
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,360
population.

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,240
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,520
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners with figures

213
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,780
rising to around 4 to 5%, an increase of 1000% compared with the 1980s.

214
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,720
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the

215
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,440
overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge

216
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
increase in a very short time period.

217
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,680
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population

218
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
of China.

219
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,560
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

220
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,400
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions

221
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,360
of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

222
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,560
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

223
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,520
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with

224
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,560
some of our key competitors.

225
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,640
Alright, we're back.

226
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,560
So, as we mentioned, this is just a part of our presentation series.

227
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,960
We're going to keep on talking with Mr. Ford as he discusses business and a lot of other

228
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,320
very interesting and useful skills for talking in public.

229
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
That's right.

230
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,760
And the goal of this series is to help you feel better when you're giving a presentation

231
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
in English.

232
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,600
We all know it's very, very hard to talk in English when you're still learning, but it's

233
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,240
even harder to talk alone, to give a speech or a presentation.

234
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,360
And so the point of this series is to really give you those skills and to help teach you

235
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,440
some of the key phrases and words that you'll be using in your presentations in the future.

236
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
That's right.

237
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,080
So if you have any questions or any doubts, we are always available at EnglishPod.com

238
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
and we'll see everyone there.

239
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Bye.

240
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Bye.

241
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Bye.

242
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Bye.
