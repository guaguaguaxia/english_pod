00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,260
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,260
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,260
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,640
Erica, today we are really excited, right?

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,040
Yeah, we've got a great lesson today, all about real English.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,360
Exactly, English that you hear in movies and TV shows.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,040
Yeah, speaking of movies, today's podcast takes place at the movies.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,440
Exactly, and that's why it's so fun today.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,320
And so before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,960
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,920
In today's vocabulary preview, we have two words.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,200
And the first word is inconsiderate.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Inconsiderate.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Inconsiderate.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,560
So, Erica, what is it when someone is inconsiderate?

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,200
If someone's inconsiderate, they're not thinking about the feelings of other people.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Right.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,240
For example, yesterday, I was on the subway and it was full.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Right.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,800
And an old lady was standing there and no one got up to give her their seat.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,000
That was pretty inconsiderate.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Great.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,200
So now let's take a look at our second word and it's keep it down.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,520
Keep it down.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Keep it down.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Keep it down.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:21,000
So, why don't we listen to some examples on how we use keep it down so we can understand.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,240
Example one.

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Excuse me.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
Do you mind keeping it down?

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,280
It's after midnight.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Okay.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Sorry.

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:43,960
Example two.

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm trying to study.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,880
Do you mind keeping it down?

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,200
Example three.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
You mind keeping it down?

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm trying to watch the game.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,560
So that means be quiet.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Yes.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Don't make so much noise.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,160
I used to hear this one all the time from my mother.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,640
I think we all did when we were children.

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Okay.

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,760
So now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
It's going to be kind of fast.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,000
But don't worry about it if you can't understand everything.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:43,640
By the end of today's lesson, you will understand this dialogue.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,560
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
It's so inconsiderate.

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Don't worry about it.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
It's not such a big deal.

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,300
I can't hear a thing.

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Excuse me.

58
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,760
Can you keep it down?

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Sure.

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,340
Sorry about that.

61
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,520
Someone's phone is ringing.

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,960
Honey, I think it's your phone.

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,000
Did you forget to switch it off?

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh no.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
You're right.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,680
It's so embarrassing.

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
You mind keeping it down?

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,560
I hate it when people's phones ring when I'm watching a movie.

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,360
I think everyone gets kind of angry, but we're going to talk about this a little bit later.

71
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,560
Why don't we take a look now at our language takeaway?

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,780
Language takeaway.

73
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,020
So the language takeaway is our most important words for today's lesson.

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,840
And our first word today is not such a big deal.

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
Not such a big deal.

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
Not such a big deal.

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,360
So when something is not a big deal, it's not a big problem.

78
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
It's not important, right?

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Exactly.

80
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,480
Okay, let's listen to some examples.

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,960
Example one.

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,360
I can't get these files due by tomorrow.

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
It's okay.

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,440
It's not such a big deal.

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,360
Example two.

86
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm really sorry.

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm going to be 10 minutes late for the meeting.

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
It's not such a big deal.

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,020
Peter and Liam are late too.

90
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,800
Now let's look at our second word and it's switch it off.

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Switch it off.

92
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
Switch it off.

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,880
Switch it off.

94
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,200
So this word means to turn it off.

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,520
To turn something off.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,080
Now we can use it in three different ways.

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah, this one is a little bit complicated because it changes a little bit depending

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,240
on how you use it.

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,840
So Marco, I think you've got some examples for us.

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Right.

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,920
So for example, I can say, did you switch off your phone?

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Or you could say, did you switch your phone off?

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Right.

104
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,960
Or simply you can ask, did you switch it off?

105
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
I think this one is a little bit hard.

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,960
Let's look at a couple more examples.

107
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Okay.

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,640
So I can say, for example, switch off the TV.

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,240
Switch the TV off.

110
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
Or switch it off.

111
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Yeah.

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I think that's a little bit more clear.

113
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Yeah.

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
But you know what?

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,840
We even had trouble with that one, didn't we?

116
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Yeah.

117
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,560
We had to do it a couple of times.

118
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,600
Okay.

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,120
Now let's look at our last word and it's can't hear a thing.

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Can't hear a thing.

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
I can't hear a thing.

122
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Can't hear a thing.

123
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Okay.

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,120
We have some examples for this phrase, so let's listen.

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Example one.

126
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,200
What's going on in there?

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
I don't know.

128
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,680
I can't hear a thing.

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Example two.

130
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
What?

131
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
This music is too loud.

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,040
I can't hear a thing.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,600
So that's like saying, I can't hear.

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Exactly.

136
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I can't hear anything.

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
It's too loud.

138
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Right.

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
So now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

140
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
It's going to be slower.

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,280
This time listen for some of the key words we were explaining.

142
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,240
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

143
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,520
It's so inconsiderate.

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't worry about it.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,560
It's not such a big deal.

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
I can't hear a thing.

147
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,440
Excuse me.

148
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,920
Can you keep it down?

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
Sure.

150
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Sorry about that.

151
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,320
Someone's phone is ringing.

152
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,720
Honey, I think it's your phone.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,960
Did you forget to switch it off?

154
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
Oh no.

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
You're right.

156
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
That's so embarrassing.

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you mind keeping it down?

158
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

159
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Okay, great.

160
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,160
Now with the dialogue slower, it's really understandable.

161
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,080
Yeah, I think you could catch those key words a lot better.

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Perfect.

163
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,160
So now we are ready to look at putting it together.

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,360
Putting it together.

165
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:30,020
So in putting it together, we help you use a great phrase in different ways.

166
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,440
And today's phrase is, do you mind?

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,640
Do you mind?

168
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Do you mind?

169
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,040
Okay, so let's listen to some examples on how you can use this phrase in different situations.

170
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,160
Example one.

171
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,200
Do you mind holding my coat for me?

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,400
Example two.

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,160
Oh, I forgot my wallet.

174
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,840
Do you mind paying for dinner?

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:11,200
Example three.

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,660
Do you mind turning off your phone?

177
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,960
So this phrase is usually pretty polite.

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,040
I could say to you, Marco, do you mind holding my coat for me?

179
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
And that's really polite.

180
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Yeah.

181
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,120
So would you mind, do you mind are very polite phrases.

182
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,280
But depending on your voice and how you use your tone, it could be a little bit sarcastic,

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
right?

184
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah, it could be a little bit rude if you say, would you mind keeping it down?

185
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Exactly.

186
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Like we heard in our dialogue.

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

188
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
So that's not so polite.

189
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah, exactly.

190
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,880
I mean, in English, you have to be careful because your tone of voice tells the other

191
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
person how you're feeling.

192
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,000
If you're angry, sad, or just like in any other language.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, that's true.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,300
So I mean, using a phrase like, do you mind is a great phrase, but make sure you keep

195
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,040
a positive tone in your voice.

196
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Exactly.

197
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,840
So now that we've talked about all these great things, we can listen to the dialogue a third

198
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:21,200
time, but it'll be at its normal speed.

199
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,120
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

200
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,800
It's so inconsiderate.

201
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Don't worry about it.

202
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
It's not such a big deal.

203
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
Oh, I can't hear a thing.

204
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Excuse me.

205
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Can you keep it down?

206
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Sure.

207
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Sorry about that.

208
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
Someone's phone is ringing.

209
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Honey, I think it's your phone.

210
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Did you forget to switch it off?

211
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Oh no.

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
You're right.

213
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
That's so embarrassing.

214
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Do you mind keeping it down?

215
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

216
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm sorry.

227
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
I'm sorry.

231
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm sorry.

232
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm sorry.

233
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
So I know that in different countries, there are different habits about watching movies.

248
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Yeah, that's definitely true.

249
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Erica, what's it like in Canada?

250
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Well in Canada, it's really common to eat popcorn and candy and maybe chips while you're

251
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
watching a movie.

252
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,540
But, if your phone rings in the movie theater, this is a big problem.

253
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,360
I imagine it is.

254
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,320
I mean, I would be upset also.

255
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
What about in Ecuador?

256
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Well, in Ecuador and in South America, usually people can bring in food from the outside.

257
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Really?

258
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,680
Yeah, so it's not really uncommon, depending on the city, to find people bringing in chicken

259
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
or some sort of like really smelly food.

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
No way!

261
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,280
So, you get either really hungry or really upset, but that's what happens.

262
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,240
You know, I used to live in Switzerland, and in Switzerland you would have to eat before

263
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,400
you watch the movie.

264
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,000
There was no popcorn, no soda, no candy inside the movie theater.

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Can you imagine that?

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,280
I could not live with that because the whole purpose of going to the movies is to have

267
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,880
some popcorn and relax and have a good time.

268
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,680
You can't have a movie without popcorn.

269
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Exactly.

270
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,560
Okay, so we've talked a lot about how to ask someone to be quiet today, and I hope that

271
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,440
you'll go out and try a few of these phrases in your daily life.

272
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,360
Yes, and I hope also that you visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions

273
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
and comments.

274
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,680
Marco and I are there every day, so we'll be happy to answer your questions, but until

275
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
next time, bye!

276
00:11:31,680 --> 00:12:00,780
Bye!
