00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,560
My name is Catherine and for those of you who have been following, this is the very

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,160
last episode of our 10-part series about giving a presentation in English.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,960
That's right. This is part 10 where we are going to receive questions from the audience.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,520
So this is called a Q&A session or question and answer session. Let's take a listen to

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:34,360
our dialogue. We'll be back in a moment.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Well everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,360
inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks, Michael. Now I'm sure many of you will be

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,960
keen to ask some questions, so I'd like to open up a Q&A session. Please raise your hand

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,920
if you have any questions at all. Yes, Janice, go ahead.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,800
Yes, thank you, Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,360
regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now as you know, Orange has established themselves

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,320
as the market leader in the high-end laptop market. How does Mr. Ford expect to compete

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,840
with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,960
Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question. I think you have hit the nail

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,680
on the head actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,600
power. But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,600
but don't forget who won that contest.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Mr. Ford, could you elaborate on actual technical details of the X420 a little more?

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,480
I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed for time right now. However, Jonathan has

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,960
all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint presentation, which you can look over in your

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,640
own time.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,720
Mr. Ford, one final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:16,640
All right, we're back. So now let's take a look at some words on Language Takeaway.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Language Takeaway.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,240
Well, at the beginning of today's dialogue, Jonathan said, I'm sure many of you will be

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,320
keen to ask some questions. What does this word keen mean?

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,120
All right. So to be keen to do something, which basically means that you want to or

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,640
would like to do something.

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,760
Right. Are you keen? Would you like to do it? Are you interested in doing it?

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,480
Now, this is a very British form of addressing something, right?

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,680
That's right. This is very British. We don't really say this as much in America, but you

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,040
can. People will understand you. I would say, I'm sure many of you would like to ask some

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,600
questions and so you could say that both ways.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,240
That's right. That's right. Okay. So many people want to ask questions and Jonathan

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:11,720
said, so I'd like to open it up to a Q&A session. So the series of words here, to open it up

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,760
to a Q&A session. What does that mean?

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,680
To open it up. It means the discussion. So he would like to invite people to ask questions.

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,200
So I'd like to open it up for questions mean I would like to give you guys the opportunity

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,320
to ask.

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,440
So to open up a discussion or to open up a conversation, right?

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,040
I would like to open this up to you guys.

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,840
Okay. Now, one of the audience members asked about another company, which is their competitors

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,400
and said that they have a huge reputation and huge resources, this competitor. So what

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,620
is this word reputation?

47
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,040
Reputation is important. A person can have a reputation, but a company can also have

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:02,480
a reputation. Now, reputation means the way that other people talk about you. Okay. So

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,400
he has a good reputation means people say good things about him. Or the media like newspapers

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,640
and websites, they say good things about him. But if you have a bad reputation, it means

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,800
people are saying bad things about you.

52
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Right. Okay. So that pretty much sums it up a reputation, what other people say about

53
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,040
you or how other people see you. So maybe if a company like this has a huge reputation,

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,760
it means that it's very well respected and people talk very good thing and people talk

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,280
well about this company.

56
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
That's right.

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Right. Now, another question came along and they wanted to know a little bit more about

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,640
the technical details of this product that they are introducing. And Mr. Ford said that,

59
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,440
you know what, right now we don't really have time, but I'm going to leave all the technical

60
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,280
specs on this PowerPoint presentation and you can look at it later.

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,040
Okay. So specs, this is something you'll hear very, very often, especially in technical

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,400
areas, but it means specifications or details. So maybe I have a computer and I know it's

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,960
an IBM computer, but I don't know the specs. I don't have the details. So that's something

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,440
that you would want to find out if you have a problem or you want to look into it more

65
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,200
closely. And so specs.

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,600
That's right. Okay. So these are the specs. Now, why don't we take a break? Let's take

67
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:35,040
a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

68
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Well everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really

69
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,040
inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks, Michael. Now I'm sure many of you will be

70
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,360
keen to ask some questions. So I'd like to open up a Q and A session. Please raise your

71
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
hand if you have any questions at all. Yes, Janice, go ahead.

72
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,440
Yes. Thank you, Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in

73
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,040
regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now, as you know, Orange has established themselves

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,000
as the market leader in the high-end laptop market. How does Mr. Ford expect to compete

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,480
with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

76
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,640
Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question. I think you have hit the nail

77
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,360
on the head, actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
power. But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,240
in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,

80
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,320
but don't forget who won that contest.

81
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,240
Mr. Ford, could you elaborate on extra technical details of the X420 a little more?

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,120
I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed for time right now. However, Jonathan has

83
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,600
all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint presentation, which you can look over in your

84
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,280
own time.

85
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,320
Mr. Ford, one final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

86
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:18,840
Alright, we're back. So now let's take a look at some of those phrases on Fluency Builder.

87
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,040
The first phrase we have here is one that I really like and I use very often. It's,

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,480
I think you have hit the nail on the head.

89
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,920
That's right. To hit the nail on the head. So this is a very common phrase, which basically

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,440
means I think you got it exactly right.

91
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay. So think about a nail that you're hammering something, you have a hammer in your hand.

92
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,960
It's very easy to miss, but boom, when you hit it, hit the nail on the head, it means

93
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,680
you have it exactly right.

94
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,640
That's right. So this was actually a response to one of the questions because it was a very

95
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,520
good question and it had a valid point. So this is why Mr. Ford said you hit the nail

96
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,160
on the head. This is exactly right. I completely agree with you.

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,920
After that though, we had this interesting phrase. He said, I admit this is a David and

98
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
Goliath battle.

99
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,600
Okay. So now this is obviously, he's speaking metaphorically, right?

100
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,040
That's right. So David and Goliath, that's actually a story that we often talk about.

101
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,320
It's a biblical story, so it comes from Christianity and David and Goliath fought, but David was

102
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,360
very, very small and Goliath was a monster. He was very big. And so everyone said Goliath

103
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,760
will win the fight, but David won the fight. And so this is an example or a story that

104
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,960
people often use when they say, listen, it may be the case that you think the big giants

105
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,600
will win, but actually the small man or our small company will win.

106
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,960
That's right. As you said, we many times make reference to this, even not in the biblical

107
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,700
sense, but it's just the size. Maybe we're a small company, we're going to fight this

108
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,780
big company. So we say it's a David and Goliath battle or even athletes, maybe two boxers.

109
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,440
One is bigger than the other. So they'll say it's a David and Goliath boxing match.

110
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
That's right.

111
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Okay. Now when we got the questions about the technical details of the computer, Mr.

112
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,480
Ford said that we are a little bit pressed for time right now. That's why we can't really

113
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
answer that question.

114
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,320
That's right. And so to be pressed for time means that you don't have a lot of time. You

115
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,000
are in a rush.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,640
That's right. So if you are pressed for time, you don't have too much time. You can't, you're

117
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
in a hurry basically.

118
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,440
So I could say, Hey Marco, can you come here and look at this thing on my computer please?

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm sorry. I'm a little bit pressed for time right now. I'll take a look at it in an hour.

120
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,620
Okay. So those are all of our phrases from Fluency Builder. Let's take another listen

121
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:49,280
to our dialogue and we'll be right back.

122
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Hello everyone. I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really

123
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,280
inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks Michael. Now I'm sure many of you will be

124
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,600
keen to ask some questions. So I'd like to open up a Q and A session. Please raise your

125
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,640
hand if you have any questions at all. Yes, Janice, go ahead.

126
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,720
Yes. Thank you, Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in

127
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,280
regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now, as you know, Orange has established themselves

128
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,240
as the market leader in the high end laptop market. How does Mr. Ford expect to compete

129
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,720
with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

130
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,880
Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question. I think you have hit the nail

131
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,560
on the head actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and

132
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,480
power. But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage

133
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,240
in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,

134
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,240
but don't forget who won that contest. Mr. Ford, could you elaborate on actual technical

135
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,280
details of the X420 a little more? I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed

136
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,560
for time right now. However, Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint

137
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,440
presentation which you can look over in your own time.

138
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Mr. Ford, one final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

139
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,040
Alright so that was part 10 of our 10-part series about presentations. We took a look

140
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,240
at many different aspects where you can take it as an example as we talked about computers

141
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,080
and marketing, but you can more or less have an idea of how a presentation should go and

142
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,240
the type of vocab you can use. That's right, and I think that this particular

143
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,680
dialogue today was very, very useful because a lot of times you're going to have people

144
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,240
asking you questions and filling in details, and so you can use some of these phrases to

145
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,320
help explain exactly what your presentation was about when people do have questions.

146
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,600
That's right. So we hope that you enjoyed this series and we would like to hear from

147
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,400
you if you have any other suggestions about a series of dialogues or a series of lessons

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,760
that we can do. We had one about a job interview, all the steps and everything, how a job interview

149
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,960
would go. We just had a series about presentations, so maybe you can give us some feedback or

150
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,480
some ideas of what you would like to learn. Let us know. Our website is EnglishPod.com.

151
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
