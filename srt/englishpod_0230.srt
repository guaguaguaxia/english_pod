00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,680
My name is Catherine and today we're going outside for our lesson.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
That's right.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,900
Today we are gardening.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,720
We are going to set up our own garden.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,280
Okay, that means growing plants and maybe even food.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,360
So let's take a listen to this dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,800
it.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,200
I've decided to grow my own garden.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
What?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,480
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Oh yeah?

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,400
Tell me then, smarty pants.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,640
How will you go about setting up your garden?

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,560
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds and tools.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,960
What type of tools?

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
You know, the basics.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,320
A rake, shovel, spade and a hoe.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Right.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,760
Well it seems like you have all your bases covered.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
What's next?

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,040
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,800
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila, gardening all done.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,280
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,480
won't rain for the next three months.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,160
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500
So a lot of vocab related to gardening.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,640
We mentioned a lot of tools and we're going to explain a lot of those now on Language

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,560
Takeaway.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Okay, so gardening has some very special tools, like you said, Marco.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,280
The first one is one that I am not, well, it's actually not a tool, it's a part of gardening,

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,640
something that we use to help the plants grow and I really don't like it because it smells

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
bad.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Exactly.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,040
It smells kind of bad and it has a very strong smell and that is called fertilizer.

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,440
Fertilizer.

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,560
So basically, fertilizer is something that you use in your garden to help the plants

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
grow better.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,360
Right, I think it has a lot of vitamins and minerals that the plant needs to grow better,

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,920
faster, stronger.

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Exactly, fertilizer.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,040
Okay, good.

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,280
Well, now we're going to mention four tools that we use in gardening, basic tools.

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,560
The first one being a rake.

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
A rake.

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Rake.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Rake.

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,040
So a rake is actually something that's very common in most houses, especially houses with

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,560
a yard or a garden.

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,840
It's not just a gardening tool, but it is something that has a long handle and we use

53
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,960
it to clear the ground of rocks or leaves.

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,880
Right, so just imagine it's kind of like a big brush for your garden.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
It is.

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
It collects things, right?

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,960
Right, it's like a big brush that's pulling things out of the ground or away from the

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,320
ground, especially in the fall, like October or November when all the leaves fall off.

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,880
Like October or November when all the leaves fall off the trees and you have to take them

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,760
off the grass, you use a rake to pull them.

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,600
So you use a rake to pull them and you also call the action of using a rake, you say,

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
you rake the garden.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,520
To rake, that's right.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
To rake the leaves.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,160
I hate raking the leaves.

66
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Alright, and now the other tool that we have is very common, not only in gardening, but

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
for construction work, for many things.

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
You have a shovel.

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Shovel.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,800
So a shovel is basically a big metal spoon.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,120
And you use it to make a hole in the ground.

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Exactly.

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,040
So, as we say, we use it a lot in gardening to make holes for maybe the plants, but also

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,000
in construction, if you want to make a hole in the ground, things like this, you use a

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
shovel.

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,480
And now a smaller version of the shovel that you use only with your hand, this is called

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
a spade.

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
A spade.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,920
Now this is very small, like you said, and it's actually special because of its shape.

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,280
A spade has a point.

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,400
A shovel is round and a spade has a point.

82
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,440
And what's interesting, Marco, is it's actually very common somewhere else.

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
In cards.

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
That's right, in cards.

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,160
So cards have different shapes.

86
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
One is a heart, one is a diamond.

87
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
One of them is a spade.

88
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,640
So the one that's pointy, that's called a spade, and it's used for digging kind of precision

89
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
holes.

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Right, exactly.

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,880
So you don't want to use a big shovel if you want to make maybe a small hole in the ground,

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,320
you would use a spade.

93
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,600
And now our last tool has kind of a funny spelling.

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,880
It's H-O-E, and it's pronounced hoe.

95
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Hoe.

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,160
So again, this is a tool with a very long handle, and you use it to maybe make the ground

97
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
softer or to turn up the ground.

98
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,520
So when you're first starting to plant a garden, the ground is very hard, very tough, right?

99
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,160
And this is a really important tool for that period because you can basically turn up the

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
ground.

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,200
You're not digging anything, but you're mixing up the dirt a little bit to make it softer.

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,360
Okay, very good.

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,300
So that's when you use this tool.

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,860
It's kind of a dirt or a soil mixer.

105
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,320
You can also pull out those nasty weeds with a hoe.

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,520
Okay, good.

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,400
So four key tools that we've just taken a look at now.

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,120
But now let's move on to two verbs that are basically very important when you're talking

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
about gardening and all this.

110
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
As you mentioned, you talked about mixing the soil.

111
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,620
And in the next line, we see that it says, I'll till the soil.

112
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
To till.

113
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,840
Okay, so basically this is a way of turning up that soil, but you're doing it kind of

114
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,400
in lines, right?

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
So you're mixing up the soil and making it soft.

116
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,520
You're preparing the soil for planting.

117
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,920
And so you till the soil.

118
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Soil of course, in this case, is that dirt.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's earth.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,040
Right, it's earth.

121
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,280
So to till is to prepare it for planting.

122
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Till the soil, that's right.

123
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,340
To till the soil, okay.

124
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,480
And what do we do after the soil has been tilled?

125
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,400
Well then we sow the seeds.

126
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,320
Okay, so seeds are baby plants basically.

127
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,840
And we sow the seeds.

128
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,800
When we sow the seeds, we're putting the seeds into the ground.

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,500
So that's basically planting the seeds.

130
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,960
You can say we plant the seeds or we sow the seeds.

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,920
And the opposite of sowing?

132
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
The opposite of sowing is reaping.

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,880
R-E-A-P, to reap.

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,720
So we actually have a phrase in English.

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,840
This is very, very famous, very common.

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,760
We say, you reap what you sow.

137
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,280
You reap what you sow, that's right.

138
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,640
So you basically collect what you planted and that's kind of what you do in life.

139
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,720
So we say if you haven't planted anything good, you're not going to reap anything good.

140
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Exactly.

141
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,960
It's a very popular phrase.

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400
All right, so we've covered a lot of vocab here.

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:50,240
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

144
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,600
I've decided to grow my own garden.

145
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
What?

146
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,640
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

147
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,200
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

148
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh yeah?

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,840
Tell me then, smarty pants.

150
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,000
How will you go about setting up your garden?

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds, and tools.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What type of tools?

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, the basics.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A rake, shovel, spade, and a hoe.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Right.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,240
Well, it seems like you have all your bases covered.

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
What's next?

158
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

159
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,240
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila, gardening all done.

160
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,680
Well, good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,600
won't rain for the next three months.

162
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,600
All right, we're back and we have four phrases for you on Fluency Builder and we're going

163
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,560
to take a look at those now.

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Fluency Builder.

165
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,240
This first phrase is useful in any conversation, I think, especially if you're trying to impress

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
somebody.

167
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,760
So basically, one person in this dialogue says, you know what, you don't know the first

168
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,840
thing about gardening.

169
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,240
That means you don't know anything about gardening.

170
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,200
And what does he say in response?

171
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
On the contrary.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
On the contrary.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,880
So the contrary means the opposite.

174
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,000
So basically this means the opposite is true.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Right.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,040
You're basically saying, I disagree.

177
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,480
What you are saying is false.

178
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,640
It's actually the opposite.

179
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,320
So maybe I have a feeling, Marco, that it's going to rain tomorrow.

180
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,240
Actually, on the contrary, I saw in the news that it's going to be very sunny tomorrow.

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
Oh, well, that's good news.

182
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,520
So that's a way of maybe politely disagreeing with someone or saying to someone that, well,

183
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,600
you're wrong.

184
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,080
It's actually the opposite of what you're saying.

185
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Okay.

186
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Moving on to our second phrase, it's actually a colloquial way of kind of making fun of

187
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,320
someone when you say, all right, then, smarty pants.

188
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
Okay, smarty pants.

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
Don't think about this too much.

190
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
We're not talking about pants, actually.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,960
But this is a way of saying, okay, if you're so smart, then tell me that.

192
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
It's sarcasm.

193
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
It's sarcasm.

194
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Exactly.

195
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,560
So this person says, oh, actually, I know a lot about gardening.

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,440
And the other person says, oh, really, smarty pants.

197
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,540
So you can actually describe a person in this way.

198
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:14,320
Maybe a person that thinks they know a lot or sometimes what you say, a Mr. Know-it-all.

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,040
You also say, it's a smarty pants.

200
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Right.

201
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,880
A person that thinks they know a lot or everything even.

202
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Right.

203
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,920
Mr. Know-it-all or a smarty pants.

204
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
All right.

205
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,160
And our third phrase is interesting because we have a setup here.

206
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,880
When the person says, how will you go about setting up your garden?

207
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Right.

208
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay.

209
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
So to go about doing something.

210
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
There's two important parts of this.

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,520
So Marco, the first part is how you go about.

212
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
This means how you do.

213
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Right.

214
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,200
So you can say, how will you do this?

215
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
What's your approach?

216
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
What's your approach?

217
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,120
So how will you go about plus and then the verb in ing.

218
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,800
So how will you go about setting up your garden?

219
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,880
How will you start or what is your approach to creating your garden?

220
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,720
So maybe Marco, you want to write a book and I can ask you, well, how will you go about

221
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,240
starting your book?

222
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Right.

223
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,760
Or if I'm writing a book, you can say, how will you go about investigating for your book?

224
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,560
So what is the approach you're going to take?

225
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,640
How will you do it?

226
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,600
How do you plan on, how do you plan on doing something?

227
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,640
Exactly.

228
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,520
And our final phrase here is a very commonly used for all sorts of situations.

229
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,000
Basically if a person is prepared, you say, well, you have all your bases covered.

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is a great phrase.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It comes right from sports.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,560
Very common in English to have sports phrases.

234
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
This comes from the sport baseball.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,880
So in baseball, the field is a diamond.

237
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,800
There are four corners or four bases and the runners have to go from one base to the other

238
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
one, two, three, four, and then they get a point.

239
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
But in this case we're saying the other team, they have their bases covered.

240
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,520
That means they're protecting their bases.

241
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,640
And in speech we say, if you have your bases covered, like you said, Marco, you're very

242
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
well prepared.

243
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Right.

244
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,880
So you're, you're ready, you're prepared.

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,960
You have really planned out and thought of what you're going to do.

246
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,000
So you have all your bases covered.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,960
So Marco, for example, you just told me that it's going to be sunny tomorrow, but I think

248
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,240
it still might rain.

249
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,960
So to have all my bases covered, I'm going to bring an umbrella anyway.

250
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Just in case.

251
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Just in case.

252
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,880
Or maybe you have a presentation at work and you've prepared your PowerPoint presentation.

253
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,720
You have your, your drawings, your copies, you have everything ready.

254
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,280
You have all your bases covered for that meeting.

255
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
That's right.

256
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Okay.

257
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,320
So why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back

258
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:47,160
to talk a little bit more.

259
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
I've decided to grow my own garden.

260
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
What?

261
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,560
You don't know the first thing about gardening.

262
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,880
On the contrary, I've been reading a lot of books about the subject.

263
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Oh yeah?

264
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,760
Tell me then, smarty pants.

265
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,960
How will you go about setting up your garden?

266
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,920
Well, first I need to buy some things such as fertilizer, seeds and tools.

267
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
What type of tools?

268
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
You know, the basics.

269
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,920
A rake, shovel, spade and a hoe.

270
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Right.

271
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,080
Well it seems like you have all your bases covered.

272
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
What's next?

273
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,360
I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds.

274
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,480
I'll then add some fertilizer and voila, gardening all done.

275
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,600
Well good luck with your garden, especially considering we're in the dry season and it

276
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,880
won't rain for the next three months.

277
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:36,920
All right, we're back.

278
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,760
So gardening is actually a very popular thing in many countries.

279
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,360
I know many people as well who prefer to have their own personal garden to grow their own

280
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,320
vegetables which they say taste a lot different from the ones you buy at the supermarket.

281
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
They do.

282
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,560
I think personally that home grown vegetables, so vegetables that you grow yourself, tend

283
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,040
to taste a lot better than the ones you get in the grocery store.

284
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
They also look different.

285
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,840
They're not as pretty, but that's because they have less chemicals.

286
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,120
I think it's a very popular thing and well not only gardening your own vegetables but

287
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,840
some people just enjoy it as a hobby to have some plants and different types of things

288
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
in their backyard.

289
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,080
Yeah, many people say it's very relaxing.

290
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,880
You get to go outside, you're in the sunshine, it's a very calming activity.

291
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
It seems like it's very relaxing.

292
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,080
A little bit boring at times.

293
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,560
Basically you're waiting for your plants to grow, but I imagine that once they do, you've

294
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,160
accomplished it, it must be great to see that you've actually brought life.

295
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I'm sure.

296
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Like 20 minutes every day is not so bad.

297
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Yeah.

298
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,480
It's actually a very interesting hobby and we want to know if in your country, in your

299
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,840
town, do you have enough space for a garden?

300
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,200
Do you like gardening or maybe growing your own food?

301
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,520
I think that's a very interesting topic.

302
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,680
Yeah, let us know what you think.

303
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Do you do this?

304
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,960
Yeah, I do.

305
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,720
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

306
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
We hope to see you there.

307
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
All right.

308
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Bye.

309
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:22,860
Have a nice time.
