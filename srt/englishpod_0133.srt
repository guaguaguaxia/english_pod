00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,240
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,120
And my name is Kathryn and today we're talking about being clean.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Yeah, we're going to be doing the laundry, right?

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,360
It's a very important part of everyone's weekly schedule.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,080
And not only important, but I find it to be a little bit difficult because, you know,

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,920
like washing machine and what clothes you should mix with what, you know, how much detergent

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
and how long.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,560
It's such a complicated process.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,920
Well, let's say this, it might not be difficult, but it's very easy to mess up.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Exactly.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Yeah, that's the problem.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,840
It's very easy to like just ruin your favorite t-shirt if you don't do laundry correctly.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,000
Or all of your white socks turn pink, for example.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,720
So we're going to be looking at a lot of vocabulary and phrases related to this topic.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,280
And before we get started with the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,720
Okay, so central to all of these phrases and words that we're going to be hearing is a

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,760
thing, an electric thing that helps us wash our clothes.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
Right, a washing machine.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,680
Right, pretty simple, right?

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,360
So washing is to wash, washing and machine.

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,040
So they go together, washing machine.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Right.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,720
So it's easy now, you just put all your clothes in this thing and it washes it for you.

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,240
Now, you know, a lot of people don't like to use washing machines.

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,040
They say it doesn't really clean the clothes as well as doing it by hand.

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Really?

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,320
Well, I'd say most clothes get washed pretty well with a washing machine.

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,560
But if you have those hard to get stains or some dirt, maybe it's good to have a washing

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
board.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
A washing board, yeah.

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,720
Yeah, where you can really scrub it yourself.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,600
And well, funny you mentioned that word stain because it's our second word that we're going

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
to preview, a stain.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,360
Right, a stain is some color, maybe some food or wine or grass that you can't remove from

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
your clothes.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Right.

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
So it's very common.

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,560
You're having a nice dinner and all of a sudden you spill wine on your shirt.

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,360
So you have a wine stain.

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
I hate that.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,480
And you can also have stain on your, you can also have a stain on your carpet, right?

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,200
So if you spill some coffee on your carpet, it's got a little circle that's brown forever.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,360
Right?

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Or even some people have stained the teeth, right?

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
That's right.

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
So you can get them turned back white with a little money to your dentist.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Exactly.

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,600
So those are the two words that we're going to be looking at today in Vocabulary Preview.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,680
So let's listen to our dialogue.

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's see what's happening with these people that are doing laundry.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,680
Okay, let's go through this one more time.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,880
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,560
I know, I know.

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

59
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,360
So I had to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,520
so-called washing machine.

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Right.

62
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,160
You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing.

63
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,200
For example, for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle.

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,620
Also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

65
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,840
So complicated.

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Okay.

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,900
What about this red wine stain?

68
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,520
How do I get it out?

69
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,460
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
do the trick.

71
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Cool.

72
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,200
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
No.

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,920
Since you're washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,480
for 20 minutes.

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
You know what?

77
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,400
I'll just have everything dry cleaned.

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:43,760
Okay, so we've got someone who is maybe doing the laundry for the first time and he's not

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,520
really understanding the instructions he's got.

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
Well, that's the thing I tell you.

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,560
It's a little bit difficult and well, it's very tedious at times to try and do laundry

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
like this.

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Well, the first thing that's maybe tedious about it is that you have to really worry

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,160
about what colors go together.

85
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Right.

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,080
So let's take a look at those words that were related to doing laundry now in Language Takeaway.

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Language Takeaway.

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:16,280
Okay, the first word we have is actually related to a joke we made earlier about pink socks.

89
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,760
So if you change the color of something, you're dying it.

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,080
Okay, die.

91
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,720
So it's pronounced exactly the same way as, you know, to die, to not live anymore.

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,860
Die.

93
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,520
But it's spelled differently.

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
D-Y-E.

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,640
Okay, so it can be a verb or an adjective.

96
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Or an noun.

97
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Or a noun.

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,200
So something that you put on clothes to change the color is called a dye.

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
A dye.

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,520
But to do this, to change the color of some clothes is to dye the clothes.

101
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,720
So that's maybe what happens when you wash a red t-shirt with all your white t-shirts.

102
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,680
Then you have dyed shirts.

103
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,360
You have pink shirts and...

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
And also women, when they go to the beauty salon, they dye their hair.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Exactly.

106
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,920
So to change the color of your hair, it means it's a long-term change.

107
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
It's not short.

108
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
It's not like one day.

109
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,320
It means probably for a long time.

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
So that's the correct word, to dye.

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Very different.

112
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,280
Maybe some people say to paint, which, you know, we understand, but the correct form

113
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,080
would be to dye.

114
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,480
And next we have a word that describes a certain kind of clothing.

115
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
We're not talking about pants or socks.

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
We're talking about delicates.

117
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Delicates.

118
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,440
So now this adjective, delicate, which means it's very... easy to break.

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Fragile, right?

120
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,320
But this is a noun, delicates.

121
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Right.

122
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,840
So you think of something that's easy to break or to ruin, maybe you think of underwear.

123
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Underwear.

124
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,360
You know, underwear is something you wear under your clothing and so it's generally

125
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,440
not as strong as a shirt or a pair of jeans.

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,320
And so we call these in English delicates.

127
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Very good.

128
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,120
So you have to be careful when you're washing your delicates because it's happened to me

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
before.

130
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,920
You know, you come in with all the clothes and then you have stretched out boxers or

131
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
something like that.

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Yeah.

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,520
So that's why many women, I know, wash delicates by hand.

134
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,320
So you separate the clothes from the delicates.

135
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Very good.

136
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,960
And now if you're washing delicates or you're washing towels or t-shirts, it's always a

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,320
good idea to use fabric softener.

138
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,000
All right, fabric softener.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
What are these two words?

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
One of them you understand already.

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,880
Maybe it's soft, softener.

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
So it makes it soft.

143
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah.

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Something that makes something softer.

145
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
We've got fabric softener.

146
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,680
It's something that makes the clothes that you wash softer.

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,520
So fabric is any type of material, right?

148
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Like a textile.

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Yeah.

150
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,680
So it could be cotton or silk or nylon, linen.

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,720
So these are all kinds of fabrics.

152
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,400
So you pour a little bit of this in your washing machine and your clothes come out really nice

153
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
and soft.

154
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,760
It feels nice just talking about it.

155
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
All right.

156
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,560
And well, also to wash your clothes, to actually make them clean, you use detergent.

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Right.

158
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,040
So many people might want to say the word soap because soap is what we use to wash our

159
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,400
hands and our dishes.

160
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,880
But here we have detergent.

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,600
So this is a special soap for your clothes.

162
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Right.

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Laundry detergent.

164
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Yeah.

165
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
You could just say laundry.

166
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,640
You could say laundry detergent or simply detergent.

167
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,560
And now in order to remove those nasty stains that maybe are very hard, you would use a

168
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,120
chemical called bleach.

169
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
All right.

170
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,120
So bleach is the dangerous chemical because it smells very strong.

171
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Right.

172
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,600
And it can change the color of your clothes to white or yellow.

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,240
So we usually only use bleach with white clothes.

174
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,360
I actually had a friend who changed the color of his hair to white using bleach.

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
He put bleach on his head and on his hair and it just turned white.

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Oh, wow.

177
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,040
So many people do that because they want to go from dark colors to light colors.

178
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,440
And in that case, you wouldn't say, you could say that he dyed his hair white, but usually

179
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,040
you would say he bleached his hair.

180
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
And so we understand that it turned white.

181
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Exactly.

182
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,280
So those five words we just looked at in language takeaway, they're important.

183
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
They're related to doing laundry.

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,480
So before we move on, let's listen to our dialogue again, but a little bit slower.

185
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,200
Okay.

186
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,640
Let's go through this one more time.

187
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,120
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses.

188
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
I know.

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I know.

190
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Okay.

191
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,760
So I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking

192
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,960
contraption so-called washing machine.

193
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,040
Right.

194
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,940
You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing.

195
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,920
For example, for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle.

196
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,560
Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

197
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,280
So complicated.

198
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
Okay.

199
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,960
What about this red wine stain?

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
How do I get it out?

201
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,920
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
do the trick.

203
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Cool.

204
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,320
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

205
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,380
No.

206
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,440
Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and

207
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,920
for 20 minutes.

208
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
You know what?

209
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,560
I'll just have everything dry clean.

210
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,760
So here at EnglishPod, we'd like to also provide you listeners with some phrases that allow

211
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,040
you to increase your fluency.

212
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,600
That means sound more like a native English speaker.

213
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,000
And so today, let's check out these phrases in Fluency Builder.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Fluency Builder.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
All right.

216
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,680
So on Fluency Builder, we're going to be looking at four words or four phrases.

217
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,440
So the first one was really easy when she was telling the guy or instructing him how

218
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,920
to do the laundry, she said, let's go through this one more time.

219
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Go through what?

220
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
The wall?

221
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
No.

222
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,160
So it's not actually to go through an object, like to pass.

223
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,320
So it's let's repeat or let's rehearse again.

224
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Okay.

225
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,040
So normally we say this when there are many different steps to do something.

226
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,400
So let's go through this again.

227
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,560
When you leave work, you go home, you unlock the door, you open the door.

228
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
And then so it means that there's a process.

229
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
There are many steps.

230
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,840
And so let's go through this again is a way for us to say let's think about and discuss

231
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
this process.

232
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Very good.

233
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,120
So we also use it maybe when we're studying.

234
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,840
So let's go through this subject one more time.

235
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,560
Can we go through chapter five again?

236
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
So you would reread a chapter five.

237
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
All right.

238
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,800
So why don't we listen to a couple of more examples of how we could use go through.

239
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Example one.

240
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,320
I want to go through chapter five again before the exam tomorrow.

241
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
Example two.

242
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,200
David, do you have time this afternoon to go over the details of this new project?

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Example three.

244
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:07,040
I went through my contract and it says that I am entitled to 15 vacation days a year.

245
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Now this next phrase is very common when we're using sarcasm, when we're trying to make jokes.

246
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
So we say so-called.

247
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Right.

248
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,000
So she said this so-called contraption.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,240
It's like she doubts that it's really a washing machine.

250
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,760
So I could say her so-called boyfriend wants to go out tonight.

251
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,240
So I say that because he doesn't really act like a boyfriend.

252
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
So you're being sarcastic.

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,440
It's a very good way and easy way of demonstrating sarcasm.

254
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah.

255
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,800
Actually, in the 1990s in America, there was a very famous TV show called My So-Called

256
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Life.

257
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
All right.

258
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,520
So this is my so-called life.

259
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,520
It's almost like it's not really like I have any control over it.

260
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,240
Or I don't really have a life because it's kind of boring.

261
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Yeah.

262
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,920
So my so-called life, not bragging.

263
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
It's a joke.

264
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,400
So you can say my so-called friends, my so-called job.

265
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,720
Basically, you can almost be sarcastic with anything.

266
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah.

267
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,160
But be careful that you know that it's a joke because if you're trying to be serious, you

268
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,680
might make some people angry.

269
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Right.

270
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,720
And now, well, she was explaining the whole process of how to do it.

271
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,000
And when she recommended using bleach, she said that should do the trick.

272
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Trick.

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
So dogs do tricks, right?

274
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Right.

275
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
But to do the trick, right?

276
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
What is she saying?

277
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
So it's got a different meaning.

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
All right.

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,240
So she's basically saying this should work.

280
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,280
This should fix your problem.

281
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
So that should do the trick.

282
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:36,480
So Marco, I've been having this itch on my foot and I just can't seem to figure out what

283
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
to do with it.

284
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Do you have any suggestions?

285
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Yeah.

286
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,240
You should maybe just put some ointment on it and that should do the trick.

287
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
All right.

288
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Cool.

289
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Thanks for the suggestion.

290
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah.

291
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
So very easy.

292
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
It's just a way of saying that should solve your problem.

293
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
All right.

294
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Great.

295
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,520
So that's the trick or it will do the trick.

296
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,800
And well, we have one last phrase, all set.

297
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
All set.

298
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,960
So this is another phrase that has two words that always go together to mean, well, we're

299
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
finished.

300
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,040
We're done.

301
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,120
Everything is ready.

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Everything is ready.

303
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,440
We're all set to go on vacation.

304
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
So my bags are packed.

305
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,520
I have my passports.

306
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,800
We are all set.

307
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
Or after a meeting, you can say, are we all set here?

308
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
That means, are we finished?

309
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,840
Is it time to leave?

310
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Very good.

311
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,520
So we are almost all set.

312
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

313
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,680
Okay.

314
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,320
Let's go through this one more time.

315
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses.

316
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
I know.

317
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
I know.

318
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Okay.

319
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,000
So I had to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,120
so-called washing machine.

321
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Right.

322
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,840
You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing.

323
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,400
For example, for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle.

324
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,280
Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

325
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,560
So complicated.

326
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay.

327
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,580
What about this red wine stain?

328
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,200
How do I get it out?

329
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,120
Since this is a white T-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will

330
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
do the trick.

331
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Cool.

332
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,880
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

333
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
No.

334
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,680
If you're washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for

335
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
20 minutes.

336
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
You know what?

337
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:30,400
I'll just have everything dry cleaned.

338
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
Have you ever had any laundry mishaps?

339
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,720
Have you ever lost a sock, dyed something?

340
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
Have I ever.

341
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
I hate doing the laundry.

342
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Why?

343
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
So much.

344
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
It's time consuming.

345
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,600
It takes a lot of time and I just have no patience.

346
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,560
And so normally, when I was in college, I would take all of my laundry in a bag and

347
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,040
I'd throw it in the washing machine and I'd put it on cold.

348
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Because cold water, it's okay for all colors, but hot water makes the colors bleed.

349
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,320
I took out the clothes and put them in the dryer and afterwards I saw all my clothes

350
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,480
were clean except for my three sweaters, which were small enough for babies.

351
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Oh, you shrunk it.

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,520
I shrunk three brand new sweaters.

353
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,720
The problem that I have when doing laundry is that I forget that I started doing laundry.

354
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,200
So all of a sudden, I'm doing laundry in the morning and then clothes are washed, but they're

355
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,480
still in the washing machine.

356
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,280
And I remember the next day.

357
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,480
So then the clothes are smelling kind of humid.

358
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
Because they're moldy.

359
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,760
So I have to rewash them and it's just a pain.

360
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,920
And doing laundry is sometimes so time consuming, but let us know what you think.

361
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,280
Do you like doing laundry or have you ever lost a sock?

362
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,960
I think everyone has lost a sock or something in the washing, right?

363
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I don't know what happens.

364
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,320
I think there's a secret home for socks somewhere.

365
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
It's so weird.

366
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,760
Maybe it's in Australia or something.

367
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,800
