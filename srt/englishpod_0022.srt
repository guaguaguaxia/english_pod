00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,180
And today we're bringing you the second part of Christmas Chronicles.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,100
Another Christmas lesson to get you in the Christmas spirit.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,920
Christmas and useful language for all of our listeners today.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
That's right.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,800
In today's lesson, we'll be learning some great Christmas vocabulary.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,560
And police-related vocabulary as well.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,400
Now, Christmas, police vocabulary, how exactly does that fit together?

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,760
Well, they don't.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,440
But here at EnglishPod, we can make anything happen.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,080
So that's why we have done this.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
To be creative.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,080
To be creative.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,440
So, let's take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,080
Vocabulary Preview.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,360
In today's vocabulary preview, we've got two words from our dialogue that you will need

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,940
to know to understand this dialogue.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,120
The first one is elves.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Elves.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Elves.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Elves.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,240
And this is the plural of the word elf.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
Elf, right.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,080
So elves are?

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,560
Little people.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,280
Little people with pointy hats?

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
With pointy hats.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
Sense is helpers.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Okay.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
So elves.

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Elves.

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
Our next word is candy cane.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,840
Candy cane.

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,080
Candy cane.

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Candy cane.

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,920
So a candy cane is a traditional Christmas candy, right?

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Yes.

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
It's red and white.

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,440
And it kind of shaped like a J?

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Like a J, yeah.

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Okay.

44
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
It's very traditional.

45
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,360
Yeah, you hang them on the tree and you eat them at Christmas time.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Yes.

47
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Tastes like peppermint.

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,960
Okay, well, I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

49
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000
And it's going to be kind of fast, but...

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,460
Don't worry if you don't understand everything because we'll come back and talk about some

51
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,460
of the language later.

52
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,460
Santa Claus is coming straight to the dinner table.

53
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Santa Claus is coming straight to the dinner table.

54
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
Santa Claus is coming straight to the dinner table.

55
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,440
Santa Claus is coming straight to the dinner table.

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Really, fellas?

57
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
You can't take me to jail.

58
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,680
Don't you know who I am?

59
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Kris Kringle, you know?

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Papa Noel, PÃ¨re Noel, Baba Natale.

61
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Shungudan no Chant.

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Yeah, yeah, we've heard that one before, haven't we, Joe?

63
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,240
Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

64
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Can you believe that?

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,120
It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver.

66
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Where's your Christmas spirit?

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,320
What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their

68
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
stockings?

69
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Sorry, buddy, you're parked in a no-parking zone.

70
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,200
You were speeding and you have no ID.

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,800
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh's been impounded and those reindeer

72
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
were taken to the city zoo.

73
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
What?

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,720
This is unbelievable.

75
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,200
What's this world coming to?

76
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,920
Christmas is ruined.

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,000
What's that up ahead?

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It looks like...

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Elves!

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Whoa, they're shooting candy canes!

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mayday, mayday!

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We're under heavy attack!

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We need backup!

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:13,680
Okay, so Santa has escaped from the police car.

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Hooray!

86
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Thank God!

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,080
It's like a war over there.

88
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,760
They were really firing everything.

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,720
I know, I mean, those elves are...

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Aggressive.

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
Very aggressive.

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
Okay, well, we can take a look at some great vocabulary from this dialogue.

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,820
Why don't we start with our language takeaway for today?

94
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,760
Language takeaway.

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,160
In today's language takeaway, we have five really important words that we hope you will

96
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,760
take away from the lesson.

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,360
Exactly, and the first word that we have today is booked.

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Booked.

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Booked.

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Booked.

101
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Booked is another way of saying...

102
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Arrested.

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Arrested.

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah, it's a slang word, hey?

105
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
It's kind of slang, yeah.

106
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Yeah.

107
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
It's a slang word, booked.

108
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Okay, next word, speeding.

109
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Speeding.

110
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Speeding.

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Speeding.

112
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,800
So, Santa was speeding because he was...

113
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Going too fast.

114
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Driving too fast, yeah.

115
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Okay.

116
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Going over the speed limit.

117
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Exactly.

118
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Third word today is...

119
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Impounded.

120
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Impounded.

121
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Impounded.

122
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,560
That's when your car gets arrested.

123
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,200
Your car gets arrested.

124
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,400
Yeah, they take your car to car jail.

125
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, so my car is in car jail.

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think I understand.

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's impounded.

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay, so the police take my car and I have to...

129
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,800
Pay to get it out.

130
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Okay.

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Let's move to our next word, ruined.

132
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Ruined.

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Ruined.

134
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Ruined.

135
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,680
We have a few examples for us to listen to, to understand the meaning of this word.

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,320
Example one.

137
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
It's been raining for five days.

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Our vacation is ruined.

139
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,200
Example two.

140
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,560
Look at this hole.

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,280
You've ruined my favorite pair of jeans.

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Example three.

143
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Sam, you've been caught stealing from the company.

144
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,280
Your chances for a promotion are ruined.

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,480
Okay, great examples and basically ruined means...

146
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Destroyed.

147
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Destroyed.

148
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Yeah, messed up.

149
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Messed up.

150
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Okay.

151
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,880
So, our next word, backup.

152
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Backup.

153
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,720
So, now for our last word.

154
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,320
Okay, so now for our last word and language takeaway, backup.

155
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Backup.

156
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Backup.

157
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Backup.

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
So, backup is...

159
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Help.

160
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Help.

161
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Right?

163
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
So, when you call for backup, you call for help.

164
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,280
Yeah, you see it all the time in war movies, police, call for backup.

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah.

166
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Right?

167
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,160
So, important to point out that here, the pronunciation and stress of this phrase is

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,760
really important, hey?

169
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Yes, yes.

170
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
You have to say backup.

171
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Backup.

172
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Backup.

173
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Yeah.

174
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,840
So, both words are stressed at about the same level, hey?

175
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Backup.

176
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,300
Because if you were to say back up...

177
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,120
That means to move back.

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Exactly.

179
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Yeah, it's different.

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
So, backup, backup.

181
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
Yes, the stress is important.

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
The stress.

183
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
All right.

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Well, you know what?

185
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,800
With those words in mind, it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:43,880
Really, fellas, you can't take me to jail.

187
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,120
Don't you know who I am?

188
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Kris Kringle, you know?

189
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,960
Papa Noel, Parent Noel, Baba Natale, Shonda Lawrent.

190
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, yeah, we've heard that one before.

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Haven't we, Joe?

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah, last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy.

193
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,480
Can you believe that?

194
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,840
It's Christmas Eve, and I have all these presents to deliver.

195
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
Where's your Christmas spirit?

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,000
What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
stockings?

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Sorry, buddy, you were parked in a no-parking zone.

199
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,000
You were speeding, and you have no ID.

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,480
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh has been impounded, and those reindeer

201
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
were taken to the city zoo.

202
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
What?

203
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,280
This is unbelievable.

204
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,520
What's the world coming to?

205
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,640
Christmas is ruined.

206
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,360
What's that up ahead?

207
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,000
It looks like elves.

208
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,240
Whoa, they're shooting candy canes.

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,620
Mayday, mayday.

210
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,600
We are under heavy attack.

211
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,800
We need backup.

212
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay, so without the sound effects and without any noise, I think it's much more clear now,

213
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
right?

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
A little less dramatic.

215
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
Less dramatic, but good language.

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

217
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,080
Speaking of good language, there's some great phrases I want to look at in this dialogue,

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,880
and so let's do that in Putting It Together.

219
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,760
Putting It Together.

220
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,960
We have two phrases in Putting It Together that we want to show you how you can use in

221
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,860
many different situations.

222
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,080
In the dialogue, we heard this.

223
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,780
Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

224
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,280
Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

225
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,280
So when you claim to be something, you're saying that you are something, but it might

226
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,560
not be true, right?

227
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Right.

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,540
So for example, you can say, this woman claimed to be your wife.

229
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,540
But she's not.

230
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,540
But she's not.

231
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,040
We have a few other examples of how you can use the phrase claim to.

232
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,480
Example one.

233
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Daniel claimed to be the son of a government minister, but later we found out that he was

234
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,820
lying.

235
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,160
Example two.

236
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,520
The criminals claim to have a gun.

237
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Example three.

238
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,200
This man here is claiming to know your father.

239
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
That's such a great phrase.

240
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Just by putting it together with another verb means something different, but still expresses

241
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
that same idea.

242
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Right.

243
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Claim to have.

244
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,000
She claimed to have a baby or something.

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah.

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

248
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So let's move to our next phrase.

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,080
Under heavy.

250
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,800
Under heavy.

251
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,840
Under heavy.

252
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,040
So in the dialogue, they said we're under heavy attack.

253
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Right.

254
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,960
You can also use this phrase in a couple of other ways.

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Example one.

256
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,800
We're under heavy attack.

257
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,880
Example two.

258
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,960
We're under heavy fire.

259
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,720
Example three.

260
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,960
The prime minister is under heavy security.

261
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
So if you're under heavy fire.

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
Means that there's a lot of fire.

263
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Like gunfire.

264
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Gunfire, yeah.

265
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Yeah, not like fire fire.

266
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Yeah.

267
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay.

268
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
And if you're under heavy security.

269
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,400
It means that you have a lot of security, a lot of bodyguards or a lot of.

270
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Right.

271
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,120
Like a prime minister or president would be under heavy security.

272
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Exactly.

273
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Okay.

274
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,280
A couple of great phrases.

275
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,400
Really good phrases and with this, we can listen to our dialogue a third time.

276
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,680
Really, Fuzz, you can't take me to jail.

277
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't you know who I am?

278
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Kris Kringle, you know.

279
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,040
Papa Noel, PÃ¨re Noel, Baba Natale.

280
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,280
Chantant l'Enfant.

281
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,480
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,960
We've heard that one before, haven't we, Joe?

283
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Yeah.

284
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,280
I even book this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

285
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Can you believe that?

286
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,160
It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver.

287
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,080
Where's your Christmas spirit?

288
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,360
What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts in their

289
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
stockings?

290
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
Sorry, buddy, you're parked in a no parking zone.

291
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,640
You were speeding and you have no ID.

292
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,800
Besides that, even if we let you go now, your sleigh's been impounded and those reindeer

293
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,840
were taken to the city zoo.

294
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,560
What?

295
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
This is unbelievable.

296
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,800
What's this world coming to?

297
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,960
Christmas is ruined.

298
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,040
What's that up ahead?

299
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
It looks like elves.

300
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Whoa, they're shooting candy canes.

301
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Mayday, mayday, we're under heavy attack.

302
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
We need backup.

303
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:16,720
So, Marco, the police mentioned something about the tooth fairy.

304
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
The tooth fairy.

305
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know, maybe some of our listeners don't know this story about the tooth fairy.

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
So can I go ahead and say it?

307
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Yes, go ahead.

308
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,760
Okay, well, when you're small and you lose a tooth.

309
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Your baby teeth.

310
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,320
Yeah, you put it underneath your pillow and then you go to sleep.

311
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,100
And then in the night, the tooth fairy comes into the house, flies into the house, sneaks

312
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,280
under your pillow, takes the tooth and puts money there.

313
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I see.

314
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,920
So this is a story that parents tell their kids about what happens to their baby teeth.

315
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,360
And they get money in exchange for it.

316
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Right.

317
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,640
So I guess it takes away the sadness of losing that tooth.

318
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Yeah.

319
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,360
But in South America, for example, we have the tooth mouse.

320
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
The tooth mouse.

321
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Yes.

322
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Okay.

323
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
What is it?

324
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
How does it call them in Spanish?

325
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,720
Oh, well, in some places it's called Ratoncito Perez.

326
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,200
Like it has a last name Perez.

327
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh, really?

328
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,480
In other places, it's just called Ratoncito, which means mouse.

329
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
Okay, so it'd be like tooth fairy Smith.

330
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,080
Yeah, tooth fairy Smith.

331
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
And it's the same thing.

332
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,880
It's a little mouse that comes in and steals a little tooth from you and leaves money in

333
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
exchange.

334
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Cool.

335
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Very cool.

336
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
Yeah.

337
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,320
So we go from Santa Claus to Guns and Wars to the tooth fairy.

338
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Only at EnglishPod.

339
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Exactly.

340
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
All right, guys.

341
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,840

Well, we're out of time.

345
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
We got to go.

346
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
We've got some Christmas shopping to do.

347
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,840
Yes, Christmas shopping.

348
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,760
So we'll see you guys later.

349
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
And until then, it's goodbye.

350
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Goodbye.
