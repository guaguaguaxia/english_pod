00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English Nerds, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,200
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,840
And today we're going to be looking at English slang and informal words used in the 1980s.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,000
So this is the next part of our decades dialogues.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Exactly.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,800
So the 1980s maybe for many of our listeners is a little bit more familiar and there are

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,440
a lot of phrases and a lot of words that were born in this decade and we still use them

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
today.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,400
So we're going to learn those words and phrases in this dialogue.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,720
But before we start, we need to preview a couple of words.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,200
Let's go now to vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,880
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,880
So one of the words that we're going to hear in our dialogue is ride.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,840
Is that your ride?

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Is that your ride?

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
So a ride.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
Normally, we know this word as a verb, right?

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
To ride a bicycle.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,960
In this context, it's an informal way of referring to your car.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,640
So a ride is a car.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,280
Yeah, so I just bought a new ride.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,680
All right, well, maybe you'll take me for a ride in your new ride.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
In your new ride.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
All right.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,440
And we're also going to be looking at this word loaded.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,960
He's loaded.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,440
So if you are loaded.

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
You're really rich.

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,600
You have a lot of money.

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
You are loaded with money.

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,640
So loaded and ride.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,280
Those are two words for vocabulary preview.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,240
And well, let's listen to our 1980s dialogue and see what happens.

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:42,120
Jim, what's up, man?

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,680
Charlie, is that your ride?

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,560
It's butt ugly, dude.

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,960
Don't be an airhead.

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,800
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,440
I just need to fix it up a bit.

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,560
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Not even.

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Check it out.

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,120
Now that's a fresh ride.

46
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,160
Well, too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
He's coming this way.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Be cool.

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Hey, guys.

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,760
What do you think of my automobile?

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,480
Isn't it bad to the bone?

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Word.

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,800
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
in that car.

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
You really think so?

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
For sure.

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Awesome.

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Psyche.

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,920
You totally fell for it.

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,880
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,600
Dude, don't have a cow.

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,480
All right.

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,120
So typical high school students of the decade, right?

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,360
Definitely very, very 80s.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Very 80s.

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,620
And well, of course, you always have the situation with the cool kids and maybe the kids that

69
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,640
are not so cool and well, they're making fun of him, right?

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Yeah, but they use some really cool words.

71
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,320
So let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

72
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,700
All right.

74
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,800
So the first word that we saw in Language Takeaway and was really interesting, this

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,880
word butt ugly.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,320
It's butt ugly.

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,240
That car is butt ugly.

78
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,960
So when something is butt ugly, it's really ugly, right?

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
It's very ugly.

80
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
It's not just ugly.

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
It's very ugly.

82
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,840
And what would butt is like from your bottom.

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,180
From your bottom, yeah.

84
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,880
So he said the car was butt ugly and the other guy answered by saying, hey, don't be an airhead.

85
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,200
An airhead.

86
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,880
Don't be an airhead.

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,720
So an airhead is someone with air in their head.

88
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
In their head.

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
So they're not very smart.

90
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
They've got no brain.

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,360
They've got no brain, right?

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,920
So he said, don't be an airhead.

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Don't be such an idiot.

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,040
All right.

95
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,120
Now for the third word, he described his car as being wicked.

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
It's wicked.

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Wicked.

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
That's wicked.

99
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
It's gonna be wicked.

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Okay.

101
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,080
So this is a very 80s way of saying it's gonna be cool.

102
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah.

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
It's gonna be awesome.

104
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
It's gonna be wicked.

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
All right.

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,680
And now when they saw another car pulling up, a new car, he described it as a fresh

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,840
ride.

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,320
It's a fresh ride.

109
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,080
Now we understand that ride is a car, right?

110
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,640
So a fresh ride.

111
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,240
It's another way of saying cool.

112
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Okay.

113
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,480
So kind of similar, wicked and fresh.

114
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Now finally, at the end of our dialogue, they said, you're a real scumbag, Charlie.

115
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,440
So this word scumbag is interesting.

116
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
You're a scumbag.

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
A scumbag.

118
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah.

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,520
It's interesting and it's still used today, I would say.

120
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Yeah.

121
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,680
So when someone is a scumbag, they're just really not a nice person.

122
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Yeah.

123
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,840
They're not nice or they're not maybe to a certain point, honest.

124
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
They're not kind.

125
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Exactly.

126
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
So you're a scumbag.

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Okay.

128
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
But it's not a very harsh word, right?

129
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,160
It's not harsh to call somebody a scumbag?

130
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,400
Well, it's not like a swear word, but it's certainly not a nice thing to say to someone.

131
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Okay.

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Exactly.

133
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
All right.

134
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,800
So let's listen to all these adjectives that we've just looked at right now again in our

135
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,840
dialogue and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

136
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,200
Jim.

137
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,400
What's up, man?

138
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,360
Charlie, is that your ride?

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,080
It's butt ugly, dude.

140
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Don't be an airhead.

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,600
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,840
I just need to fix it up a bit.

143
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,040
In a couple of months, this baby's going to be wicked.

144
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Not even.

145
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
Check it out.

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,520
Now that's a fresh ride.

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,960
Too bad the driver is a major dweeb.

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,840
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

149
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
He's coming his way.

150
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Be cool.

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Hey, guys.

152
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
What do you think of my automobile?

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
Isn't it bad to the bone?

154
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Word.

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,840
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around

156
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
in that car.

157
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,120
You really think so?

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,520
For sure.

159
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,680
Awesome.

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,780
Psyche.

161
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,980
You totally fell for it.

162
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,840
You are a real scumbag, Charlie.

163
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,720
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,840
Dude, don't have a cow.

165
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Okay.

166
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,760
Well, you know what, Marco?

167
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,360
I love the 80s.

168
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
I love the language of the 80s.

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,040
I love the music of the 80s.

170
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,600
And I'm really loving these phrases from the 80s.

171
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,560
So why don't we look at them now in Fluency Builder?

172
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Fluency Builder.

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
All right.

174
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,120
So on Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at these phrases that you were talking

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
about.

176
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,160
And the first one is very interesting.

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
So these two guys, they were making fun of this other person that was in this nice car

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
and he called him a major dweeb.

179
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
A major dweeb.

180
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,440
He's a major dweeb.

181
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
What a major dweeb.

182
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,280
Now let's break this into two parts first.

183
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Well, let's see what dweeb means.

184
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,520
Well, a dweeb is a very uncool person.

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay.

186
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
So kind of similar to a nerd.

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Yeah.

188
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
A small kind of guy with no power.

189
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Okay.

190
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
He's a dweeb.

191
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
Now, this word major.

192
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,320
It just means big, really serious.

193
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,560
So it's a way of emphasizing, right?

194
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Yeah.

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
And you can say anything.

196
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,000
You can have a major anything like, oh, I've got a major headache.

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Or I can say, I have a major problem this week.

198
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Okay.

199
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,960
So major, a very big problem.

200
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Yep.

201
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,280
Now they're talking about this really cool car and the guy who was a bit of a dweeb,

202
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,800
he said, isn't it bad to the bone?

203
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
Bad to the bone.

204
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,040
It's bad to the bone.

205
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
All right.

206
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,960
Now, this is also part of a famous song, bad to the bone, but what does it mean?

207
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,360
Well, when something is bad to the bone, it's super cool.

208
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,440
It's like, it's so dangerous that it's cool.

209
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Exactly.

210
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,080
It's very, very cool.

211
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
It's bad to the bone.

212
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,200
Now, this is not used anymore.

213
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,720
No, no, no.

214
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,280
Don't walk out of your house and use this phrase tomorrow.

215
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
All right.

216
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,720
So, but it's interesting to know because there is a famous song that has this phrase in it.

217
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,040
So bad to the bone.

218
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
All right.

219
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
So the car was so cool.

220
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,040
It was bad to the bone that all of the ladies would be wanting to get with the driver.

221
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
All right.

222
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,760
So somebody wants to get with you.

223
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,520
He just wants to get with you.

224
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,600
So if you want to get with someone, you want to have sex with them.

225
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Right.

226
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,920
So if you want to get with someone, basically, it means that you want to have sex with them.

227
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,400
But there's another phrase that was used in the dialogue that means pretty much the same

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
thing.

229
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Yeah.

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
To do the nasty.

231
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,840
To do the nasty.

232
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,120
They're doing the nasty.

233
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Okay.

234
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, this was a very popular way of saying it in the 80s.

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,720
It means to have sex as well.

236
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Yeah.

237
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
To do the nasty is a little bit rude, isn't it?

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Yeah.

239
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I think it's a little bit more direct.

240
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Yeah.

241
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,560
If you and your friends are talking and you say, hey, I think that girl wants to get with

242
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,480
you, it's a little bit more casual and less obvious.

243
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Yeah.

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Yes.

245
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,280
Do the nasty is a little bit more rude.

246
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Yeah.

247
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,760
A little bit more direct.

248
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Yeah.

249
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,120
And now the last phrase that we're going to look at today was made famous by the cartoons,

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
The Simpsons.

251
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Mm-hmm.

252
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
And it's don't have a cow.

253
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't have a cow, man.

254
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,360
Don't have a cow.

255
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
So, to not have a cow.

256
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,960
Don't have a cow means?

257
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,680
To get really angry, to freak out, to get upset.

258
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
All right.

259
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,520
So, now we know that you say don't have a cow, but can I say it and use it in the positive?

260
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,240
Can I say, hey, my boss totally had a cow today in the office?

261
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Yeah.

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,920
And it means, again, so it freaked out, got angry, made a big deal of something.

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Okay.

264
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
He had a cow.

265
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Yeah.

266
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,880
So, Frank's going to have a cow when he finds out I smashed his car.

267
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,840
Of course Frank is going to have a cow.

268
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,360
How can you smash his car?

269
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
All right.

270
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,640
But now it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll

271
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,720
come back and talk a little bit more about this decade of the 1980s.

272
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,880
Jim, what's up, man?

273
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,800
Charlie, is that your ride?

274
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,640
It's butt ugly, dude.

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
Don't be an airhead.

276
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,920
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

277
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
I just need to fix it up a bit.

278
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,640
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

279
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Not even.

280
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Check it out.

281
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Now, that's a fresh ride.

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,280
Well, too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

283
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,240
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

284
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
He's coming this way.

285
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Be cool.

286
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Hey, guys.

287
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
What do you think of my automobile?

288
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Isn't it bad to the bone?

289
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Word.

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
in that car.

292
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You really think so?

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
For sure.

294
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Awesome.

295
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Psyche.

296
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,040
You totally fell for it.

297
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,680
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

298
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,000
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Dude, don't have a cow.

300
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Okay.

301
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,920
So, Marco, when I was listening to the dialogue this time, I heard a really cool word.

302
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,120
They said, psyche.

303
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Right.

304
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,600
And this was a very popular thing during the 80s when you would say to somebody, psyche.

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,280
So this is like saying just kidding, right?

306
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Just kidding, right.

307
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,680
So you would say, oh, Eric, I really like your hat.

308
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Oh, thank you.

309
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,320
Psyche, that hat is terrible.

310
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Oh.

311
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Right?

312
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
So that's how you would use it.

313
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,280
You would give somebody a compliment or you would lie to somebody and then tell them,

314
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,640
psyche, and then like tell them the truth like, oh, that hat is terrible or I was just

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
kidding.

316
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Okay.

317
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
So, psyche.

318
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
That was a phrase.

319
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
It was very, very popular and when I was in school, we would use it as well.

320
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,120
We would psych each other out.

321
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,080
So do we still use this phrase today?

322
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,360
I don't think we use it today.

323
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,440
I don't think it's cool anymore.

324
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,080
Well, if you'd use it, it's kind of like you're joking, right?

325
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Yeah.

326
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
And I think it would make people laugh.

327
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,480
Like, you know, it's pretty funny.

328
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Yeah.

329
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
You're joking about how you're a little bit old-fashioned.

330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Exactly.

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

332
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm very sure you would surprise a lot of your native English-speaking friends if you

333
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
use this phrase.

334
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
A good one to try out.

335
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,120
Now, if you have any questions about this phrase or any other of the language, come
