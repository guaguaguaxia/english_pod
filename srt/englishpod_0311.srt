00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,080
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a very important topic.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,960
This is about time.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
That's right.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,120
So sometimes we are a little bit lazy or maybe we sleep too much and we're late to work or

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
a meeting.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
All right.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,420
So learn many different ways to talk about being late today.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,240
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, everyone.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Shall we begin?

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,320
Sorry Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Can we hang on a sec?

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,760
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp and it's now five past.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
So...

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,900
Hi, everyone.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm so sorry I'm late.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
It's raining cats and dogs outside and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Okay, James.

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,640
Take a seat quickly, please.

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Right.

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,320
The subject of the meeting is the importance.

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,560
Hi, guys.

25
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
Please excuse me.

26
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,240
I was held up in traffic.

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,400
Right.

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,000
As I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hi, Maggie.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm terribly sorry.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
The traffic is murder out there.

32
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Sit down, Bruno.

33
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Okay.

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,600
Now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,160
Who would like to start?

36
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,680
All right.

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
We're back.

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,080
So now let's take a look at some of this vocab on Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,460
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,000
So first up, we have a word that we heard.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,400
The phrase was, I did say 11 o'clock sharp.

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Okay.

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,840
So if you say the time, like 11 o'clock, and then you add sharp at the end, what does that

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
mean?

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
That means exactly.

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,840
So, 11 o'clock, exactly 11 o'clock.

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,580
11, zero, zero.

48
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,880
Not 1101, not 1102, but 11 o'clock.

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,640
So if I say, I'll be there at three o'clock sharp.

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
That means you won't be there at 2.58.

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,200
You will not be there at 3.04.

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,820
You'll be there at three o'clock.

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
That's right.

54
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Okay.

55
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
So three o'clock sharp.

56
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,960
So if you say the time and then you add sharp, it means at that exact time.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,880
Now James was late.

58
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,560
He said he was late because he had to wait ages for a taxi.

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay.

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,600
So this might be confusing for some people, Marco, because I can say, what's your age?

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,320
How old are you?

62
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,000
But here, ages has a different meaning.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,200
So I had to wait ages means I waited a very long time.

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
That's right.

65
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,760
So the word ages means for a very long time.

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,920
It's always related to time in this sense.

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Exactly.

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,960
So I could say, Marco, it's so good to see you.

69
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,840
I haven't seen you in ages.

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,400
That means I haven't seen you in such a long time.

71
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Okay.

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Very good.

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,040
And now the next person, Sally came in and she said she was held up in traffic.

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Okay.

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,680
So to be held up in traffic means to be stuck in traffic.

76
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,960
That means you were made late because there were so many cars on the road.

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Okay.

78
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,720
So somebody or something else made you late.

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
That's right.

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
So to be held up means to be made late.

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,820
I could ask you, Marco, why are you so late?

82
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,040
What held you up?

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Exactly.

84
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
What held you up?

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
That means what made me late.

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
That's right.

87
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
It could be many different things.

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Okay.

89
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Yeah.

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
It could be traffic or maybe I could be held up by the doctor.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,920
Maybe he took longer than what I expected.

92
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,400
Or there's no elevator and I'm waiting for the elevator and I got held up by the elevator.

93
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Okay.

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Very good.

95
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,320
And now the importance of being punctual.

96
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,920
That's the topic of the meeting.

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,120
And so what is this word, punctual?

98
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Okay.

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,280
So punctual is an adjective and it describes something as being on time.

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Okay.

101
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,520
So the opposite of this word would be what?

102
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,160
So the opposite would be late.

103
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Late.

104
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Okay.

105
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,280
So she's a very punctual student.

106
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,200
She always comes to class on time.

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,520
She's never late.

108
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Punctual.

109
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,400
So you describe a person as being punctual or not.

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
That's right.

111
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay.

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Very good.

113
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Let's review all this vocab.

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,560
Let's go back and listen to the dialogue again.

115
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,040
Okay, everyone, shall we begin?

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,480
Sorry, Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

117
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Can we hang on a sec?

118
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,880
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp and it's now five past.

119
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
So...

120
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
Hi, everyone.

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm so sorry I'm late.

122
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,960
It's raining cats and dogs outside and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
Okay, James.

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
Take a seat quickly, please.

125
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Right.

126
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
The subject of the meeting is the importance...

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Hi, guys.

128
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,200
Please excuse me.

129
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,280
I was held up in traffic.

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,520
Right.

131
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,800
As I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Hi, Maggie.

133
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm terribly sorry.

134
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,680
The traffic is murder out there.

135
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Sit down, Bruno.

136
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Okay, now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

137
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Who would like to start?

138
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,000
All right.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

140
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Fluency Builder.

141
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,560
We have a lot of really great phrases today that describe...

142
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,920
Well, that are excuses for not being on time or for not being punctual.

143
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,440
The first one we heard was actually different, though.

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,600
One of the students said, can we hang on a sec?

145
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
Hang on a sec.

146
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Okay.

147
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,480
So, if you ask someone to hang on, that means to wait.

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Hang on.

149
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Wait.

150
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Yeah, exactly.

151
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
So, hang on just means to wait.

152
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
It's very casual.

153
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Okay.

154
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,880
So, if you ask someone to hang on a sec, hang on a sec or hang on a minute, that means wait

155
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
for a little while.

156
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A little while.

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,560
A sec, S-E-C, stands for second.

158
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,400
And it's very common in this phrase.

159
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,760
We hear, hang on a sec or wait a sec.

160
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Wait a sec.

161
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Uh-huh.

162
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Okay, very good.

163
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,120
So, it's very casual.

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,240
It's very spoken English, although the word sec doesn't really exist.

165
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,040
It's just a short way of saying a second.

166
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Exactly.

167
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,080
And later on, we heard James come in, he was one of those people that we had to wait for,

168
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,880
and he said, it's raining cats and dogs outside.

169
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
That's right.

170
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Okay.

171
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
It's raining cats and dogs.

172
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
So, are cats and dogs falling from the sky?

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
They are not.

174
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,540
So, this might sound very weird to you.

175
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,360
This does not mean there are cats and dogs falling down from the clouds, but it does

176
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,480
mean that it's raining a lot.

177
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,520
It's raining really hard outside.

178
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
Okay, very good.

179
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,320
So, it's a phrase used to say it's raining a lot.

180
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
It's raining very, very hard.

181
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Raining cats and dogs.

182
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,560
So, Maggie is trying to continue with the meeting as many people keep coming in and

183
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
disrupting her.

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,800
So, she says, right, as I was saying, the subject of the meeting.

185
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
As I was saying.

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,160
Now, this is a really important phrase because you're going to hear this a lot in meetings

187
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,040
or in conversations where someone is distracted.

188
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
So, okay, we're having, oh wait.

189
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
I'm sorry, I have to talk to this person over here.

190
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,680
When you want to come back to what you were talking about, you want to return to the topic,

191
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,640
you say, as I was saying.

192
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,840
That's right.

193
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
As I was saying.

194
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,240
So, maybe you were interrupted, maybe you got distracted and you want to continue talking

195
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,800
about the same topic as I was saying and then you continue talking.

196
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,280
So, you return to the original point you are making.

197
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
Okay, very good.

198
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,720
And well, Bruno was the last guy to come in and he said that traffic is murder out there.

199
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,560
Okay, so murder, to murder means to kill someone.

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,280
But we're not talking about killing people here.

201
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,920
We're talking about an analogy.

202
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,760
We're saying it's as bad as murder.

203
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,520
So, in this case, traffic is murder means traffic is really awful.

204
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
It's really terrible outside.

205
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,000
So, in what other situation or with what other noun instead of traffic can we use this something

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
is murder?

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The wait is murder.

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, that means you have to wait a very, very long time.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
All right, very good.

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
So, now why don't we go back to the dialogue.

213
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's have one last review and we'll be right back.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Okay, everyone, shall we begin?

215
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,120
Sorry, Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

216
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Can we hang on a sec?

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp and it's now five past.

218
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,720
So, hi, everyone.

219
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm so sorry I'm late.

220
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,640
It's raining cats and dogs outside and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

221
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,360
Okay, James, take a seat quickly, please.

222
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,160
Right, the subject of the meeting is the importance.

223
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,360
Hi, guys.

224
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,880
Please excuse me.

225
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,000
I was held up in traffic.

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Right.

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,520
As I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

228
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Hi, Maggie.

229
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,760
I'm terribly sorry.

230
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
The traffic is murder out there.

231
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Sit down, Bruno.

232
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,240
Okay, now.

233
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,400
As you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

234
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Who would like to start?

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,880
So, Marco, are you a punctual person or are you usually late?

236
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,880
For social gatherings, I'm usually pretty punctual.

237
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,320
For work, I'm usually very late.

238
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I've noticed.

239
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,920
You're one of the last people to come in in the morning.

240
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,280
Yeah, usually for work, I arrive late but not like too late.

241
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,520
Some people may even be an hour or two or something.

242
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
A couple minutes, 15 minutes is all right.

243
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,000
But I do hate to wait.

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,520
If we agree to meet up at 2 o'clock and you come in at 2.30, I don't know, let's say to

245
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,320
the movies, then I think that's really irritating.

246
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I agree.

247
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm a very punctual person and I get very annoyed when people are late to meetings or

248
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,960
when people come late to appointments or parties.

249
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,720
And I think it's different in different countries because in many different places, they have

250
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,240
what they call the local time.

251
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,000
So if you say, okay, the meeting is at 9, then everyone assumes that the meeting is

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,240
supposed to start at 9 but then everyone comes in at 9 but grabs a cup of coffee, talks

253
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,720
at the cooler, gets their seat, checks their email and then the meeting will start at 9.30

254
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
instead of 9.

255
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Right.

256
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Or for example, the transportation you will find in different countries can be punctual

257
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
or not punctual.

258
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,760
In Germany, their transportation is very famous for being punctual.

259
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,020
But in India, you will find that the trains are not very punctual.

260
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,720
You might wait one or two or six hours for a train.

261
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Yeah, exactly.

262
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,400
So it's different in different countries.

263
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:54,040
I imagine that in a place like Germany, it would be considered a very bad thing to arrive

264
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,560
late to a meeting, for example.

265
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,160
Yeah, I'm curious about that.

266
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,880
So let us know, is it acceptable in your country to be a little bit late to a meeting or to

267
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,440
an appointment?

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Is punctuality important?

269
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Let us know.

270
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

271
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
All right.

272
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
We'll see you guys there.

273
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Thanks for watching.
