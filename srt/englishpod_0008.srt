00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello English learners and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,360
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,360
How are you, Erica?

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,480
Marco, I'm doing really well today.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
You excited?

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
We've got a great lesson for everyone.

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,520
Yes, we have a really common situation where we're going to use real English, right?

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,040
Yep, everyday English, English that people really use.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,720
And that's what we want you to learn.

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,920
What are we talking about today specifically?

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,840
Today we have a really common situation that is a little bit embarrassing.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
All right, an embarrassing situation.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,600
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be kind of fast.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,540
Yeah, but don't worry if you don't understand everything because after 10 minutes you'll

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,760
understand everything.

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Perfect.

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
All right, let's listen.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:57,920
Nick, how's it going?

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Oh, hey.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,960
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,240
Do you live around here?

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,480
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,040
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,520
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,320
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,120
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,640
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,880
You know what?

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
Can you remind me?

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Sure.

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,120
My name is Anna Farris.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Don't worry about it.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
It happens to me all the time.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,800
I'm terrible with names too.

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,680
Wow, Nick forgot her name.

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,160
Yeah, that's happened to me a couple of times, and I'm going to tell you about it a little

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
bit later.

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
Okay.

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,800
All right, well, let's start with our three language takeaways.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Language takeaway.

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,440
So our first word on our language takeaway is in a bit of a hurry.

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
In a bit of a hurry.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
In a bit of a hurry.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
In a bit of a hurry.

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
So Nick was in a hurry.

50
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,760
Yeah, that's right.

51
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,360
This is a great phrase.

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,440
So let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase.

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,120
Example one.

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Can you drive faster?

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,960
Example two.

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I can't talk right now.

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Example three.

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,280
I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll check these files later.

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,600
Okay, so it's clear now.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,360
Basically it means that you don't have time.

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
You're moving really quickly.

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,200
Okay, perfect.

65
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Now let's look at our second language takeaway word, and it's contact details.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,640
Contact details.

67
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,920
Contact details.

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
So what are your contact details?

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,960
Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card.

70
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,760
All right, so we have like our name, our telephone number.

71
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,720
Your email address, perhaps your mobile phone number.

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,680
So all the useful information so people can get in touch with you.

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah, so people can phone you or email you.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, so contact details.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Great.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay, so our third word is slipped my mind.

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,840
Slipped my mind.

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
Slipped my mind.

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
Slipped my mind.

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,960
So this is a funny phrase.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
It's kind of strange, right?

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,760
Yeah, slipped my mind.

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
It sounds very weird.

84
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Exactly.

85
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,760
Okay, so now we're going to listen to two examples of this phrase.

86
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Try and see if you can figure out what it means.

87
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,280
Example one.

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm sorry I forgot to respond to your email.

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Just slipped my mind.

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Example two.

91
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,360
Don't you know what day it is today?

92
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh, it's your birthday.

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,800
It completely slipped my mind.

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Ah, so slipped my mind is like I forgot.

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
You forgot something.

96
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Uh-huh.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
So, accidentally.

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Right.

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Okay, great.

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,880
Now it's time for putting it together.

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Putting it together.

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,520
All right, Erika, why don't you tell our listeners what putting it together is?

103
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,920
Well, putting it together helps you put language together.

104
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,600
It helps you be more fluent by knowing how words fit together.

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Great.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
So let's look at our first phrase today.

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
And it's around here.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
Around here.

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
Around here.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Around here.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
So this is like close by.

112
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Close by.

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,040
We can say, for example, is there a bank around here?

114
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,400
So that's, is there a bank close to here?

116
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Exactly.

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Now, this phrase, around here, we can change it a little bit and it means something a little

118
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
bit different.

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Right.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,680
I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant right around the corner.

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Right.

122
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,040
And that would mean there is a great restaurant on the other street.

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Yep.

124
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Around the corner.

125
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Yep.

126
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Great.

127
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,920
And another example, we can say around there.

128
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Around there.

129
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Right.

130
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,360
So, for example, I can say, Los Angeles is a great city.

131
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,320
I used to live around there.

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,600
So you used to live near Los Angeles.

133
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Exactly.

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
All right.

135
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,160
It's a really good phrase and it's really common.

136
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Yeah.

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,920
Now, our next phrase in putting it together is terrible with.

138
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,960
Terrible with.

139
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,240
Terrible with.

140
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Terrible with.

141
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,600
And I have a couple of examples that will show you how this phrase works.

142
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Example one.

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,520
You're terrible with numbers.

144
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,240
You can't even remember your own telephone number.

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,480
Example two.

146
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
I'm terrible with directions.

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm always getting lost.

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
Example three.

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm terrible with faces.

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
I can never remember what people look like.

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,800
Wow.

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,120
I understand that.

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,480
I'm also terrible with numbers.

154
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,600
I can barely add two plus two.

155
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,800
Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is a numbers person.

156
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm terrible with faces.

157
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,640
I sometimes forget what people look like.

158
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Really?

159
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Yeah.

160
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Uh-oh.

161
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,360
I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue a second time.

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,680
OK, this time the dialogue will be a little bit slower.

163
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Right.

164
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,320
So try and listen for some of the words we've just talked about.

165
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,200
Nick, how's it going?

166
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, hey.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,440
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

168
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,520
Do you live around here?

169
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

170
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,920
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

171
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,120
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

172
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

173
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,360
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

174
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,120
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

175
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
Sure.

176
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,800
You still have my contact details, right?

177
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
You know what?

178
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,440
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

179
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,280
Can you remind me?

180
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,460
Sure.

181
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,680
My name is Anna Faris.

182
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
Don't worry about it.

183
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,080
It happens to me all the time.

184
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm terrible with names too.

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,540
So it's more clear now.

186
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,360
You can understand a lot better, right?

187
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah, that's true.

188
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Great.

189
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,880
Now, it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

190
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,040
Fluency Builder.

191
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,480
So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases and show you how you can be

192
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440
more fluent or how you can...

193
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Sound more native.

194
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Yeah.

195
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Great.

196
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
In the beginning of the dialogue, Anna said, Nick, how's it going?

197
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,840
Yeah, this is a great phrase.

198
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,140
It sounds really, really natural.

199
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,920
You know, sometimes I hear students say, how are you?

200
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Or, how are you doing?

201
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,840
Those are two great phrases, but this one sounds really, really natural.

202
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,760
It just sounds more casual.

203
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,840
Yeah, let's listen again to that phrase from the dialogue.

204
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,760
How's it going?

205
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,360
How's it going?

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,640
Great.

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,120
So next time that you find a friend on the street, you can just say, hey, how's it going?

208
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Yeah.

209
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,400
So Marco, have you ever forgotten someone's name?

210
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times.

211
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,960
And actually, the most embarrassing situation was that I forgot a family member's name.

212
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,720
No, a family member's name.

213
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,160
We had like a family reunion and there were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins that

214
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
I hadn't seen in a while.

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,240
And I just forgot one of my uncle's names.

216
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
And I was...

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Uh-oh, that's pretty embarrassing.

218
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Yeah.

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
So what did you do?

220
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins.

221
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm like, hey, who is that guy?

222
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,000
He's like, oh, that's Uncle John.

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,440
I'm like, oh man, I totally forgot.

224
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Yeah.

225
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,960
So it was really embarrassing because I didn't know what to call him.

226
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,080
So I just called him Uncle because I didn't know his name.

227
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Hi, Uncle.

228
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah.

229
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Oh, yeah.

230
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,680
So when that happens to me, when I'm in a business setting, sometimes what I do is I

231
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,480
ask for someone's card.

232
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah, that's the good technique.

233
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Yeah.

234
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,680
Or sometimes I might ask them to write down their email because usually their full name

235
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,160
is spelled in their email address.

236
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,760
So that's my trick when I've forgotten someone's name.

237
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
That's a good trick.

238
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,480
And I guess a lot of our listeners can take your advice on that.

239
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Okay.

240
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,040
So I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue one more time, this time at natural

241
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
speed.

242
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,960
Nick, how's it going?

243
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Oh, hey.

244
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,040
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

245
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
Do you live around here?

246
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

247
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,520
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

248
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,960
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

249
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,560
It was really interesting.

251
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,360
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

252
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,160
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

253
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Sure.

254
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,680
You still have my contact details, right?

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,920
You know what?

256
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,400
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

257
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,960
Can you remind me?

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Sure.

259
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
My name is Anna Farris.

260
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Don't worry about it.

261
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,720
You say this to me all the time.

262
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm terrible with names too.

263
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Well, I hope that you've all enjoyed our lesson for today, and remember to check out

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,360

268

So now it's time for us to say...

270
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Goodbye.

271
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Goodbye.
