00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,440
My name is Catherine and we've got another lesson in our series about small talk today.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
That's right.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,920
Today we are at the office again and we're going to be talking very briefly about something,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,080
a business meeting that we're going to have soon.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
That's right.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
So let's check out our dialogue.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,640
We'll be back in a moment.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm Michelle.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,440
Hi, I was hoping to see you.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,440
How have you been?

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
How's the family?

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,520
Oh, hello, Mr. Campbell.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,740
I'm fine and Jack's doing well.

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
How are you?

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,740
I'm fine.

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
Thanks.

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,740
I got your report this morning.

20
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,740
Thanks for that.

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,960
Are you joining the conference today?

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,200
Yes, I'm leaving at 4 p.m.

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Good.

24
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,680
Well, we can discuss this more then.

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,320
But I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,560
Yes, me too.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference.

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,320
I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,920
No, me neither. It's far too expensive.

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,120
Well, let's discuss this more at the conference. Maybe we can share a taxi there?

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Yeah, sure.

32
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:17,520
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,700
Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,720
Today in Language Takeaway we have a number of phrases and words about business. The first

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,120
one we have is, are you joining the conference today?

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,920
That's right. So we're going to go to a conference, actually, which is a little bit different

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
than a meeting.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,920
That's right. A meeting is something you normally do with people at your own company. But a

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,320
conference is when people from many different companies meet.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,440
That's right. And also, I think you don't really have too much input at a conference.

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,640
You mostly listen to other people speak about a topic or a subject.

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right. And I think these are normally held in conference centers or hotels. You

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,120
have a nice lunch. So they're pretty big deals.

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,120
That's right. All right, so it's more of a formal business conference that we're going

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,280
to. And well, they're actually going to discuss different aspects of the company as well,

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,520
especially the figures.

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:19,080
All right. So in the context of business, the word figure actually means number. Okay,

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,380
so we can say the sales numbers for this year are a kind of figure.

49
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,760
That's right. So we're talking about money, basically, when we're talking about numbers.

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,120
That's right. So when the figures look good, it means that our income, our revenue, this

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
looks good.

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,040
That's right. And when we usually talk about income or revenue, we usually have to separate

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,160
it into time. And here in the dialogue, we're talking about a quarter.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,160
All right, so quarter, Q-U, quarter, is a period of time, very common in business, that

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
is a quarter of the year. So three months.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Three months, that's right.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,520
January, February, March, April, May, June, and so on.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,800
That's right. So you have four quarters. And that's actually what, that's why you call

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,780
it a quarter because it's one fourth.

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,960
So we can say the figures for the first quarter were very good, but unfortunately, the figures

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,840
for the second quarter were very bad.

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,640
That's right. And actually, another similar way that you use quarter is the 25 cent coin.

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
It's called a quarter because it's a quarter of a dollar.

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,880
That's right. And if you're in America, you know that it has an eagle, a bird on one side

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
of it.

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,360
That's right. All right, so we are taking a look at the figures for the quarter. And

67
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
they're saying, well, it's not looking too good because we need to talk about the advertising

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
budget.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,520
All right. So this is something that you think is very important. It's budget. It's how much

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,120
money you have to spend on something. And in this case, you're spending it on advertising.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,480
So this is ads that you make.

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,360
That's right. So as you said, a budget is the amount of money that you have available

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,960
to spend on something. And on this occasion, we're talking about advertising. Now, you

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,440
can have a budget for different things, right?

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,200
You could have a marketing budget.

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,880
So the money you have for marketing.

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,720
You could have a personnel budget, which is the money you would set aside for people.

78
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,080
So how much you pay your employees. Right. So you can pretty much mix up many different

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,960
nouns with budget. Even you can have a budget for your home. How much you spend at home.

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,520
That's right. So many people have this for their families. They say this month I will

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,160
spend $100 on shopping and $200 on shoes.

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,800
So it's like a family budget, you would call it.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,120
That's right. Okay. So that's all the words we have for you on language takeaway. Let's

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,640
review everything quickly and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:05:00,200
Ah, Michelle. Hi. I was hoping to see you. How have you been? How's the family?

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,920
Oh, hello, Mr. Campbell. I'm fine and Jack's doing well. How are you?

87
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm fine. Thanks. I got your report this morning. Thanks for that. Are you joining the conference

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
today?

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,640
Yes, I'm leaving at 4 p.m.

90
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,120
Good. Well, we can discuss this more then. But I think the figures are looking very good

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
for this quarter.

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,200
Yes, me too.

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference. I don't think we should

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,640
continue with the TV advertising.

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,080
No, me neither. It's far too expensive.

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,800
Well, let's discuss this more at the conference. Maybe we can share a taxi there.

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,960
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,320
Alright, in today's Fluency Builder, we have a number of phrases you could use in a small

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,400
talk situation. The first one's a question. How's the family?

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,120
How's the family? Now, it's how apostrophe s the family, right? So how is the family

101
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,080
would be the extended way of saying it.

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
That's right. But this is a short way to say it. It's very common. And you normally say

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,440
this with people who are a little bit older, people who have kids. So I haven't seen you

104
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,120
in a long time, Marco, and I know you have some kids and I can say, how's the family?

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,360
How's the family? That's right. And it's actually, it may seem strange the way that this sentence

106
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,480
is made, but it's very, very much similar to how are you? You have how to be and you

107
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
in the subject.

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,000
That's right. And this is a very polite way to say hi. How are you? How is your family?

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
How is the wife?

110
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,360
How's the wife? And she said, well, you know what? Everything is great. I'm fine. And Jack's,

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,280
I guess that's her husband, is doing well.

112
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Jack is doing well. So doing well, thanks. This means good. Okay. But you know, when

113
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,840
we say the answer to this question, how are you? I'm well. That's the correct answer.

114
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm good is not correct.

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,400
Right. So if somebody says, how are you? You can say, I'm well. Or you can say, I'm doing

116
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,520
well.

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,560
That's a positive answer. Things are going well. You could say, not so well. That's not

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,160
a, not, not, not good things are happening.

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Very good. And it's very important to point out the difference. As Catherine said, you

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,400
don't, you don't, you shouldn't use good. I'm doing good or I'm good.

121
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,760
Yeah, no, it's incorrect because good is an adjective and we're, we're looking for an

122
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,440
adverb here.

123
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
That's right.

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Well.

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,720
That's correct. All right. And to finish things off, Mr. Campbell and Michelle were headed,

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,080
headed the same way. So they decided to share a taxi.

127
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,200
That's right. So to share a taxi means two people or three people will pay for one taxi

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,480
together. So maybe Marco, I see you on the street and I know that you have to go to a

129
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,840
conference. I'm going to the same conference. Let's share a taxi. It will cost less.

130
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,320
That's right. So you will share the cost between all the people in the cab. Now there's another

131
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,800
way of saying it as well. More common, I think in the, in the United States.

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,360
That's right. We say split a taxi. Let's split a cab.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,760
Split a cab. Now remember that it's a taxi cab. So sometimes people just don't say taxi.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,820
They say a cab. Let's split a cab. Let's share a cab.

135
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,520
That's right. Cab, taxi, both are okay.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,520
All right. Very good. Good stuff. Let's listen to everything one last time.

137
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:30,040
Ah, Michelle. Hi. I was hoping to see you. How have you been? How's the family?

138
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Oh, hello, Mr. Campbell. I'm fine and Jack's doing well. How are you?

139
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm fine. Thanks. I got your report this morning. Thanks for that. Are you joining the conference

140
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,840
today? Yes, I'm leaving at 4 p.m.

141
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,160
Good. Well, we can discuss this more then. But I think the figures are looking very good

142
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,240
for this quarter. Yes, me too.

143
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference. I don't think we should

144
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,840
continue with the TV advertising. No, me neither. It's far too expensive.

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,120
Well, let's discuss this more at the conference. Maybe we can share a taxi there?

146
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes, sure. All right. So we're getting towards the end

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,360
of our Small Talk series. As you can see, we are taking a look at different quick but

148
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,400
very useful dialogues that you can have with someone, a small conversation, whether about

149
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,800
business, family, whatever. That's right. And in today's dialogue, we

150
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,680
heard two people who probably know each other talking. So sometimes you're with people who

151
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,800
are strangers, you don't know what to say to them. You can listen to our other episodes

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,000
on Small Talk for things to talk about with those people.

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,240
That's right. And of course, if you have any questions or comments, you can visit us at

154
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,200
EnglishPod.com. We hope to see you all there. Until next

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
time. Bye.

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Bye.
