00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,660
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,680
My name is Catherine and today we're going to be helping you set up an answering machine

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
basically.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
That's right.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,920
So somebody's calling you, you can't answer the phone so you leave a message and we're

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,240
going to teach you all about that today.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
That's right.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,480
So let's take a listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to figure out just

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,120
what's going on.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,280
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,000
I just got this service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Sure.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,880
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,840
information so you can call them back.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Okay.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,240
So I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,600
I will call you later.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
So leave me your name and number.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,920
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Okay.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,460
So how about this?

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,000
This is Abby and I'm really happy you called.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,720
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,200
So please leave me your name and number.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Talk to you soon.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,920
A little too friendly, Abby.

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Just say this.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
Hi, you've reached Abby.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number,

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
I will get back to you as soon as possible.

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Thanks.

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,960
That's perfect.

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,640
Can you say that again and record it for me?

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,480
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,960
So now let's take a look at some language takeaway.

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Language takeaway.

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,880
All right.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,440
In the first sentence, we are asking someone to help me set up my voicemail message.

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,040
So we got two key words there.

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
That's right.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
So let's break it up.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,560
The first one is a phrasal verb, to set up.

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Okay.

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,480
You can set a lot of things up, but just remember that set and up, these are the two words that

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
go together.

47
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
In this case, we're setting up voicemail.

48
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,040
It means to establish or to start or to put together.

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,360
Yeah, to install.

50
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,680
Like for example, you get a new computer and you have to connect all the cables and you

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
have to connect the monitor.

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,120
So you say, can you help me set up my computer?

53
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
That's right.

54
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
So he always helps me set it up.

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,760
So my computer, for example.

56
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
That's right.

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,460
And what we're setting up is our voicemail message.

58
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,680
So what exactly is voicemail?

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,080
Well you know what mail is.

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,400
We have email and regular mail.

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,040
Voicemail is the kind of message you receive on your phone, your cell phone or your home

62
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,960
phone when you don't answer the phone.

63
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
That's right.

64
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,100
So basically a way for people to leave you a message even though you can't answer them.

65
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
That's right.

66
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,040
So this is something that's, it's not text, it's actually a voice.

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,800
So that's why it's called voicemail and you have to set it up.

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay.

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,760
So there's, there's no automatic voicemail message.

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,600
You actually have to make your own or you can choose one.

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
And today we're making our own.

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
That's right.

73
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,680
And so we're explaining that we actually just got this service and we don't really know

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
what we're supposed to say or how to set up our voicemail.

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
That's right.

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,160
So voicemail messages are a kind of service.

77
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,200
And now who would offer this kind of service, Marco?

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Probably your telephone company.

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
That's right.

80
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,040
So a telephone company will offer many different services and these are things that you can

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,640
pay extra for and they're useful.

82
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
They can help you in some way.

83
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,160
So another kind of service is three-way calling.

84
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Right.

85
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
That's right.

86
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,920
So actually we're taking a look at this word service as a noun.

87
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,600
So we have a service or this service.

88
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,320
So the company offers this service.

89
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,640
And well, why are we setting up the voicemail?

90
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,880
And our friend explains that we just basically doing it to let the caller know who they called.

91
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Okay.

92
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,120
So if I call a number and it says, Hey, leave a message.

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,520
I don't know who I'm leaving a message for.

94
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,800
Did I dial the wrong number?

95
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
What do I say?

96
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Do I say my phone number?

97
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,760
So this is basically instructions for what to say.

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
That's right.

99
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
And you become the caller.

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Right.

101
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,680
So whoever is making the call is called the caller.

102
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,800
And this is why we are setting up our voicemail to let the caller know who we are calling.

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,920
And of course we have to ask the caller for their contact information.

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
All right.

105
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,160
Now this is important because it's not just something you have with voicemail messages.

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
You have contact information for many different things.

107
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,360
For example, your medical care, your school, you have to include contact information.

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
Now this would be your phone number, your address and or your email.

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
That's right.

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,000
So your contact information is not only useful for in a voicemail message, but for example,

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,880
in a business meeting or a business lunch, you want to get maybe someone else's contact

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,640
information so you can call them later.

113
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
That's right.

114
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,860
So don't forget, it's also your name as well.

115
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,560
So I forgot to mention that.

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
That's right.

117
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,920
Contact information must have your name.

118
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
All right.

119
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,120
So that's pretty much all we have for the first part of language takeaway.

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:07,080
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

121
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,240
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,960
I just got the service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

123
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Sure.

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,880
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact

125
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
information so you can call them back.

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Okay.

127
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
So I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,580
I will call you later.

129
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,520
So leave me your name and number.

130
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,920
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

131
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Okay.

132
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,440
So how about this?

133
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,920
This is Abby and I'm really happy you called.

134
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,680
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.

135
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,180
So please leave me your name and number.

136
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,440
Talk to you soon.

137
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,880
A little too friendly, Abby.

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Just say this.

139
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Hi, you've reached Abby.

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number,

141
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I will get back to you as soon as possible.

142
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Thanks.

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
That's perfect.

144
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,840
Can you say that again and record it for me?

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,640
All right, here we are in Fluency Builder and the first phrase we've got is, how about

146
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
this?

147
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,600
So we're saying, we've got an example for you.

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
How about this?

149
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
That's right.

150
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Then the example.

151
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,360
So we've talked about how about many times already.

152
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,200
So for example, how about we go to the movies or how not to say how about your weekend because

153
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,640
that's completely wrong.

154
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,360
In this occasion, we're talking about how about this and this is like setting it up

155
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
for an example.

156
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
That's right.

157
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,480
So for another example, we could say, so Marco, I'm trying to figure out how to say hello

158
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,600
when I answer the phone because I don't like the way I say it now.

159
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,840
I can say, how about this?

160
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Hello?

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Is that good?

162
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
No?

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
That's all right.

164
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
That's right.

165
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Hello.

166
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
That's too strong.

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Yeah, that's good.

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
All right.

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
So basically I'm setting up an example.

170
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm saying, okay, keep listening.

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
I will give you an example.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Just imagine that you're trying on different clothes and someone is giving you their opinion.

174
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,040
So maybe you try on a black shirt and you say, how about this one?

175
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Eh, boring.

176
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,920
And then you try on a green one and you say, now how about this?

177
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Better.

178
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Right.

179
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,040
So then you're giving them other options and examples and this is why we say, how about

180
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
this?

181
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,120
And then we give the example like Abby did.

182
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,000
And you're also asking for a response.

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,200
You're asking for an opinion.

184
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,360
And so what Abby's saying is, I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,800
Now this phrase, give you a ring is very British English, but it's also something you should

186
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,280
know if you want to be in America because you'll hear it in TV and stuff.

187
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
That's right.

188
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,120
It's actually a colloquial term for saying, I will call you.

189
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I will call you.

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,480
I will call you back or I will give you a call.

191
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,520
So the telephone rings.

192
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,960
That's the verb that goes with the phone, right?

193
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Ring ring.

194
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,180
So I will give you a ring means I will call you just like you just said, Marco.

195
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
That's right.

196
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,640
So remember this phrase.

197
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,960
It's actually, it may seem a little bit confusing, but remember it has to do with calling someone.

198
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
I will give you a ring is I will call you.

199
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,760
Or if you say, hey, give me a ring later on this afternoon.

200
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
It's call me later this afternoon.

201
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
All right.

202
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,840
And then moving towards the end of the dialogue, Abby says, hi, you have reached Abby.

203
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Okay.

204
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,680
This is weird because she is Abby, but she's saying you have reached Abby, right?

205
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,840
You're speaking about yourself in the third person.

206
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
That's right.

207
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
So this is a message.

208
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,000
So you're telling people what to do.

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,960
Like I said, they're instructions.

210
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,240
And so this is basically the first thing you say, you have reached Catherine.

211
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,280
That means the number you dialed is Catherine's phone number, right?

212
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,080
So you reached, that means that you've contacted.

213
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Right.

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Exactly.

215
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,200
So as you said, it's important if you ever call a bank or in, or any type of company,

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,280
it will say you have reached a Wells Fargo bank or something, and it'll give you, it'll

217
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,160
tell you what number you called because maybe you put in your finger wrong and you just

218
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
called the wrong number.

219
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
That's right.

220
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
Or you could use the word reached in a different way.

221
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,360
For example, yesterday I was very angry at Marco because I couldn't reach him by phone.

222
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,160
I called and called and called and couldn't reach him.

223
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,320
And I realized then his phone is broken.

224
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
That's right.

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,480
So actually this verb to reach someone also has to do with, with, in general with calling.

226
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,840
I was trying to reach you all afternoon, but I couldn't get a hold of you.

227
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
That's right.

228
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
And I was so frustrated.

229
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Well, actually, if I had voicemail, I would continue by saying, I am unable to answer

230
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,960
your call right now because maybe my phone is off.

231
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
Maybe I am busy.

232
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,160
So we say, I am unable to answer your call right now.

233
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
All right.

234
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Now this seems really long.

235
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Okay.

236
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,720
It's a little bit strange, but this is basically the standard for how to record a message.

237
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm unable to answer your call right now.

238
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,760
So you answer the phone, right?

239
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,480
Or you answer a phone call.

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,520
But in this case, I'm unable to, that means I can't talk to you for whatever reason.

241
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm out of the house.

242
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm busy.

243
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,520
So I'm unable to answer your call right now.

244
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,960
Just remember that that means I can't talk to you right now.

245
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
I can't be on the phone.

246
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,520
And actually this word unable sounds a lot more polite and a lot more formal than saying

247
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I can't.

248
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
That's right.

249
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,400
And that's why we use it on messages like this because it is so polite and so nice.

250
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
That's right.

251
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
All right.

252
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
So that's all the time we have for Fluency Builder.

253
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,960
Let's take a listen to our dialogue one last time.

254
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,120
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

255
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
I just got this service.

256
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,840
And I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

257
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Sure.

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,720
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact

259
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
information so you can call them back.

260
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Okay.

261
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,240
So I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

262
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I will call you later.

263
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,340
So leave me your name and number.

264
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,680
That's more or less the idea.

265
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,720
But try something that sounds more friendly.

266
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay.

267
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,280
So how about this?

268
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,800
This is Abby and I'm really happy you called.

269
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,520
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.

270
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,000
So please leave me your name and number.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Talk to you soon.

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,720
A little too friendly, Abby.

273
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Just say this.

274
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,080
Hi, you've reached Abby.

275
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm unable to answer your call right now.

276
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,640
But if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

277
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Thanks.

278
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
That's perfect.

279
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,440
Can you say that again and record it for me?

280
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
All right.

281
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,620
So talking about voicemail, I think in the United States, this is a very, very popular

282
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,040
and almost necessary service.

283
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
That's right.

284
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,360
So in America, if you buy a phone plan, which most people have, that means that you can

285
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,840
use your phone in a certain way.

286
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,960
Like every day you have free nights or you have a thousand minutes per month to talk.

287
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,520
But you sometimes also get these services or you pay extra for them.

288
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,520
And voicemail is very important because people don't text as much in America as they do in

289
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
other countries.

290
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,120
So I know in other places, sometimes you text a message to someone and they receive it and

291
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
okay, it's a message.

292
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,720
But if you don't do that, you actually have to record a message.

293
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,000
Like when I call my parents, they never answer the phone.

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,120
So I always have to leave a voicemail message.

295
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,960
So I say, hi, it's Catherine.

296
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
It's Saturday.

297
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Where are you?

298
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Call me.

299
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Right.

300
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Okay.

301
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,280
So that's that kind of, I think, cultural behavior that we just expect to leave messages

302
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,880
for people in America.

303
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,880
And it's actually interesting because I've been to other countries where they also have

304
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,600
voicemail messages and the service, but people are not as willing to actually leave the message.

305
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,560
So it happened to me.

306
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,680
For example, I call someone, I get their voicemail and I don't leave a message.

307
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
I just hang up.

308
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
And then they have...

309
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
You're bored or you're uncomfortable?

310
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Why?

311
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
I don't know.

312
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,640
Because, you know, if you have a mobile phone, it'll show up anyways that you have a missed

313
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,300
call from this person.

314
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,600
So then I really just, I don't really leave the message anymore.

315
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,560
It's like, okay, you saw that I called you.

316
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Either I'll just call you back later or you'll call me back when you see the missed call.

317
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,000
But yeah, for homes, obviously it's different.

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
You need to leave a message if you call someone.

319
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,840
Although sometimes it can be a bad thing.

320
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,920
I definitely have a friend who loves to leave long messages.

321
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Oh, really?

322
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
Hey, Catherine, it's me.

323
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,400
So it's like Saturday at four o'clock and I was just thinking about calling and I was

324
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,480
going to come over but I decided not to come over.

325
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,160
But then I was thinking maybe I'll just call you instead and I can see that you're not

326
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,600
home, but maybe you're out to dinner.

327
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I remember you saying...

328
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,280
And they just go on and on and on.

329
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,560
You actually, there is an end.

330
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,600
They'll go beep and then it cuts you off.

331
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Right.

332
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
I think it's like 30 seconds or something like this.

333
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,080
So it's very interesting, this whole voicemail thing, especially in the business world as

334
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
well.

335
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,560
Many times people go into a meeting, turn off their phones or put it on silent.

336
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,800
And if you want to reach them or you want to leave a message, you've got to do the voicemail.

337
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,200
Yeah, calls will go right to voicemail so that you don't interrupt the meeting.

338
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Exactly.

339
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
So that's all the time we have for today.
