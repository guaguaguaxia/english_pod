00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,240
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,280
And today we have a very special lesson because we're going to be focusing a little bit more

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
on grammar.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
That's right.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,960
We're going to look today at the difference between past simple and past progressive or

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
sometimes called past continuous.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Exactly.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,600
So, we are going to take a look at these two structures which are a little bit confusing

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,560
at times and we're going to be practicing today.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,040
But before we get started, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,200
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,780
Well, this dialogue is all about telling a story in the past and we're going to hear

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,960
two words in the dialogue that we need to understand the meaning of.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,640
So, the first one, ages.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,080
Ages.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,280
I haven't seen you in ages.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,040
Okay, so if I tell you, I haven't seen you in ages.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Basically you haven't seen me in a really long time.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Okay.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,840
So, it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Yes.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,680
And this word ages, we can use in many different ways like, I've been studying English for

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,200
ages.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Or for example, I can say, I haven't been to the dentist in ages.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Oh, well, guess you better go, huh?

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Right.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,640
So, ages, a very long time.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Yes.

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,360
Now, another phrase, to run into somebody.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,080
So, to run into somebody.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,960
I ran into Matt.

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Okay, so if you ran into Matt the other day.

35
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,040
You met him unexpectedly.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,360
Okay, so you didn't plan to meet, you didn't have a date, you just casually on the street

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
met.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Exactly.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,440
Okay, so I ran into your friend the other day.

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,560
Okay, so two good words.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
We're going to hear both of these in the dialogue.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,560
So why don't we get started with dialogue first time.

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,840
Mike, what's going on man?

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Long time no see.

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Hey Pat.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
How's it going?

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,520
Things are going great.

49
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
It's funny running into you like this.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Small world, huh?

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,600
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Yeah?

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
How's he doing?

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
He's doing well.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Oh yeah?

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,480
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,920
Talking about work and family when all of a sudden Matt saw a mouse run under the chair

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,160
and he completely lost it.

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
He started freaking out and screaming.

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Really?

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,680
Yeah, and the funniest thing was then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
a girl.

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
He should have been there.

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,080
Everyone was staring and laughing.

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
It was hilarious.

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:53,240
All right, very good, so a funny story and as we saw a lot of stuff in the past, right?

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,120
That's right and we're going to look at that in a moment but first we've got lots of exciting

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,360
language to describe when somebody gets really emotional.

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,960
Okay, so why don't we start now with language takeaway.

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,800
Language takeaway.

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
We have four words here.

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,880
Now in the dialogue, the guy in the story lost it.

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,640
So he saw a mouse and he completely lost it.

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,960
To lose it.

76
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Okay, so when you lose something, you lose it.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
What are you losing?

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,680
You're losing control of yourself and your emotion.

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Okay, so you lose your temper maybe.

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Yep.

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,880
So when I lose it, do I just get angry?

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,360
Or upset?

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Or even sad?

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,480
But it's usually a negative feeling.

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Okay, so it's not a good thing to lose it.

86
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,640
No, so for example, when I showed my boss the sales figures, he completely lost it.

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,200
Okay, very good.

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,940
So that's what lose it means and now our second word is very similar but has a little bit

89
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,360
of a difference.

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
That's right.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,440
He started freaking out.

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,040
Okay, so to freak out.

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,680
To freak out.

94
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
Now freak out is very similar to lose it, right?

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah, but why don't we hear an example now of somebody freaking out?

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,360
It's just, no, no.

97
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay, forget it.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Forget it.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
All right, just forget it.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
I don't even want to just, I just want to forget it.

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
I just want to forget it.

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
I don't know.

103
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
I don't know.

104
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Okay, calm down.

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Woo.

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Calm down.

107
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I gotta calm down.

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm so happy.

109
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
I can't even.

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm so happy.

111
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
I gotta calm down.

112
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
I'm so happy.

113
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I can't even express it.

114
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm like, I haven't, have I even finished one sentence?

115
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm like, give me a high five, baby.

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,160
All right, so we heard this person freaking out and basically it could be losing control

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,360
or losing your temper but also in a positive way.

118
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Right.

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,040
So maybe you're really excited about something that's going to happen.

120
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,400
So you're freaking out.

121
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Okay.

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,280
Maybe you're very nervous or you're very excited.

123
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
All right.

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,800
And now moving on to our third word, stare.

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,280
To stare.

126
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
People started to stare.

127
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Staring.

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Okay.

129
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Now, when you stare at someone or at something.

130
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,120
You look at and focus at something for a really long time.

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Okay.

132
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,520
So you are looking at it.

133
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Yeah.

134
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Focusing on it.

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

136
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Longer than usual.

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
All right.

138
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,680
Maybe when we were small, our parents taught us that it's not nice to stare at other people.

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Exactly.

140
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
All right.

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
So we're going to stare.

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,840
And our final word, when Matt saw the mouse, he started shrieking.

143
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,040
All right.

144
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,760
So to shriek.

145
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Shriek.

146
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Shriek.

147
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,520
Very similar to that movie Shrek.

148
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Oh, yeah.

149
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
It sounds quite similar.

150
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
All right.

151
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
But it's different.

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
What does shriek mean?

153
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Well, why don't we listen to an example?

154
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Oh my God.

155
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Holy chingada.

156
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay, so I think shrieking is to shout in a very high pitched voice.

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Exactly.

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
That's to shriek.

159
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Okay.

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,440
So we saw four really great words in language takeaway.

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,520
And why don't we listen now to the dialogue for a second time, a little bit slower.

162
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:35,480
And then we'll come back and look at the differences between simple past and past progressive.

163
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,680
Mike, what's going on, man?

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Long time no see.

165
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Hey, Pat.

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

167
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,080
How's it going?

168
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
Things are going great.

169
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,920
It's funny running into you like this.

170
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,440
Small world, eh?

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,880
You know, just last week, I ran into Matt as well.

172
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Yeah?

173
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,400
How's he doing?

174
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
He's doing well.

175
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,520
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

176
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Oh, yeah?

177
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,440
Talking about work and family, when all of a sudden, Matt's all mouse run under his chair

179
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,960
and he completely lost it.

180
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,360
He started freaking out and screaming.

181
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Really?

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Yeah.

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,760
And the funniest thing was that he jumped on his chair and started shrieking like a

184
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
girl.

185
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
You should have been there.

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
Everyone was staring and laughing.

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
It was hilarious.

188
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:31,280
Okay, so there was a lot of different uses of past tense here in this dialogue, wasn't

189
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
there?

190
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,000
When he was telling a story that happened, he used the past a lot.

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Well, let's now, as promised, look at past simple and past progressive in Grammar Breakdown.

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,680
Grammar Breakdown.

193
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Okay, Marco, before we start our discussion, why don't we hear one example of past simple

194
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,600
and one example of past progressive?

195
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,280
You know, just last week, I ran into Matt as well.

196
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,920
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

197
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,240
Okay, so we heard that just last week, I ran into Matt.

198
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,640
So we discussed what run into means.

199
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
Yep, to meet someone by surprise.

200
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
All right.

201
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
And now this structure is the simple past, right?

202
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Yep.

203
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,320
Now the second example that we heard was, we were talking and catching up.

204
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,840
Okay, so let's look at the difference in meaning here.

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,240
I ran into Matt, happened in the past, right?

206
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,320
Right, simple past.

207
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,680
But one moment in the past.

208
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,480
So the action finished, concluded.

209
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,080
Started and finished all around the same time.

210
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
So it's one simple moment.

211
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Okay.

212
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,960
Now, the other example is in the past progressive.

213
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,600
So the action was happening for a longer period of time.

214
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Yeah.

215
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,800
So let's attach some times to this.

216
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,360
Maybe you ran into Matt at 8.04.

217
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay.

218
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,620
And so the action started at 8.04.

219
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,320
But you were talking and catching up from 8.05 until 9.05.

220
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,400
Okay.

221
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,000
So you were talking for an hour.

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right.

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,720
So it's the past progressive you use when the action is happening for a longer period

224
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
of time.

225
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,560
So to better understand this, let's have another example.

226
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it.

227
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,600
Everyone was staring and laughing.

228
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,400
So as we heard in the example, he saw a mouse run under his chair.

229
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,040
So a quick action that started and finished quickly.

230
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Okay.

231
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,840
He saw the mouse and it ran under the chair.

232
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Yeah.

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,420
Now, the second example we heard was, everyone was staring and laughing.

234
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,920
So maybe this happened over four or five minutes.

235
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Okay.

236
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,120
So people were looking at him and laughing and talking about how he was screaming like

237
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
a girl.

238
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Yes.

239
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay.

240
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,800
So that's the main difference between the simple past and the past progressive.

241
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,280
The amount of time that the action happened.

242
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Yep.

243
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
All right.

244
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,800
Well, now that we understand a little bit more about the past tense, why don't we hear

245
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:25,200
it again in context by listening to the dialogue for a third time.

246
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,420
Mike, what's going on, man?

247
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Long time no see.

248
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Hey, Pat.

249
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Yeah.

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
I haven't seen you in ages.

251
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
How's it going?

252
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,420
Things are going great.

253
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,800
It's funny running into you like this.

254
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Small world, huh?

255
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,240
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

256
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Yeah.

257
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
How's he doing?

258
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
He's doing well.

259
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,800
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

260
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Oh yeah?

261
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,120
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing, talking about work and family

262
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
when all of a sudden Matt saw a mouse run under the chair and he completely lost it.

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,600
He started freaking out and screaming.

264
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Really?

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Yeah.

266
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,280
And the funniest thing was, then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like

267
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
a girl.

268
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
He should have been there.

269
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,700
Everyone was staring and laughing.

270
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
It was hilarious.

271
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Okay.

272
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Perfect.

273
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,560
So now that we understand the words and the grammar behind it, there are some interesting

274
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,720
phrases here that you can use casually with your friends.

275
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Yeah.

276
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,360
There's actually a lot of great sort of meeting and greeting and saying hello language.

277
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,360
So for example, when they met up, since they were old friends, he said, Hey, Pat.

278
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Hey.

279
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Okay.

280
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
So this word, hey.

281
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
It's kind of like hi.

282
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
It's hi, right?

283
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Yep.

284
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,040
So you can use it to get somebody's attention, right?

285
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Like, Hey, I'm over here.

286
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Hey, waiter.

287
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Okay.

288
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Yeah.

289
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
But in this case, like, Hey, how's it going?

290
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Or hi.

291
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Yeah.

292
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
So it's a really friendly and informal way of saying hi.

293
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Okay.

294
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,440
And then he asked, how's it going?

295
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,760
How's it going?

296
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,400
So again, this is a way of saying, how are you?

297
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Yeah.

298
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,520
Marco, what's the correct answer to this greeting?

299
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,080
Well, well, for example, he said, things are going great.

300
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Right.

301
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
You can say, yeah, things are great.

302
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Or I'm doing well.

303
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Yeah.

304
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Or even great.

305
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Great.

306
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah.

307
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
So how's it going?

308
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Oh, it's great.

309
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Yeah.

310
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Right.

311
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,880
Now, another one that we didn't see in the dialogue, but it's very popular is when somebody

312
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
asks, Hey, what's up?

313
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Yeah.

314
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
What's up?

315
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,480
So again, what is the right way to answer this question?

316
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
All right.

317
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,360
So when somebody says, what's up?

318
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,240
You can say, well, not much.

319
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
Or if maybe you have news or something that you want to share, you would say, well, I

320
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,560
just got back from the doctor's office.

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Yeah.

322
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,360
But you wouldn't say, fine, thank you.

323
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,720
Or you wouldn't say, very good.

324
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Or any of these other common answers to what's up.

325
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
That's right.

326
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
It can be a little bit tricky.

327
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Yeah.

328
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,240
So the rule is, the normal thing to say when someone says, hey, what's up?

329
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,600
Is nothing much.

330
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Not much.

331
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Yep.

332
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
All right.

333
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
So interesting ways of greeting casually with people, right?

334
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,960
You wouldn't use this fully with your boss, maybe, or in an office setting.

335
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Yeah.

336
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
More useful with your friends.

337
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Okay.

338
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,600
So if you have any other questions or have any other informal greetings that you would

339
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,400
like to share with us, come to EnglishPod.com.

340
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Yeah.

341
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,040
Marco and I are always around to answer your questions and we look forward to hearing from

342
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
you.

343
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
So until next time.

344
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Bye.

345
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:32,800
Have a great day.
