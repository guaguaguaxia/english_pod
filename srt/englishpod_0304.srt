00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,240
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about someone who's very, very dirty.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,820
That's right and actually not only are we talking about something being dirty but also

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,800
that we want to clean everything.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,760
Okay, so you'll learn how to call someone who likes clean things in English today.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,600
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
This bathroom is a pig's die.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,160
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
What's wrong?

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,560
I just can't stand it.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,040
It's really gross in here.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,160
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery so I cleaned it.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,720
You did what?

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,640
Helen, I know it's gross but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,200
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,640
Are you out of your mind?

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
I can't help myself.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,440
It's just so disgusting in here.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,420
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,160
Just leave it to the cleaners, okay?

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,960
Hang on, I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,760
You're such a neat freak.

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,840
I'm out of here.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Alright we're back.

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,680
So this girl was very much of a neat freak and we're going to take a look at that word

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,360
a little bit later on.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,720
Why don't we go back to the very beginning and take a look at some vocab on Language

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,120
Takeaway.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,400
Language Takeaway

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,000
The first word we have here on Language Takeaway today is pigsty.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
This bathroom is a pigsty.

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,400
Okay, so pigsty is a place where pigs live.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,360
Now this obviously, the bathroom is not really a place where pigs live so if you call something

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,480
a pigsty, you're saying that it's very dirty.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,960
You're saying it's disgusting.

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
It's very, very dirty like a pigsty.

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,920
So actually if you go to a farm and you see where all the pigs are, that is actually called

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
a pigsty.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,200
Right, there's mud and dirt and yeah, that's a pigsty.

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,960
So someone who is very, very dirty, you can also call a pig.

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay, now she was saying that the bathroom is so dirty and it's really gross in here.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,880
Okay, so gross means something is, she doesn't like it.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,240
It's really dirty and you know, makes her uncomfortable.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,920
So something that doesn't taste good, you can say it's gross.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
That's right.

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
So I don't like to eat snake.

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,840
I think eating snake is gross.

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,360
Okay, very good.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,800
So something that is gross is something that's not really nice, maybe it tastes bad or it

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
smells bad, something that is bad in general.

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
That's right.

53
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,320
Okay, so she went on to talk about the toilet seat and that there was a stain on the toilet

54
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
seat.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,400
Okay, a stain is usually a bad thing.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,600
It means that there's a color or a mark that's permanent or maybe can be washed away on something.

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,480
So in this case, the toilet seat has a mark on it.

58
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,840
Maybe it's brown or yellow, but I can also say, I was drinking wine and I spilled the

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,320
wine on my shirt and it left a stain.

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,520
So now there's always this red part on my shirt.

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
It won't go away.

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,960
Okay, so a stain is a mark that usually won't go away.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,480
So then she went on to describe the bathroom as being disgusting.

64
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,520
So I guess this is very similar to gross.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
That's right.

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,880
Something that is gross is usually also disgusting.

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,560
I can say, oh, this food is awful.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,960
It's just disgusting.

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,800
But I can also say in this case, oh, your room is disgusting.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
You need to clean it.

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,080
It's so dirty or bad or unappealing.

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,240
So something that is gross, something that is disgusting is something negative.

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,160
And then we have our keyword and the title of this lesson for today, a neat freak.

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,760
Her friend says, you're such a neat freak.

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
That's right.

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,160
So a neat freak is someone who likes things to be very clean.

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,920
And so a neat freak does not live in a pigsty.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,480
A neat freak does not like to be in pigsties.

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,360
A neat freak likes things to be in order and organized and clean.

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,280
So maybe somebody that's cleaning all the time or that's very, very organized, you can

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,560
say that that person is a neat freak.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,160
He is a neat freak or she is a neat freak.

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,960
Now it's not necessarily a good thing to be a neat freak, but it's not terrible either

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,840
to call somebody a neat freak.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
You can say, hey, are you a neat freak?

86
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Right.

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,440
That means, are you really concerned about cleanliness?

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Uh-huh.

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
OK.

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Very good.

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
So a lot of great vocab.

92
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,160
Take a look again at our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

93
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,080
This bathroom is a pigsty.

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,000
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's wrong?

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,080
I just can't stand it.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,560
It's really gross in here.

98
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,800
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery, so I cleaned it.

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
You did what?

100
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,160
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

102
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
Are you out of your mind?

103
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
I can't help myself.

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
It's just so disgusting in here.

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,920
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

106
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,640
Just leave it to the cleaners, OK?

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Hang on.

108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,280
You're such a neat freak.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm out of here.

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,640
All right.

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
We're back.

113
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,480
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,960
Fluency Builder.

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,760
So the first thing we want to talk about today is this phrase, I can't stand it.

116
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
So this is our neat freak talking.

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,640
She says, I just can't stand it.

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,120
I just can't stand it.

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,600
So if you can't stand something, that means that you can't tolerate it.

120
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
That's right.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
It means I don't like it.

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
I don't want it anymore.

123
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,560
I need to change it.

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
OK.

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,880
So for example, if a bar is too loud, you say, I have to leave.

126
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,040
I can't stand it.

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,520
It's too loud in there.

128
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
That's right.

129
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,160
Or if you are next to me all day and you do tap, tap, tap, tap, tap with your pen, I say,

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Marco, stop it.

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
I can't stand it anymore.

132
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,560
OK, very good.

133
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,320
And then she went on to explain or to justify why she was cleaning the public restroom.

134
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,080
And she said, I can't help myself.

135
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,880
It's just too disgusting in here.

136
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,120
I can't help myself.

137
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,120
So this means that I cannot control my actions.

138
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,880
OK, I cannot control what I do.

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,400
And so in some cases, like with a neat freak, the person really needs everything to be clean.

140
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,600
And so she says, I can't help myself.

141
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
I have to clean.

142
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,200
OK, so it's a phrase like this.

143
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Don't try to separate it and try to define what help and help yourself.

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,040
It's more of a phrase saying, I can't control myself.

145
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
I can't control my actions.

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
I can't help myself.

147
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,680
Or in the case of another person, you say, she can't help herself.

148
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,040
She can't help himself.

149
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,320
Right, so maybe you'd like to smoke.

150
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,520
And you're smoking all the time.

151
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
And you say, stop smoking.

152
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,880
You say, I can't help myself.

153
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
I have to smoke.

154
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
Yeah, I have to smoke.

155
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,000
OK, and for our last phrase, she said, hang on.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

157
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Hang on.

158
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
This means wait.

159
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Wait a moment.

160
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Yeah.

161
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, so this is a really common phrase we hear in English.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,080
It's something that you'll hear all the time in a pretty relaxed environment, not maybe

163
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
in school.

164
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,840
But if someone says, OK, I'm going to go.

165
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
See you later.

166
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,480
And the other person wants to say something to you, say, hang on.

167
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Hang on.

168
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Wait a moment.

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
I have to tell you this thing.

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,540
So you wouldn't really use it with your boss or a customer.

171
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,960
You wouldn't say, hang on a second.

172
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,960
No, you would say that with a friend or family member, things like that.

173
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,840
OK, so it's a very informal way of saying, wait a moment.

174
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Wait a minute.

175
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
That's right.

176
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,260
So the formal way is, please wait.

177
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Please wait.

178
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,240
And the informal way is, hang on.

179
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Hang on.

180
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,880
Or hang on a sec, which is hang on a second.

181
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
All right.

182
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,920
That's all the words we have for today.

183
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,000
Why don't we review our dialogue one last time?

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Ugh, this bathroom is a pig's die.

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,280
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

186
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
What's wrong?

187
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
I just can't stand it.

188
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
It's really gross in here.

189
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,320
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery, so I cleaned it.

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,920
You did what?

191
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,840
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

192
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,320
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

193
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,840
Are you out of your mind?

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I can't help myself.

195
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,680
It's just so disgusting in here.

196
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,640
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

197
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,400
Just leave it to the cleaners, OK?

198
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Hang on.

199
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

200
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
You're such a neat freak.

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,840
I'm out of here.

202
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,000
All right, so talking about cleanliness and being neat, what type of person are you?

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,320
Are you a neat freak?

204
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,920
Do you keep everything very clean and ordered?

205
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm not a neat freak, but I'm also not a pig, not a slob.

206
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
I like things to be very organized.

207
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,400
But I'm not really concerned about cleaning so much.

208
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm too lazy.

209
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,280
So there's a difference for me.

210
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,200
In my house, I know where everything is, but maybe there's clothes on the floor and there's

211
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,640
books in the bathroom.

212
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
So I'm in the middle.

213
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
What about you?

214
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Are you a neat freak?

215
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,240
No, I'm not really a neat freak per se, but I do like everything to be very clean, on

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
the other hand.

217
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,440
So I can't really stand it when things are...

218
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,600
If things are out of order a little bit, that's okay, but if things are dirty, that really

219
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
gets to me.

220
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,960
But I'm not the type of person that has folders with all my bills in one folder or labels,

221
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,880
or even when I was in school, I didn't have my notebooks in order.

222
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Really?

223
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
So we're the opposite.

224
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,280
Yeah, exactly.

225
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,720
But I hate things that are dirty.

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Interesting.

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,160
Well, let us know, are you a neat freak?

228
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,820
