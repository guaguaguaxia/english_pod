1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,780
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,340
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,700
And today we're going out to eat.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,860
Yes, good thing too because I'm hungry.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,580
I know, it's almost lunchtime.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,900
So today we're going to be talking about eating at a restaurant and giving some great recommendations

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,900
and suggestions.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,500
Yes, we have language for describing food, for describing restaurants and for making

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
suggestions.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,460
Great, so let's start with our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,020
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,460
We have two words today from our dialogue which you'll need to know to understand the

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,460
dialogue.

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,460
Great.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,060
The first one that we have today is food poisoning.

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,380
Food poisoning.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,460
Food poisoning.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,780
Food poisoning.

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,140
So food poisoning is...

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
Not a good thing.

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,820
Not a good thing.

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,740
It is when you eat some bad food and that food makes you sick.

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,860
So you get food poisoning.

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,980
Okay, so food poisoning, yeah, not a good thing.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,820
Okay, the next word.

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
Allergic.

29
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Allergic.

30
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,820
Allergic.

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,820
Allergic.

32
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,780
So when you're allergic to something...

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,860
It makes you sick.

34
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,940
That one thing makes you sick.

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,260
For example, I'm allergic to seafood.

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,380
If I eat seafood, I cannot breathe.

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,780
Oh, okay, so you definitely want to stay away from fish.

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,980
Yes, yes.

39
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,540
Some people are allergic to nuts, like peanuts.

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
Or maybe milk.

41
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,540
Milk.

42
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Yeah.

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,540
Cool.

44
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,900
So when one type of food makes you sick, you are allergic to that food.

45
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,380
Okay, great.

46
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,180
So with this in mind, now we can listen to our dialogue for the first time at its normal

47
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,180
speed.

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,460
But don't worry if you don't get everything now because...

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:55,500
We'll come back and teach you the important language.

50
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,620
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

51
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,620
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighborhood.

52
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,620
Do you have any suggestions?

53
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,340
I know this really nice Italian place.

54
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,540
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

55
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,940
I'd recommend giving it a try.

56
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,920
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,940
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,460
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

59
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,100
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

60
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,060
The fish is outstanding.

61
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,220
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,060
Okay, well, let me think.

63
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,940
Oh, I know this great little place.

64
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,780
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

65
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,780
You could give them a try.

66
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:48,260
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

67
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,020
Well I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of those great restaurants.

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,980
Yeah, some really good recommendations except for food poisoning, right?

69
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,780
No, not so good.

70
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,840
Let's start with our language takeaway for this lesson.

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,300
Language takeaway.

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,380
Our first word on language takeaway is check out.

73
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,540
Check out.

74
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,540
Check out.

75
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,740
Check out.

76
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,100
So we have some great examples on how we can use check out in different situations and

77
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,820
then you can understand the meaning.

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Example one.

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,220
Have you been to the new cafe next door?

80
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,940
Yeah, I checked it out yesterday.

81
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,760
The food was great.

82
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,380
Example two.

83
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:40,380
Hey, check out my new car.

84
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,380
Example three.

85
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,940
I'm going to check out that new shopping mall this weekend.

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,340
So I can understand that it just means look at.

87
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,620
Yeah, look at or yeah or go see.

88
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,020
So let's go check out that new bar in town.

89
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,540
Yeah, okay, cool.

90
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,340
Next word is bistro.

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,340
Bistro.

92
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Bistro.

93
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,340
Bistro.

94
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,700
So what's a bistro?

95
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,300
It's kind of complicated, but it's like a small restaurant that's not really cheap though.

96
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,140
Not so cheap, but not so expensive.

97
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,980
And it's usually French.

98
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Yes.

99
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,260
So yeah, small informal restaurant.

100
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,820
Yeah, bistro.

101
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,740
Okay, so our third phrase for today is not all that crazy about.

102
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,780
Not all that crazy about.

103
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,740
I'm not all that crazy about.

104
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,620
Okay, again, kind of a funny phrase, but we've got some examples that will help you understand

105
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,180
the meaning.

106
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Example one.

107
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,580
Do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow?

108
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,780
I'm not all that crazy about shopping.

109
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,580
I don't like spending money.

110
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Example two.

111
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,580
I'm not crazy about jazz music.

112
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,220
Can I change the song?

113
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,100
So this is just a really polite way of saying you don't like something.

114
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Exactly.

115
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,860
But now the opposite of this would be tasty.

116
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Tasty.

117
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,460
That's our fourth word, tasty.

118
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,580
Tasty.

119
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,020
So when something is tasty, it's good.

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
It's good.

121
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Like delicious.

122
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Delicious.

123
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
Yeah.

124
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,020
You know what?

125
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,540
In English, we almost never say the food is delicious, but we always say it's really

126
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,540
tasty.

127
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
Yes.

128
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
This is really tasty.

129
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Yes.

130
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Okay.

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Tasty.

132
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,060
And our last phrase for language takeaway, in the mood for.

133
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,860
In the mood for.

134
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
In the mood for.

135
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,800
Let's listen to some examples of this phrase and we'll understand the meaning a little

136
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,700
bit better.

137
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,680
Example one.

138
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,700
We always eat hamburgers for dinner.

139
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,780
I'm in the mood for something different.

140
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,300
Example two.

141
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,540
Let's watch a movie.

142
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,660
How about Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

143
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,000
I am not in the mood for a horror movie.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,020
So if I'm in the mood for something, I feel like doing or eating or watching.

145
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,940
It means you want to do that now.

146
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Yeah.

147
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm in the mood for.

148
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Okay.

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,660
Some great language we just looked at.

150
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:34,340
And I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

151
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,020
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

152
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,880
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighbourhood.

153
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,540
Do you have any suggestions?

154
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,860
I know this really nice Italian place.

155
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,660
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

156
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,380
I'd recommend giving it a try.

157
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,220
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

158
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

159
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,400
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

160
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,440
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

161
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,480
The fish is outstanding.

162
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,100
It sounds fantastic.

163
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,140
But I'm allergic to seafood, so...

164
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Okay.

165
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
Well, let me think.

166
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,620
Oh, I know this great little place.

167
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,580
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

168
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,300
You've got to give them a try.

169
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:43,060
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

170
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,440
Okay, some really great and useful phrases there.

171
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,340
And I know you want to talk about specifically some of these phrases.

172
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Yes.

173
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,180
So, today's lesson is all about making recommendations, right?

174
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Right.

175
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,820
So, let's look at some useful phrases in Fluency Builder.

176
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,820
Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,700
So, in the dialogue, we heard a great way of asking for a suggestion.

178
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,700
That's right.

179
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Let's listen.

180
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,180
Do you have any suggestions?

181
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,060
Do you have any suggestions?

182
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,020
So, that's how you would ask for a suggestion.

183
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
Or you can say something else like, do you have any ideas?

184
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah, or you might say, do you have any thoughts?

185
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,740
Okay, so that's asking for suggestions.

186
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,180
In response to this, you can say something like this.

187
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,300
I'd recommend giving it a try.

188
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,660
I'd recommend giving it a try.

189
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,300
We also heard another phrase that we use for giving suggestions.

190
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,660
You've got to give them a try.

191
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,820
You've got to give them a try.

192
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,380
So, these two phrases are great.

193
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,620
I'd recommend or you've got to give them a try.

194
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,620
Yeah.

195
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Great ways of suggesting.

196
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Yes.

197
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,340
Now, what's really important here is the pronunciation of these words, right?

198
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Yeah.

199
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,260
You'll notice that we don't say I would recommend.

200
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,380
Right.

201
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,180
We use the contraction I'd.

202
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
I'd.

203
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
I'd.

204
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,180
I'd recommend.

205
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
I'd recommend.

206
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:20,220
Similarly, in the phrase, you have got to, we shorten that to say, you gotta.

207
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
You gotta.

208
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,220
You gotta give them a try.

209
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
You gotta.

210
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,220
You know what, guys?

212
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,380
If you can shorten your phrases like this, if you can push the sounds together, you'll

213
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,200
sound a lot more natural, hey?

214
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,240
And also, you'll be able to understand because in movies or in shows, they will never say,

215
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,860
you have got to give them a try.

216
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Yeah.

217
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Yeah.

218
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,660
So, if you can do it in this form, you'll understand what they mean.

219
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Exactly.

220
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Okay.

221
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Great.

222
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,580
Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue a third time and you'll hear some of these

223
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,700
contractions in the dialogue.

224
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
Do you two have any plans for the evening?

225
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,860
We were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the neighborhood.

226
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Do you have any suggestions?

227
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,580
I know this really nice Italian place.

228
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,740
The food is fantastic and the decor is beautiful.

229
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
I'd recommend giving it a try.

230
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,140
Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food.

231
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.

232
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,500
In that case, I know a great little bistro.

233
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,300
They make a really tasty seafood platter.

234
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,260
The fish is outstanding.

235
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,380
It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...

236
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Okay.

237
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,180
Well, let me think.

238
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,100
Oh, I know this great little place.

239
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,980
It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches.

240
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,780
You could give them a try.

241
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:47,220
Ella, you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning, remember?

242
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,140
Okay, great dialogue.

243
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,980
And Erica, I know that you have some food poisoning stories for us.

244
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,620
Well, I don't know about stories, but I've definitely had food poisoning before.

245
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,100
One of the worst times that I ever had food poisoning was when I was traveling in Morocco.

246
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,500
I had some really amazing orange juice, really fresh, squeezed that day in the morning.

247
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,060
And then I got on a bus.

248
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Okay.

249
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,180
I think you can see where this is going.

250
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah, so I was on the bus and then I started to feel really sick.

251
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,580
And I was just hoping and hoping and hoping that the bus ride would be over soon.

252
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,700
But unfortunately, it wasn't.

253
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,140
Oh, no.

254
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,580
All I can say is that I was sick.

255
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,580
All I can say is that I was pretty sick and really, really unhappy.

256
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,060
Yeah, I bet.

257
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,860
Well, that's very strange that you got sick from orange juice, huh?

258
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,900
Well, yeah, maybe it was with some dirty water or something like that.

259
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
I don't know.

260
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,540
It was just, it was a terrible situation.

261
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,500
Yeah, it's always complicated when you're traveling to other countries.

262
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,660
It could be the water.

263
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,020
It could be the way they prepare things.

264
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Yeah.

265
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
Food poisoning.

266
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,340
Well, guys, I hope that you don't get food poisoning.

267
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,620
And if you have any food poisoning stories, it would be great for you to share them.

268
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,060
Yes, at our website, EnglishPod.com.

269
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,580
And we'll see you there to answer all your questions and comments.

270
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
But now we have to go.

271
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,500
Okay, guys, thanks for listening.

272
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
We'll see you there.

273
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Bye-bye.

274
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Bye-bye.
