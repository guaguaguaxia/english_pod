00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,380
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,420
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,420
What's wrong Catherine?

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,200
I'm just a little down today.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,240
You're having a, you're in the mood, you're not in the mood today?

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
Is that what's going on?

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,000
I am not in the mood to record today.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
Actually no, I am in the mood.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,520
So we're talking about moods, feelings, emotions.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,520
This is today's podcast and we're going to be learning a lot of the names for different

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
kinds of feelings.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,120
That's right, so you're going to learn how to describe what mood you're in.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,480
Maybe you're in a good mood, bad mood, etc.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:46,160
So let's just jump into the dialogue and see what's going on.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Are you okay?

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
You seem a bit anxious.

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Yeah, I'm okay.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,440
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,340
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,800
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,440
Yeah, it's weird.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,460
For example, just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,800
really no reason to feel that way.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,520
Well maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,680
I hope you're right.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,360
Okay, lots of feelings.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,480
So many feelings in fact that we're going to talk about the names of them in today's

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,720
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,360
Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,920
So on Language Takeaway, let's take a look at this adjective.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
You are feeling or you seem a little bit anxious.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Anxious.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,240
He is anxious.

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
I feel anxious.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
That's right.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Now this word means that you're feeling nervous or uneasy about something.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,320
Normally when you feel anxious about something like a test, all you can think about is the

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
test.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
Oh, will I fail?

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
What's going to happen?

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
Did I study enough?

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,320
You're worried.

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,240
So this is an anxious feeling.

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
That's right.

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,080
So if you're anxious, you're worried about something or you're nervous about something.

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,400
It could be about your job, interview, a test, etc.

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,640
All right, so moving on now.

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,740
We're feeling anxious, but then we also feel a different type of excitement.

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
We are ecstatic.

51
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
All right.

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,280
So well, anxious is a bad feeling.

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,640
Ecstatic is a really good feeling.

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Okay.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Okay, so I'm happy.

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
I'm really happy.

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm ecstatic.

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,320
That's a really, really, really happy feeling.

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,080
Okay, so if you're ecstatic, it means you're very, very happy.

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
So it's not a negative thing.

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
No.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,640
So when I get a hundred percent on my test, I'm ecstatic.

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,960
I'm really happy.

64
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Okay.

65
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,160
Now basically the complete opposite of being ecstatic would be to feel or be blue.

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Yeah.

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,440
It might seem a bit strange because blue is a color, as you know, B-L-U-E.

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,960
But when you're feeling blue, it means that you're feeling sad or down or upset.

69
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
You're depressed.

70
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Yeah.

71
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,360
So maybe this is why you also have music, the blues, right?

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
The blues.

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,720
He's got the blues.

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,040
That means he's sad about something, usually a woman.

75
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
Aha, okay.

76
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,940
So ecstatic, very, very happy.

77
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,520
Feeling blue, very, very sad.

78
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,320
And well, another example of feelings, also a negative one is if you feel detached.

79
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Detached.

80
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,360
All right.

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,320
So we know the word attach.

82
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,160
That means to put two things together.

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,840
Well, detached means to take two things apart.

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Okay.

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
So what do you feel apart from?

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Other people.

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,560
Aha, okay.

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,280
So for example, if I'm feeling detached, maybe it means that I don't feel like the people

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,400
around me understand me.

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't want to talk to other people.

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm just not feeling very social.

92
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,340
So for example, can you feel detached in your relationship?

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,920
You can, and that's actually a really bad feeling because you should be happy in a relationship.

94
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,880
But when you're detached, it means that you don't really feel close to your boyfriend

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,080
or girlfriend or husband or wife.

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Okay.

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
And we feel detached and lonely.

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,800
So if you feel lonely, that means that you feel?

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,480
Similar to detached, lonely means that you don't feel like you can talk to anyone.

100
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,600
You feel alone.

101
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
You feel alone.

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
So I'm very lonely right now.

103
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,840
I have no one to talk to, no friends, you know, no one makes me feel good.

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
Okay.

105
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,120
So that means that you feel alone.

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
All right.

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,120
A lot of adjectives there, many different ways to describe the way that you feel.

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,840
So let's take a listen to the dialogue again.

109
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,600
Are you okay?

110
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
You seem a bit anxious.

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Yeah, I'm okay.

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,840
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,760
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

114
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,240
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

115
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,880
Yeah, it's weird.

116
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,880
For example, just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was

117
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,920
really no reason to feel that way.

118
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave, and hopeful.

119
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I hope you're right.

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
All right, we're back.

121
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,200
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

122
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,360
Fluency Builder.

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,480
So on Fluency Builder today, the first phrase is mood swings.

124
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,600
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
That's right.

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,560
So this basically means that your mood is changing constantly, all the time.

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
That's right.

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
So mood is the way that you feel and to swing means to go back and forth.

129
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,440
So I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm lazy.

130
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,640
So these are mood swings and it means that you're not normal, you're not flat, you're

131
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,440
going up and down and feeling many different things.

132
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Okay.

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,160
So to be clear, also your mood is the way that you feel at a certain time or a certain

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
day.

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
That's right.

136
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
So you're in a good mood today.

137
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you get good news?

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's right.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,920
So that means that you look like you are happy or it seems that your personality is positive

140
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
today.

141
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
That's right.

142
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
Or you could say, I'm in a bad mood.

143
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Don't talk to me.

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
So maybe you're angry.

145
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Yeah.

146
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
All right.

147
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Very good.

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,160
Now to basically explain why we're having these mood swings, we say that, well, maybe

149
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,400
it has to do with the pills the doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

150
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
All right.

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
Chaos is a thing.

152
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,240
It's a noun.

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,060
And chaos means that there's no order.

154
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,060
Everything is crazy.

155
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,480
It's out of control.

156
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,800
And so basically what this person is saying is that the pills that he's taking, it can

157
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,440
feel out of control.

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Right.

159
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Exactly.

160
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
So they are causing chaos.

161
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,680
To cause chaos, to cause nothing in control and on your hormones.

162
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,280
So, but what does hormones have to do with your mood?

163
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
All right.

164
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,680
Hormones are chemicals that your body actually produces.

165
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Women have different hormones from men, but they affect the way that we feel.

166
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,520
So oftentimes you could say that I'm in a bad mood because of my hormones.

167
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,160
Pregnant women are very famous for having mood swings, happy, sad, angry, because they

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
have more hormones in their bodies that they're not used to.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And so they cannot control the way that they feel.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,520
So an example is if a man has too much of one hormone, like testosterone is a hormone,

172
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,640
then this person will usually be very aggressive.

173
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Right?

174
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
That's right.

175
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,440
And the female counterpart to testosterone is estrogen.

176
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,680
So if you have too much estrogen, maybe you'll be a little bit too sensitive.

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Or emotional.

178
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Or emotional.

179
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
That's right.

180
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Okay.

181
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
So that's what we talk about chaos and hormones.

182
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,880
Now, when we talked about mood swings, we take it as a noun, right?

183
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,600
You have mood swings.

184
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,560
But then at the end of the dialogue, we say, well, maybe your mood will swing positively.

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
So now we're talking, it's separate.

186
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
It's not a noun.

187
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,600
We're taking swing as a verb.

188
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
To swing.

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,400
That means, think about a pendulum, you know, a clock, it goes left and then swings right.

190
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,760
So we could talk about a mood like this.

191
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,800
So maybe your bad mood will swing the other way.

192
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Maybe it will become a good mood.

193
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,880
And so to swing here is the verb.

194
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,520
You can maybe try and encourage your mood to swing.

195
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Okay.

196
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,800
So to be clear, mood swings are a noun.

197
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,320
But then in this last part, we put the verb to swing to kind of explain where mood swings

198
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
comes from, right?

199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,360
So the noun mood swings.

200
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,640
Now you understand that it's kind of like a pendulum and it's swinging back and forth

201
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,000
and you're changing constantly.

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Exactly.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
All right.

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Are you okay?

206
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You seem a bit anxious.

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, I'm okay.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,240
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.

209
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,160
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.

210
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

211
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,280
Yeah, it's weird.

212
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,240
For example, just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely.

213
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,640
Even though there was really no reason to feel that way.

214
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,320
Well maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful.

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
I hope you're right.

216
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
All right.

217
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:39,000
So talking about moods, now there are certain, well maybe like conditions where your mood

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,280
is negatively affecting your life.

219
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,160
Like for example, a person that suffers from anxiety.

220
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
That's right.

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,480
They have anxiety disorders and this means that they're always worried about something.

222
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Right.

223
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,840
So they're always anxious.

224
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Always anxious.

225
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,920
So people who are anxious often tap their fingers or their pencils or their foot, talk

226
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,000
quickly.

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,320
So anxiety, it's not fun to feel anxious and you can only imagine.

228
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,080
So a lot of times these people who have anxiety problems, they will see their psychiatrist

229
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,640
and they will try and get some medicine, some pills to help regulate their emotions, to

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,920
help them feel in control.

231
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Okay.

232
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,800
So that I think is the most interesting thing for me is because your mood is actually very

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,120
much dependent on what's going on chemically in your body.

234
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,480
So as you said, you could actually balance out maybe if you're feeling too anxious with

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,640
drugs, you can actually make you feel less anxious because of the chemicals.

236
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Exactly.

237
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,360
And it's also important to remember that it's not just drugs that you take.

238
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,400
Sometimes people like to exercise and that helps them feel relaxed and calm because when

239
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,400
you exercise actually, your body produces certain chemicals that help you feel happy.

240
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,120
Or when you eat, sometimes when you haven't eaten, you notice that you're very, very cranky.

241
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,240
Oh God, why are you doing this?

242
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Why are you being like this?

243
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
And you eat and all of a sudden, oh, your body chemistry starts to change and so you

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
feel better.

245
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,920
I heard that some people that suffer from anxiety disorders will be also compulsive

246
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,320
eaters because they're nervous.

247
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,280
So you know this, that some people eat when they're nervous.

248
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,800
This is one of the side effects possibly, right?

249
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
It is.

250
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,040
I've heard this too, that a lot of people who are nervous or who are anxious, they overeat.

251
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,760
That means they eat too much.

252
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,240
Even when they're not hungry.

253
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,400
Even when they're not hungry.

254
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:38,360
And this actually has a very large effect on your body because obviously, like I said,

255
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,680
your body chemistry affects your mood.

256
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,840
So if you eat too much, your body maybe reacts negatively and you're even less happy.

257
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,560
It happens to me sometimes in the movie theater, like a really good scene or I'm nervous or

258
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,120
there's an action sequence and I'm just eating that popcorn up and I'm already really, really

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
thirsty but I just can't stop.

260
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
That's funny.

261
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,200
So if you have any questions or any other ways to describe feelings, maybe you could

262
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,520
post them on our boards at EnglishPod.com.

263
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,400
There are so many different feelings and most of them have words or names.

264
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Look those up in your dictionaries and let us know.

265
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
All right.

266
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
We'll see you guys there.

267
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Bye.

268
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:39,560
Hey, watch this.
