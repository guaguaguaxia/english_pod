00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,240
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,760
Katarina And my name is Katarina.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,280
So what are we talking about today, Marco?

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,320
Marco Well, we're talking about one of my favorite

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
topics, which are computers.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,600
Katarina Yes, you're a little bit of a nerd.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,160
Marco A little bit.

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,600
I love computers and technology and everything that's related to it.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,800
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
Maybe we're buying a new computer.

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,960
Katarina Well, I anticipate learning something from

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,160
this because there are a lot of those fancy big words that I don't know that have to do

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,880
with processors and giga things.

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
So that's going to be coming up in a minute here.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:45,880
But first, let's just jump right in and take a listen to today's dialogue.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,040
So can you fix it?

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm sorry, sir.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,080
This computer is not broken or damaged.

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,360
It's simply just too old.

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,360
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,200
There really isn't much I can do.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
What do you mean?

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,720
I bought this computer just three years ago.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,240
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, I know where this is going.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,360
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,960
It has a four gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,000
terabyte.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,320
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers.

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,160
crashing or freezing all the time.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,920
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,520
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,760
All right, we're back.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,200
I think it's a very typical case you go in to get something fixed and they say, we can't

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
fix it.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
You need a new one.

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,400
And not only a new one, but a bigger and better and faster one.

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
And more expensive, obviously.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Obviously.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Called the upsell.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The upsell, yeah.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,520
All right, so there were some very difficult words, I think, because they're very specific

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
related to technology and computers.

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,800
So why don't we look at those now in Language Takeaway.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,400
All right, so the first word we have today is when something is no longer in use.

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,160
Okay, so this word is obsolete.

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
It's obsolete.

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Obsolete.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
And we're not just talking about like, oh, I haven't touched that pen in like 10 years.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,280
We're talking about a piece of technology that is no longer useful because there's something

57
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,640
else that can do a better job.

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Right.

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,240
And actually, not only with technology, we also have words that are obsolete, right?

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Exactly.

61
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,920
Like, thy or thine.

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
You or yours.

63
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,360
Classical English.

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,880
We don't use thy anymore.

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
No.

66
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,960
Thou art very summery today, Marco.

67
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
We don't use that anymore.

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,320
That's obsolete English, right?

69
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
Or obsolete words.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Exactly.

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,760
So obsolete means it's no longer of use.

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,920
We have better and newer things in its place.

73
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,080
All right.

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,760
And now moving on, when the salesman was describing the characteristics of the computer, he used

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,400
some prefixes that were a little bit strange, right?

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,880
Like for example, giga.

77
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,120
Giga what?

78
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Giga.

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,200
All right, so these are actually prefixes that have to do with numbers.

80
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
And so this is not just a computer thing.

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,880
This is a math thing or a science thing.

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,560
So okay, so we've got three different prefixes.

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,160
A prefix is something we tack on at the beginning of a word.

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,880
So we have hertz or byte, right?

85
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,760
These are little bits of a computer.

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Byte.

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Right.

88
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
So you have like megabytes.

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Megabytes, we've all heard before.

90
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
That's the smallest here.

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
We've got megabytes, but bigger than mega, we've got gigabytes.

92
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Gigabytes.

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,160
Yeah, so now for example, the hard drives are 250 gigabytes.

94
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,040
You might even hear someone say gigs.

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
You've got a 250 gig hard drive.

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,040
But what's bigger than giga?

97
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,680
Now it's the terabyte.

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,880
Oh, tera sounds like boom, boom, boom, boom.

99
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,880
I actually wondered what would happen after gigabyte because it's so much information

100
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
already.

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
And now it's the terabyte.

102
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,400
So it's like 1000 gigabytes.

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
So that's like 200 movies.

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,440
That's probably more than that.

105
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,240
It's amazing the amount of storage you can have and how small it actually is.

106
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,120
So mega, giga, tera, going from littlest to biggest.

107
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,240
All right.

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,040
And well, he described a 4 gigahertz processor.

109
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay, so the processor is our next word.

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,920
And this is actually something that determines how fast your computer is going to run.

111
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,160
So it comes from the word to process, right?

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Right.

113
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
To like calculate or to think.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
To do even.

115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
To do.

116
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,960
So you have different examples like a word processor.

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Right.

118
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
So it's like Microsoft Word.

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,760
It allows you to make word documents.

120
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,560
You can also say to process data.

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
You're trying to calculate it.

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,760
But in this case, a processor is like a little brain that's the center of the computer and

123
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,960
that's where all the information gets processed.

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Yeah.

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,740
So it's the brain of the computer essentially.

126
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,360
And the bigger it is, the faster it can go.

127
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Exactly.

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,160
And well, if you don't have a very good processor, your computer is bound to freeze.

129
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
Okay.

130
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,360
So freezing is another key word, especially when talking about computers.

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
This one drives me nuts.

132
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,960
To freeze, it means to stop moving.

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Right.

134
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Right.

135
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
So, well, it has a couple of different meanings.

136
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,400
You might have heard it about ice before.

137
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,180
But to freeze here, we're talking about stopping moving.

138
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,000
So we have a game called freeze tag, where if I touch you, you have to stop running.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Right.

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,160
But here we're talking about a computer freezing.

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm moving my mouse and I'm typing and all of a sudden, my mouse doesn't move.

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,480
I can't close or open or do anything.

143
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,520
And it's really frustrating.

144
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,760
Especially if you're doing something and you didn't save your work, it's gone.

145
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Right.

146
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,040
So if your computer freezes, then usually you have to restart it or turn it off or not.

147
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,320
So that is about it for those words.

148
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,960
But let's take another listen and slow the dialogue down this time so you can catch some

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,560
of those big words.

150
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
So can you fix it?

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,640
I'm sorry, sir.

152
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,840
This computer is not broken or damaged.

153
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,080
It's simply just too old.

154
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,120
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

155
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
There really isn't much I can do.

156
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
What do you mean?

157
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,520
I bought this computer just three years ago.

158
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,920
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

159
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,640
Okay, I know where this is going.

160
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,520
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

161
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,640
It has a 4 gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte.

163
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,920
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk speakers.

164
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

165
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,560
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play Solitaire without the computer

166
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,800
crashing or freezing all the time.

167
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,560
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

169
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,600
Great, so we are back.

170
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,360
So now let's jump into today's Fluency Builder.

171
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Fluency Builder.

172
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,200
All right, so on Fluency Builder, we're going to take a look at three different phrases.

173
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,640
For example, the salesman was describing technology and said that it's ever changing.

174
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,920
Okay, so this is a sort of poetic line here.

175
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,400
So ever changing means always changing.

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Always.

177
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Always changing.

178
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,080
And so we can say that the ocean is ever changing.

179
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,440
You know, the waves are always changing.

180
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,520
But in this case, he's saying that technology is always changing.

181
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,880
It's always progressing into something new.

182
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,760
And so that is a key selling point for this guy.

183
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Right.

184
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,600
So this is actually a very interesting word.

185
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,240
We can use it like in your example, beyond technology, like the way, like the sea is

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
ever changing.

187
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,000
So why don't we listen to a couple of other examples.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Example one.

189
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,440
There's always something new in this ever changing world.

190
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,720
Example two.

191
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,080
Times are ever changing and we must prepare ourselves better every day.

192
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,280
Example three.

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,800
The flu is an ever changing virus that continues to claim many lives.

194
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,880
All right, we're back.

195
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,320
So now we understand ever changing.

196
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,240
So the man who's trying to buy this computer, or at least get his computer fixed, really

197
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,760
starts to get frustrated with the salesman.

198
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,560
And he says, OK, I know where this is going.

199
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
So he hears the sales pitch.

200
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,680
He hears this guy trying to loosen him up a little bit.

201
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,400
He says, I know where this is going.

202
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
So what does this mean?

203
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Where something is going.

204
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,280
So basically what direction a conversation or a topic or a situation is taking.

205
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,280
OK, so he's saying, I know why you're telling me these things.

206
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,800
I know your motive.

207
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,080
Or I know what's happening.

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,480
I know what you're going to say.

209
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,000
OK, so he's essentially saying, I know you're going to try and sell me a computer.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Right.

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,320
So you can use it in other circumstances, right?

212
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,520
For example, a relationship.

213
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,840
I don't know where this is going.

214
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Right.

215
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
What is going?

216
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Classic breakup line.

217
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,180
I just don't think I know where this is going anymore.

218
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,960
So in reference to the relationship, right?

219
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Yeah.

220
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
We don't know what's happening.

221
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Are we going to kiss?

222
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Are we maybe going to get married?

223
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I don't know anymore.

224
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,240
I can't tell where this movie is going.

225
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,360
It's so like, oh, here and there and boring.

226
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,760
You don't know the plot.

227
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Yeah.

228
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
All right.

229
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,000
So it's a very common phrase and it sounds very natural when you say it, right?

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It does.

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,320
And that's why as an influency builder, it really helps you sound like a more native

232
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,580
English speaker when you use these kind of phrases.

233
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,720
And the next one is also very, very good.

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,600
When he describes the condition of the computer, he says it's top of the line.

235
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Top of the line.

236
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Now, what line we're talking about, I do not know, but this is above average line, right?

237
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
So this is the best of the best.

238
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,760
This is the top model or the top computer.

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
And you can definitely imagine a car salesman using this.

240
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah.

241
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Yes.

242
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
This BMW is top line.

243
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,400
It's the best money can buy.

244
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,600
That's another good one.

245
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,320
So basically top of the line is the best of the best.

246
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,580
The above average, right?

247
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
More than above average.

248
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,180
It's really it's the best you can do.

249
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,760
And so the guy is saying, listen, this is our best computer.

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Really?

251
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
You should buy it.

252
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,240
And obviously, you have the line.

253
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,640
It's a lot of money.

254
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Yeah.

255
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,920
It's usually for something that costs money, right?

256
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
For things you wouldn't really use it for a person, right?

257
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
He's top of the line.

258
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
No, no, no, no, no.

259
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,480
Top of the line, I think generally refers to electronics and cars or like motorcycles.

260
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,240
And so you often hear top of the line stereo, top line TV, top of the line car.

261
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,600
But you wouldn't say this about food or people or art.

262
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,920
Yeah, you wouldn't say this.

263
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
This painting is top of the line.

264
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,560
Not about like very unique things.

265
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,840
You'd say this about kind of manufactured things.

266
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Very good.

267
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,680
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:19,960
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

269
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
So can you fix it?

270
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,980
I'm sorry, sir.

271
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,160
This computer is not broken or damaged.

272
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,440
It's simply just too old.

273
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,480
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

274
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,280
There really isn't much I can do.

275
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
What do you mean?

276
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,960
I bought this computer just three years ago.

277
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

278
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,100
Okay, I know where this is going.

279
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,960
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

280
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,440
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

281
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,080
It has a 4 gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte.

282
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,400
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard, and desk speakers.

283
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,080
I have no idea what you are talking about.

284
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,020
I just want to know if it's good and if I'll be able to play Solitaire without the computer

285
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,240
crashing or freezing all the time.

286
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,000
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,600
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

288
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
All right, we're back.

289
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,280
So computers, Catherine, I know you recently got a nice Macintosh.

290
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,720
Yeah, yeah, I did.

291
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,840
It's one of those big screen ones, right?

292
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Yeah, it is.

293
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
It's a desktop, right?

294
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,840
So it's not a laptop and it's got a very fast processor because Macs started using Intel

295
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,560
processors a couple of years ago and that made them much faster.

296
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,160
Wow, and it has, this processor actually has two cores, right?

297
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,160
So basically it has two different brains almost within one processor.

298
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,560
Which gives it really bad headaches.

299
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,280
She complains to me often.

300
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,800
Are you a big Mac fan or PC fan?

301
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm a Mac fan.

302
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
I've been converted.

303
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,320
My roommate in college, my sophomore year, had a Mac and ever since then I've really

304
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
gotten into them.

305
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
So, yeah, I went Mac and didn't turn back.

306
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,640
I still honestly cannot really use a Mac.

307
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I get confused.

308
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,680
I'm looking for the start button and I'm looking for where my documents are.

309
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,080
It's really hard to change over, right?

310
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,720
But once you do, you don't want to change back because everything is so much easier

311
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
on a Mac.

312
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Really?

313
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
But if you're really into PC gaming, then you should probably stick with it.

314
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,920
Stick with the PCs because the games just don't really compare on Macs.

315
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,040
But I've heard that also Macs don't really suffer from viruses, right?

316
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,840
No, they don't, which is great.

317
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,680
Because I always used to get these viruses that would float on my computer because you

318
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,760
know you open some email and all of a sudden there's nastiness on your desktop.

319
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,360
Well now I don't really have that problem.

320
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,320
And also there's really wonderful photo editing software and video editing software.

321
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,700
So everything is just really easy to find and easy to use.

322
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,880
What about you listeners?

323
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,480
Do you prefer the Mac?

324
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,960
Do you prefer the PC?

325
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,200
Or maybe some of our listeners don't really even like computers.

326
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
So let us know either way, we're very curious to hear what you have to say.

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,120
And of course, writing on our comments section is great practice for your English.

328
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,680
Right, so we'll see you guys there and until next time.

329
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Bye everyone.

330
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Bye now.
