00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine and today EnglishPod is in the kitchen.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right. Today we are going to hit the kitchen and we're going to bake a cake.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Alright, so check out this dialogue first and when we come back we'll be talking about some very key phrases and words for cooking in English.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Almost. Let me just put my apron on.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, so the first thing we're going to do is preheat the oven.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Got it.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now we're going to make the batter.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do I have to use the whisk or can I use the electric mixer?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, so now we need a baking pan, right?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Done. So how long do we bake it for?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow, this is a lot easier than I thought.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alright, we're back. So now let's take a look at some of those key words on Language Takeaway.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Language Takeaway

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, first of all, we have a special thing to keep our clothes clean while we are cooking.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What is this thing called, Marco?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is called an apron.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
An apron.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So it's not actually a shirt, it's a piece of fabric that you maybe tie around your waist or around your neck to protect your clothes from flour and butter and oil.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right. So it's very common to wear an apron while you're cooking or maybe while you're cleaning the house or the kitchen in order to avoid getting dirty, like you say.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we're going to start baking our cake and the first thing that we do is we turn on the oven in order to have it at the desired temperature.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now this is something you might see in a recipe that says the desired temperature is 450 degrees.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So that means the temperature you want to achieve. Maybe when you turn the oven on it's only 100 degrees.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Right.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you have to wait for the desired temperature, which is what is indicated in the recipe.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right. So this is what we want. We want the desired temperature of 375 degrees.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So now we got that done and now we're going to make the batter.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right. The batter is the liquid, it's the cake, before the cake becomes a cake.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So it's usually like a very thick liquid, like a very thick, almost buttery, milky substance.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And after you cook it, it turns hard. So batter is the liquid form.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right. So when you're making a cake, you make batter.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now it's different because if you're making pizza or you're making bread, it's not called batter.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No. If you're making pizza or bread, because those are thicker, they're called dough.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But when it's still like milk or water, it's like a liquid, we call it a batter.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A batter. Very good. So obviously to make the batter, we add sugar, we add butter, we add eggs.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And then what we want to do is we want to mix it. And so the other person asks, well, what do I do?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do I have to use a whisk or an electric mixer?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All right. These are two very important tools that you will find in most kitchens.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A whisk is like a spoon, but it's made of metal and it's empty inside.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we use it for things like eggs or milk and sugar. And it can go very, very quickly.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It makes a kss, kss, kss, kss sound, like a whisk sound.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, it's like a wire all around it.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, it's wire that's woven together. And so it's a very, very handy tool, but you only use one hand to use it.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But an electric mixer is what the name says. It's electric. You plug it in and it does the whisking automatically.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right. All right. So this is what we want to use.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And before we put the batter into the baking pan, what we want to do first is we want to grease and flour the sides of the baking pan.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So then, you know, it won't stick.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right. So to grease something means to use oil or butter to make sure that the meat or the dough does not stick later.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right. So you can even use it for, obviously, in cooking terms, if you put butter or something like this,

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but even grease, like the black grease, maybe you need to put it in your door because maybe it's making that weird sound.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right. So to grease something is to add oil or to add butter in order to keep something from sticking.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right. OK. So a lot of words there. Now, why don't we pass on to some phrases?

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's start with some fluency builder.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, at the beginning of the dialogue, we talked about the oven.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The real phrase you're going to see in a cookbook is preheat the oven.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's right. So we have the prefix there, pre, to preheat something.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And that means to begin or to start heating.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, this is because when I turn my oven on, right, Marco, it's not 450 degrees.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It takes some time to become hot.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So we preheat the oven. We turn it on before we need it in order to make sure it's ready when we do need it.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's right. So you're going to see it in every recipe. If you're baking something, you need to preheat the oven.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And now when we were actually mixing some of the things, we came up on this interesting phrase when we said we need to sift the flour and the baking powder.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
All right. Now, these are both white substances. They're soft.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They're dry. And sometimes they are. They're bumpy. They have lumps in them.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So we need to make sure that there are no lumps.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And we have a special tool that will help us sift the flour and sift the baking powder.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it's like a wire mesh tool. And you rotate the handle. You turn the handle.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And it will flatten out this flour so that there are no more bumps. It's all smooth.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OK. I think I've heard it also when they're talking about gold, right?

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't they say that they were sifting for gold in the rivers?

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right. Well, you have a tray and you shake the tray to make sure the small gold falls down, but the big, the chunks stay on top.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's the same idea. Yeah.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
OK. So that's what we're doing here. We're sifting the flour and the baking powder.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And now we put our cake in the oven and we ask, well, so how long do we bake it for?

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And we say, well, we can leave it in there for about 25 minutes.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So the phrase here, to leave it in, means to keep the cake in the oven.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And this is something we can say about a lot of things.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So maybe the turkey that we're cooking is in the oven. It's been in the oven for four hours.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I look at it and I say, is it ready yet? My mom says, no, leave it in. Leave it in.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So that means don't take it out. Keep it in the oven. Leave it in.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So we don't really need to say leave it inside the oven or we don't need to be too specific.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We can just say leave it in. Keep it cooking. Keep it cooking. That's right.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
OK. So let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
OK. So are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Almost. Let me just put my apron on.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OK. So the first thing we're going to do is preheat the oven.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Got it.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Now we're going to make the batter.

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do I have to use the whisk or can I use the electric mixer?

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
OK. So now we need a baking pan, right?

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Done. So how long do we bake it for?

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes.

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wow. This is a lot easier than I thought.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So baking a cake seems easy enough.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now maybe there are some other things that we can add that we didn't mention.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like, for example, vanilla extract. It's mentioned in the recipe.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So that is a liquid, right?

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a liquid. It's a flavor.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So extracts are used to give different foods flavors.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can have orange extract and vanilla extract.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Vanilla comes from a bean, a brown bean.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They take the oil from this plant and that's what gives things like cake a vanilla flavor.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now what about this baking pan?

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is specifically for cakes.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now what if you're making something like muffins? Is it also called a baking pan?

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, you'd have a muffin tin or a muffin pan.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And so those are a different shape.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
They're round. They're circular.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They're made of that tin material.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They're not very heavy and they can go in the oven and not break.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But normally we have a baking sheet which is flat.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or a baking pan which would be for a cake pan.

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's got sides on it.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And we have a muffin tin which is for muffins.

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And what we didn't mention is we actually have our cake

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but then there's something that we always add on top of the cake or all over the cake.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, well not always but most cakes, at least most tasty cakes, have frosting.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So that's something that you add after the cake has finished cooking.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's right. So frosting is like a cream or something that you add around the cake.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's actually just sugar and water.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Sugar and water. Oh really?

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can add milk if you want to make it thicker.

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But when I make frosting, I like to make it from scratch.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That means I make it by myself.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I use water and powdered sugar.

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Powdered sugar. And then you mix it.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You mix it. You whisk it.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And then you get the frosting.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Very interesting.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And well, maybe this recipe is actually real.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Although we didn't give the amounts, the quantities.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But maybe you can try baking a cake and let us know how it goes.

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Or maybe you can give us a cake recipe.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's right. Our website is EnglishPod.com.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We hope to see you guys there.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
