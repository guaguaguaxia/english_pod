00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,960
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,420
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,440
And today we're going back to the movies.

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
That's right.

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
We've got a great lesson today and I'm really excited about this dialogue.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
I think it's fantastic.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,000
We have an original EnglishPod production of a movie trailer.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,600
So what is a movie trailer?

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,040
Well, whenever you go to the cinema, before the movie starts, you have previews of upcoming

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
movies.

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,000
So it's an advertisement for a future movie.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Exactly.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
So that's a movie trailer and that's what we're bringing you today.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,600
A lot of great language you'll commonly hear in action movies.

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Right.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,960
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
Vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,320
We have one word today, possess.

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Possess.

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Possess.

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Possess.

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
So when you possess something, you have it.

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
It's in your possession.

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Simple.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
You have it, right?

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Yep.

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
So in this dialogue, our actors possess something very important.

30
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,360
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be a little bit fast

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,000
and a little bit difficult to understand.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,800
But don't worry, we'll come back and explain all of the key language later.

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Look!

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:32,520
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:45,040
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,480
I don't care where they are.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't care what it takes.

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,440
You find them and bring them to me.

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,280
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,280
You want to play rough?

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,760
Say hello to my little friend.

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
With a little help from the governor.

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Listen to me.

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
We have to go.

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Listen to me, we have to get them out of there, no matter what.

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,720
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Double the action.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
Get down!

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
Triple the excitement.

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,480
Get down again!

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,160
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm gonna make them run off again.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,520
Two hosts, one podcast.

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,320
EnglishPod.

55
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
Coming to a theater near you.

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,680
Wow, so it sounds like a really good movie.

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
I know, when's it coming out?

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,480
I think in 2015.

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,760
Okay, I'll put that in my calendar.

60
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Okay, let's take a look at the vocabulary we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,400
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,720
In Language Takeaway today, we have three words.

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,240
What's our first one?

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Survival.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Survival.

66
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Survival.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Survival.

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Well, survival is continuing to live even in really hard times.

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,000
It comes from the verb to survive.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Right, so survival is the noun form.

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,040
Right, so maybe you are lost in the jungle and you have to fight for survival.

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Right, you have to try to survive.

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,280
Okay, our next word, defend.

74
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Defend.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Defend.

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Defend.

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,520
So let's listen to some examples of defend so you can understand the meaning.

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Example one.

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,240
We have to defend the castle.

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,760
The army is trying to kill the king.

81
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,480
Example two.

82
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,160
The soldiers defended the base in a difficult battle.

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,920
Example three.

84
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,160
These new machine guns will defend us.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,240
So basically it's to protect, right?

86
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,960
Right, to protect from something that is really harmful.

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,520
Okay, so you would defend your children, you would defend your...

88
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Your house.

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Your house.

90
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Or your castle.

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
Your dog, your cat.

92
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,840
Okay, and our last word on Language Takeaway, rough.

93
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Rough.

94
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Rough.

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
R-O-U-G-H, rough.

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,120
Right, it's got that uff sound.

97
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,840
So it basically means...

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,520
So when something is rough, it's a little bit violent.

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
And hard.

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Hard.

101
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,040
For example, boxing is a rough sport.

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Or hockey is also a rough sport.

103
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Exactly.

104
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,120
So you have rough sports or maybe even a person can be a little bit rough.

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
Yes, or that person can play rough.

106
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,400
Play rough, exactly.

107
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
So rough.

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,720
Okay, so we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

109
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,120
And this time it'll be a little bit slower so you can understand the language a little

110
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
bit more clearly.

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:39,120
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:48,280
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

113
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't care where they are.

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,040
I don't care what it takes.

115
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,120
You find them and bring them to me.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,640
They only had one chance.

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,040
And their chance was to fight back.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, you want to play rough?

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,340
Say hello to my little friend.

120
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,160
With a little help from the governor.

121
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,760
Listen to me, we have to get them out of there, no matter what.

122
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
Double the action.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Get down.

125
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,000
Triple the excitement.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,320
Get down again.

127
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,360
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

128
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,960
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.

129
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
Two hosts, one podcast.

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
EnglishPod, coming to a theater near you.

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,400
So we saw some interesting phrases in this dialogue.

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,680
Let's take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

133
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,920
The first phrase that we saw, at all costs.

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
At all costs.

135
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,080
At all costs.

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
At all costs.

137
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,160
So let's listen to some examples before we explain at all costs.

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Example one.

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll protect my kids at all costs.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Example two.

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,920
We have to get this project done at all costs.

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,920
Example three.

143
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,560
You find those criminals at all costs.

144
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,920
Well, if you're going to protect your kids at all costs,

145
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,560
you're going to protect them even if it's really hard.

146
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,440
Right, it doesn't matter how hard it is or what you have to do.

147
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,000
Exactly.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,320
You'll do it at all costs.

149
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,080
Now let's take a look at our second phrase for Fluency Builder.

150
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
And it's very similar to at all costs.

151
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,440
Yeah, really similar.

152
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,760
No matter what.

153
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,400
No matter what.

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,560
No matter what.

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,480
No matter what.

156
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,680
For example, I'm going to go on vacation no matter what my boss says.

157
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,920
Nothing's going to stop you.

158
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,080
If he says no, I'm still going on vacation.

159
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,480
And I'm going to protect my kids no matter what.

160
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,400
Exactly.

161
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,160
No matter what.

162
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,360
I don't have kids though.

163
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,440
But you will protect them no matter what.

164
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,800
If I had them.

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
OK.

166
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
And our last phrase, stand in their way.

167
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Stand in their way.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
Stand in their way.

169
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,480
Stand in their way.

170
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,760
So let's listen to some examples of stand in someone's way.

171
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,480
And then we'll come back and explain it.

172
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,080
Example one.

173
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,240
Don't let anything stand in the way of your goals.

174
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,960
Example two.

175
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm going to find that guy and nothing is going to stand in my way.

176
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,720
Example three.

177
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,720
I don't care what happens.

178
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm going to get that money and you better not stand in my way.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
So when something stands in your way, it's.

180
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,760
It's preventing you from reaching your goal.

181
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
From reaching your goal, right.

182
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,600
But we can also have somebody standing in your way physically.

183
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,560
Like really you're standing close to me and I can't pass through the door.

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,080
Right.

185
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,280
So maybe the person is at the door and it's standing in my way.

186
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,160
I can't go in.

187
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,640
Yeah.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,120
OK.

189
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,600
But here we're not really talking about a real thing, right.

190
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
That you can touch.

191
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,240
It's more of some obstacle that's preventing you from reaching your goals

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,760
or from doing what you want to do.

194
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,240
Yeah.

195
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
So now we can listen to our dialogue again.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,840
And now you can understand these words that we've just talked about.

197
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,080
Look.

198
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,480
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

199
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,680
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful,

200
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,320
they have to defend it at all costs.

201
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,760
I don't care where they are.

202
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
I don't care what it takes.

203
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,600
You find them and bring them to me.

204
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,600
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
You want to play rough?

206
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Say hello to my little friend.

207
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,600
With a little help from the governor.

208
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Listen to me.

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,080
We have to get them out of there.

210
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
No matter what.

211
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,600
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

212
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Double the action.

213
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,080
Get down.

214
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Triple the excitement.

215
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Get down again.

216
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,080
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

217
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm going to make them an offer again, people.

218
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Two hosts.

219
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
One podcast.

220
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
EnglishPod.

221
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Coming to a theatre near you.

222
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I know that you're a big movie fan, right?

223
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Yeah, I'm a big movie fan.

224
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
I usually watch maybe three or five movies a week.

225
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Really?

226
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Yeah, yeah.

227
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Wow.

228
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
How do you like the movie?

229
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I love the movie.

230
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
You like the movie?

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
I love the movie.

232
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
I love the movie.

233
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
I love the movie.

234
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Really?

235
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Many students of English like to watch movies as a way to improve their English.

236
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,080
That's one of the best ways to learn English is through songs and movies.

237
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,080
What do you think are some useful movies that people can watch to practice English?

238
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Well, I would recommend children's movies.

239
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Really?

240
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Yeah, they have simple vocabulary, but they have very common language.

241
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,080
And also, what's happening in the movie is very easy to understand and to follow.

242
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,080
So you can see the action and then hear the word.

243
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Exactly.

244
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:33,080
So if you like to watch movies, rent a DVD or go buy a DVD, watch it in the original language with English subtitles.

245
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
So you should watch it in English.

246
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
With English subtitles.

247
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Yeah, and what are subtitles?

248
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Subtitles are the words that you see at the bottom of the screen that translate what the people are saying.

249
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Okay.

250
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Yeah, that's the best thing to do.

251
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Try that exercise.

252
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
If you have a pen and paper with you, it's much better.

253
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,080
You can pause the movie, write down a word you don't understand, and then maybe review it later.

254
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
That's a really good tip.

255
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:06,080
I always tell my students that they should watch movies, listen to music, read the newspaper, and write down at least five new words or phrases a week.

256
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Yeah, yeah, it's a really good exercise and you'll improve a lot.

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Yes.

258
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
So everyone, we want you to go out and watch a movie in English.

259
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Turn on the subtitles and write down some new vocabulary.

260
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Exactly.

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:26,080
And if you have any comments or questions or maybe even suggestions, you can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave them in our community page.

263
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Exactly.

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
So we're out of time today.

265
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
We'll see you guys next time.

266
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080

267
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Goodbye.

268
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Goodbye.
