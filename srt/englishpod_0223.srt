00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,480
My name is Catherine and today we have a very descriptive lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
That's right.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,440
We have an elementary lesson for everyone and we are going to talk about facial hair.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,920
Okay, so Marco, you don't have any facial hair.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
I don't.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,520
Well, I like to shave every other day.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,080
But yeah, that's what facial hair is.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,560
It's hair that you have on your face.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,880
Okay, so we're at the police station in this dialogue.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,040
Let's take a listen and find out why.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,560
Okay, Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,240
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw and Paul will draw a picture.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
Are you ready?

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Yes.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, he had brown hair, long hair and he had some facial hair.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
It was brown too.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Good.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,920
Okay, the facial hair, was it a beard or a mustache?

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Both.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
His mustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Ah-ha.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Hmm.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Like this?

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Yes, that's the mustache.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,360
But the beard isn't right.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,760
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,720
I think it was just on his chin.

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,840
A goatee?

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Was it like Paul's?

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
Uh, yes, that's it.

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,760
He had a goatee.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
Okay.

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,920
Now, what about sideburns?

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,760
Did he have sideburns?

37
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,240
Um, yes.

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,800
They were long and thick, like yours.

39
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Alright.

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
There.

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,360
Was this the man you saw?

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,040
Yes, that's him.

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Hmm.

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,000
It looks a lot like you.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hmm.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Why, yes, he does.

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,280
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
What?

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
That's ridiculous.

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
It wasn't me.

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
I didn't do anything.

52
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:59,000
I was over there doing the thing, the best man to do.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright, we're back.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,600
So, as you can see, the woman is describing a bank robber.

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,360
And one of the ways that she's describing him is by the facial hair that he had.

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,680
So there are a lot of very interesting words and phrases here.

57
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,200
Why don't we take a look at some of them in Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,280
Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Okay so in Language Takeaway today we have some really good description words and nouns,

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
things that people have on their face, facial hair.

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
Because there's not just one kind of facial hair, there are many different kinds.

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,760
So our first one is, are we going to skip facial hair?

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
Our first one is mustache.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,080
Okay, a mustache.

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,440
And this is, I think, one of the more popular forms of facial hair.

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
I think it's a style, right?

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
All these styles of facial hair.

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
That's right.

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,000
And so a mustache is basically some hair on top of your lip.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
It's above your lip.

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
And it's usually, it can be thin or thick.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,580
It comes in different sizes, but this is not your whole face.

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,720
It's just above your lip.

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Alright, so for example, a famous person or a famous mustache was Charlie Chaplin, right?

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
That's right.

76
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
Charlie Chaplin had a mustache, just a little bit of hair above his lip.

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,800
But also Theodore Roosevelt had a very big bushy mustache.

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
That's right.

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,920
Interesting fact, you might hear someone say stache instead of mustache.

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,280
This is a short way to say it.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,880
So oh, he's growing a stache.

82
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,520
And also the spelling can be a little bit difficult to understand how you pronounce

83
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,400
it because it's M-U-S-T-A-C-H-E.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,120
So there's no really S-H sound like shh, but you pronounce it mustache.

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,360
Mustache, yeah.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,960
So that's one kind of facial hair, but there are many others.

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
The next one we've got for you is a beard.

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
A beard, okay.

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
This is a really good one.

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,400
A beard.

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,840
I think a beard keeps men warm.

92
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,920
I think a beard keeps a man warm in the winter.

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
Yeah, definitely.

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,740
This is the most hair.

95
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,200
So basically a beard, you have hair on your lip and also all over your face basically.

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,520
So a beard you have all over your face.

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,320
Right, your cheeks, your chin, and above your lip.

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay, very good.

99
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,880
So a famous person with a beard?

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Santa Claus.

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
Santa Claus has a very big beard.

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,040
Yeah, Santa Claus has a big beard.

103
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Big white beard.

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay, so that's a beard.

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
I think that's the easiest to have because you don't need to cut anything or shave anything.

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, you need to trim.

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah, you need to.

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
If you don't trim, it looks kind of bad.

109
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Right.

110
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,240
Well, now moving on to our next style of facial hair, we have a goatee.

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,200
Okay, this might be confusing for some people because it's not a beard and it's not a mustache.

112
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,320
It's basically hair around your mouth, on your chin and your lip.

113
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,600
So I think Sean Connery has a very famous goatee.

114
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
And Brad Pitt right now has a really big goatee.

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Okay.

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,240
Yeah, a big goatee, lots of hair.

117
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
So as you say, it's around your mouth, so your lip and your chin.

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,800
That's right, a goatee.

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
Okay, so that's our third style of facial hair.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,920
And now moving on to our last style, we have sideburns.

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,360
Okay, so think about the word here, sideburns.

122
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Side.

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
They're on your side.

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
They're on the side.

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,200
So near the ears, there is usually some space where a man can grow some hair.

126
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,660
Not with a beard or necessarily a mustache though.

127
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,400
It can be just the hair on the jaw line, near the jaw, near the ears.

128
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,840
So I think this was a very famous style in the 60s and 70s.

129
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,000
You would have long sideburns all along your face.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's right.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Past your ear, right?

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,440
And the longer, maybe the...

134
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
The sexier you were.

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
The sexier, no.

136
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,200
Nowadays, it's not as popular, but you do see people who have sideburns.

137
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,840
I think nowadays, people have sideburns, but they're not as thick.

138
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,760
They're just thin little sideburns.

139
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,160
All right, so all of these are the different sorts and styles of facial hair.

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,400
Of course, there are a lot more.

142
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,160
I think while we were looking for this on the internet, we found a lot of other styles

143
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
that came up like mutton chops and things like this.

144
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,880
But these are probably the most popular ones.

145
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
That's right.

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
And we're going to hear about the most.

147
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,080
Okay, so why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency

148
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Builder.

149
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,920
Okay, Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

150
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,720
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw, and Paul will draw a picture.

151
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
Are you ready?

152
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Yes.

153
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,600
Well, he had brown hair, long hair, and he had some facial hair.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,160
It was brown too.

155
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Good.

156
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
Okay, the facial hair, was it a beard or a mustache?

157
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Both.

158
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,480
His mustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

159
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Uh-huh.

160
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,720
Hmm, like this?

161
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, that's the mustache, but the beard isn't right.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,320
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

163
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,360
I think it was just on his chin.

164
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
A goatee?

165
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Was it like Paul's?

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Uh, yes, that's it.

167
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
He had a goatee.

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,560
Okay, now what about sideburns?

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Did he have sideburns?

170
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,640
Um, yes, they were long and thick, like yours.

171
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,680
Alright, there.

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,000
Was this the man you saw?

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,840
Yes, that's him.

174
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,640
Hmm, it looks a lot like you.

175
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,160
Hmm, why, yes he does.

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

177
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
What?

178
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
That's ridiculous.

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
It wasn't me.

180
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I didn't do anything.

181
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:58,800
I was over there doing the thing, the best man to do, to do.

182
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,000
Alright, so today in Fluency Builder, we are not really talking about phrases as much as

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
we're talking about adjectives.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
So words you can use to describe facial hair.

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,840
Okay, so when the girl was describing facial hair, for example, she said, the mustache

186
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,840
was very short and thin.

187
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,880
Okay, a short and thin mustache.

188
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,000
So you think about it, you can have a very thick mustache, that's the opposite, that

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,360
means very hairy, very wide.

190
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,200
A thin mustache is like a line.

191
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay, so for example, Charlie Chaplin, he had a short mustache, but it wasn't thin,

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it was a little bit thick.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,960
That's right, it was kind of wide.

194
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,080
But you think of, you know, when you see someone who's drawing a mustache on a sign at a restaurant

195
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,360
or in a newspaper, that's usually very thin, because they use a pen, it's very silly looking.

196
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,920
Right, so those are different adjectives to describe, not only a mustache.

197
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,440
So basically we can use these to describe any sort of hair.

198
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,120
For example, the hair on your head, you can say he's got short hair.

199
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,400
That's right, or I could say I have long hair.

200
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Long hair.

201
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,960
Or Marco, I could say you have thick hair.

202
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Thick.

203
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Yeah.

204
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,800
So if you have an abundance of hair, that you would say it's thick.

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
That's right.

206
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,800
You know, it's like if you put your hand in it, it feels like there's a lot that's very

207
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
thick hair.

208
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Okay.

209
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,000
Some people have thin hair, so they don't have a lot of hair.

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,320
Okay, good.

211
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,360
And well, moving on to the parts of the face, we described it before as to where a mustache

212
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,440
is, where a goatee is, but let's take a closer look at that.

213
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,280
For example, a mustache is on your upper lip.

214
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Right, so just above your lip, under your nose, that's where a mustache goes.

215
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,960
So that's the upper lip.

216
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,880
But if we're talking about a goatee, it's not just on your upper lip, it's also where?

217
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
On your chin.

218
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Your chin.

219
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
So that's the very bottom point of your face.

220
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,120
So you have your chin, your upper lip, and also when we talked about, for example, the

221
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,480
sideburns, we talked about the jaw, but also it could be part of the cheek.

222
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Right.

223
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,960
So every person has two cheeks, one on the left and one on the right, and those are a

224
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,840
very big part of your face on the sides of your nose.

225
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,480
Okay, so you have your chin, you have your cheeks, you have your upper lip.

226
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,840
I think that's pretty much the only places where you can grow a mustache.

227
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Also on your neck.

228
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, some people have it on their neck or on the back of, well, no, it's not better.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,200
Some people also have it on their neck, yeah, that's right.

230
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Very good.

231
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,760
So a lot of different words to describe facial hair.

232
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk some

233
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
more.

234
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,520
Okay, Sally, we have an artist here to help us.

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,360
We'll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw and Paul will draw a picture.

236
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,920
Are you ready?

237
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Yes.

238
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,200
Well, he had brown hair, long hair, and he had some facial hair.

239
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
It was brown too.

240
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Good.

241
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,240
Okay, the facial hair, was it a beard or a mustache?

242
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Both.

243
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,120
His mustache was very short and thin, just on the top of his lip.

244
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
Ah-ha, hmm, like this?

245
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,600
Yes, that's the mustache, but the beard isn't right.

246
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
I mean, it didn't cover his whole face.

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
I think it was just on his chin.

248
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
A goatee?

249
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Was it like Paul's?

250
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,320
Uh, yes, that's it.

251
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,920
He had a goatee.

252
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,160
Okay, now what about sideburns?

253
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,720
Did he have sideburns?

254
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,160
Um, yes, they were long and thick, like yours.

255
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,560
Alright, there, was this the man you saw?

256
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
Yes, that's him.

257
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,160
Hmm, he looks a lot like you.

258
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,800
Hmm, why, yes he does.

259
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,520
Paul, where were you on Friday afternoon?

260
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
What?

261
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
That's ridiculous.

262
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
It wasn't me.

263
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
I didn't do anything.

264
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:05,440
I was over there doing the thing with the best man.

265
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Alright, so talking about facial hair, Catherine, do you like men that have facial hair?

266
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Yes.

267
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Yeah, you like mustaches, beards, goatees?

268
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,560
Um, well it really depends.

269
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,080
I really like sideburns, but sometimes people don't do them correctly, so I don't like them.

270
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,440
But I like beards, and yeah, goatee, I like facial hair.

271
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
You like facial hair.

272
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,600
What is it about facial hair on men that you like?

273
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Manly men.

274
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,840
I don't know, there's something, you know, kind of rough about it.

275
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Rough, yeah.

276
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Yeah, I don't like the very manicured, very carefully cut facial hair.

277
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,640
I kind of like it a little bit more on the rough side.

278
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,840
Oh, okay.

279
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:55,560
It's interesting because, it's interesting to see also facial hair, or long facial hair.

280
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,960
Like for example, the guys from ZZ Top.

281
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Yeah.

282
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,640
You know, they have like really long beards.

283
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,360
I wonder how long it takes to grow something like this.

284
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm sure we could find out on the internet, but yeah, no, they have competitions.

285
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,120
There's a world mustache competition, for example, and they have the world's longest

286
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
mustache.

287
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,960
So they measure his mustache, it's three or four meters or something.

288
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
Yeah, it can get really long.

289
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,560
Yeah, so I think your hair keeps growing.

290
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
It just depends on when you decide to cut it.

291
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
I think it's also a very cultural thing, right?

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,840
Some cultures are able to grow a lot of facial hair and like to do it.

293
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Others really don't.

294
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,360
For example, you don't really see many Asians with facial hair, with goatees or mustaches.

295
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,520
I think you see more goatees than you see full beards, actually.

296
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,480
But yeah, definitely East Asia, it's not as common.

297
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Although India, you see a lot a little bit more facial.

298
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,880
A lot of mustaches there.

299
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Yeah.

300
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
So this is an interesting question.

301
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,720
Tell us how popular it is in your country or if you like men with facial hair or if

302
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,200
you're a guy, do you like to have a beard, a mustache or a goatee?

303
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,680
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

304
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Bye guys.

305
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:19,760
Catch you later.
