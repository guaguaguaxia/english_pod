00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,760
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about an uncomfortable subject, not because

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
it's uncomfortable to talk about, but because it's, well, it doesn't really feel good when

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,280
you have to go do it.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,280
That's right.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,680
Today we're going to the doctor, but because we need to get vaccines.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,400
All right.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,760
So vaccines, these are, well, let's listen out during the dialogue and maybe you can

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,200
guess what this word means when we come back, we'll be defining it for you, talking about

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,400
different kinds of vaccines, but just remember that we're talking about going to the doctor

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,680
to get these shots.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,920
So let's take a listen to that dialogue.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Hello Mrs. Parker.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
How have you been?

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,240
Hello, Dr. Peters.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
Just fine.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Thank you.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,960
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Very well.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Let's see.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,880
According to the vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus and hepatitis

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,200
B shots.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,120
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox and measles shots.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,880
What about rubella and mumps?

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,280
Well, I can only give him these for now and after a couple of weeks I can administer the

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
rest.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Okay, great.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,120
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,080
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,080
We'll check our records and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,040
Now please hold Ricky's arm tight.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
This may sting a little.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,920
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,760
So now let's take a look at all of these words that are a little bit difficult, but we'll

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,200
try to define them on Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,040
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,300
So Marco, first off, what is a vaccine?

39
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,000
So a vaccine we can say is a type of medicine.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,480
But it's basically an injection or medicine where you're helping a person defend him or

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,600
herself against a specific type of disease.

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,800
Okay, so vaccination is medicine you receive before you're sick so that in the future you

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,480
won't get sick with that disease.

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
That's right.

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
So that's a vaccine.

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
There are many, many different types of vaccines.

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,040
And of course, when you do get them, you need to keep track of them via a vaccination record.

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,720
So a record is basically a list or a document that shows what has been done.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,640
And this is very important when you go to the doctor to have a record of the things

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,860
that you have received, the vaccines you've received.

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,340
So for example, if I have a baby and I want the baby to have vaccinations, we'd have to

52
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,900
keep a record of all of his vaccinations.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
That's right.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,640
So we are, obviously we get different vaccines at different stages in our life.

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
Let's talk about some of the ones that we're taking a look at today.

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
So for example, we have a tetanus vaccine or a tetanus shot.

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,200
All right, the tetanus shot is very famous because it's maybe the most painful.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,440
It really makes you sore for a little while.

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,600
And most people get the tetanus shot when they're very young.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,240
This prevents you from getting the disease tetanus.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,320
And tetanus is something you can get from animals or from dirty nails, dirty metal,

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,660
anything that pokes out at you.

63
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,920
And so you get the tetanus shot, but then after your tetanus shot, every five or 10

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,320
years, you need to get a booster shot.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,280
So there's the tetanus shot and there's the tetanus booster.

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,120
So when we talk about a booster, when we're talking about vaccines, is basically you are

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
reinforcing it.

68
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,920
You are making it stronger because obviously over time it becomes weak.

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,400
The medicine won't last forever.

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,800
So you need to get a booster to make sure that you are still protected.

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Basically it's an update.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
That's right.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,160
So we have tetanus and tetanus booster, but we have another kind of vaccine.

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,080
The disease here is called hepatitis.

75
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
That's right.

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,320
So we're taking a look at hepatitis B and hepatitis A. So there are different types

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,480
of hepatitis.

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
That's right.

79
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,520
So both kinds of hepatitis you can catch from other people.

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,080
Although hepatitis A, I believe you can catch from saliva or contact.

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,640
Whereas hepatitis B you catch from other people's blood or if you have a relationship with

82
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
someone.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,280
So hepatitis A and B are different.

84
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,920
Hepatitis B affects your liver and so there's different kinds of severity here.

85
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,900
Now hepatitis A and B there are vaccinations for.

86
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,600
You can get those shots and it's very important if you're traveling to places that require

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,120
them so that you don't get sick.

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Okay.

89
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,800
So, well, these different types of hepatitis, they are dangerous, right?

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
And they could be fatal.

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,280
But another one that's very, very common, especially with young kids, we have chicken

92
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
pox.

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Chicken pox.

94
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,160
Now it's kind of a funny name, chicken pox, P-O-X.

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
But it's also like you say, very common.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
So basically the symptoms are what?

97
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,440
You get these red bumps all over your body and they itch.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,480
You want to scratch and scratch and scratch.

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,720
And so I remember when I had this, I was a little kid.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,360
My mom said, don't scratch because if you scratch, it will leave a mark.

101
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Right.

102
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
It leaves a scar.

103
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,440
So yeah, chicken pox, you get these little rashes all over your body.

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,040
They're very itchy, but they will go away with time.

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,560
Now it's usually, I've heard that it's recommended that people get it.

106
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,280
Actually you should get it when you're young because it's more dangerous if you get it

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
as an adult.

108
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
That's right.

109
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
It's very painful as an adult.

110
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,240
So basically chicken pox, they say if you get it once, you can't get it again.

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
You'll never get it again.

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
So if you get it as an adult, it's shingles, it's very painful.

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Okay, very good.

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,800
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here.

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,120
Why don't we now jump to another section.

116
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,340
Let's continue talking about these different types of vaccines.

117
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,240
Let's go to language takeaway part two.

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
All right.

119
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,660
So we have this special category of vaccinations.

120
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
They usually go together.

121
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:08,200
We have mumps, measles, and rubella, or there's a special acronym, MMR, mumps, measles, rubella.

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Okay.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
So you basically get like a little combo.

124
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,280
You usually get all three of them at one go.

125
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
So what are these measles?

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
All right.

127
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Measles.

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
Well, measles is a virus.

129
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,440
He's got the measles.

130
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,120
You often read books from like the 19th century where everyone gets the measles when they're

131
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,540
a child.

132
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,120
But measles is basically a virus, but it's kind of like the chicken pox because you get

133
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,680
a rash on your skin.

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,200
And is it fatal?

135
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
Can you die from the measles?

136
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,560
I think in the old days you could, but these days it's pretty, pretty easy to take care

137
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,880
of.

138
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,400
And what about mumps?

139
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Now mumps, I'm not too sure about this, but I've heard that mumps is like a swelling in

140
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,560
the space between your jaw and your ear.

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,580
So you know where your ear kind of comes down to your jaw.

142
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,800
That part of your head starts to swell and is very uncomfortable.

143
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Right.

144
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,280
And it could cause, like the consequences could be fatal, right?

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
That's right.

146
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,520
So what about rubella?

147
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,600
Rubella is another kind of rash.

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,480
And from my reading, I saw that rubella is not very dangerous for most people, but it

149
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,760
is very dangerous for pregnant women.

150
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,000
So most pregnant women are tested for rubella or the rubella vaccine, and they're told to

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800
get the vaccine before they're pregnant so that they don't get this disease and harm

152
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,280
their baby because they can have a miscarriage if they get rubella while they're pregnant.

153
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Right, right.

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,920
Okay, so pretty much you want to get all these vaccines to make sure that you don't get sick

155
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
in the future.

156
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,040
Now, when we were talking about getting the vaccines, the doctor said, he didn't say you're

157
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,320
going to get the vaccines or I'm going to give you a vaccine.

158
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,280
He said, I'll have the nurse administer the vaccine or administer the booster.

159
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
That's right.

160
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,940
So the verb here that we use with vaccine is to administer.

161
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,200
And this is something that the nurse does or the doctor does.

162
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,160
And it's just a way to say that the nurse will give you this shot, to give you a shot.

163
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,760
But administer is more formal.

164
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,040
It's more common in the medical kind of medical talk.

165
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,800
So you'd say administer the test or administer the vaccine.

166
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,340
So for example, a doctor would say, I'm going to administer a shot of penicillin.

167
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
That's right.

168
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,160
Or I'm going to administer this blood test.

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,400
That means I'm actually going to do it right now.

170
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,760
Now, obviously these vaccines, some of them you can take as a little pill.

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Some of them you can take as drops, like, you know, it's very painless, but some of

172
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,400
them you have to get a shot and sometimes they do hurt.

173
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,480
And we saw in the dialogue that the doctor said, this may sting a little.

174
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
Doctors always say this before they give you a shot.

175
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,760
This may sting a little.

176
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,400
Now sting is a verb that means to hurt, but it's not like I hit you in the face, boom,

177
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
it stings.

178
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,200
No, a sting is like a kind of a very kind of light hurt.

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
It's like a pinch.

180
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,000
It's like a small, sharp pain, small, sharp pain.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's a good way to describe it.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,680
So oftentimes we talk about bees, you know, bees that fly around, they sting you.

183
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Right.

184
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Right.

185
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
So it's a small, sharp pain.

186
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Right.

187
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Okay.

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Very good.

189
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
So let's listen to the dialogue again.

190
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,080
Let's keep a lookout for how we pronounce all of these words and we'll be back in a

191
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
bit.

192
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,480
Hello, Mrs. Parker.

193
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
How have you been?

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,920
Hello, Dr. Peters.

195
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,280
Just fine, thank you.

196
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,640
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

197
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Very well.

198
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Let's see.

199
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,520
According to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus and hepatitis

200
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
B shots.

201
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,760
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox and measles shots.

202
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,520
What about rubella and mumps?

203
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,840
Well, I can only give him these for now and after a couple of weeks I can administer the

204
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
rest.

205
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay, great.

206
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,760
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

207
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,680
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

208
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,680
We'll check our records and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

209
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Now please hold Ricky's arm tight.

210
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,680
This may sting a little.

211
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,640
So nowadays, most of these shots are administered when the babies are just born.

212
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,800
They're still in the hospital and they get a lot of vaccines to prevent them from getting

213
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,960
these things.

214
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
That's right.

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,360
I remember when I was a kid, we didn't even have a vaccine for chicken pox.

216
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,440
So these days there are more and more.

217
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,600
The oldest I think is the polio vaccine, the one that we hear the most about because it

218
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,080
was a very serious disease that affected a lot of people up until the 1940s and 50s,

219
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I believe.

220
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,320
So yeah, it's important really to read about these things and to educate yourself so that

221
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,280
you know what you should get yourself and your kids.

222
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,600
That's exactly right because it's very important.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,400
Most of these diseases or most of these viruses have been eradicated because more and more

224
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,040
people have had access to vaccines.

225
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,400
Like for example, polio, it's very rare you would say to actually get it nowadays because

226
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,880
there's a vaccine, but it's very, very important I think.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,840
But some people get a little bit too nervous.

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,000
Like for example, whenever they travel to a tropical country, they're always afraid

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,040
of yellow fever, so they get yellow fever shots.

230
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,040
But I've never really seen anyone get yellow fever because you go to like Thailand for

231
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
a week.

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
A friend of mine went to Thailand and got dengue fever.

233
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,960
So there's no vaccination for this, but it is a very painful disease you can get in tropical

234
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
places.

235
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,280
So I think the moral is talk to your doctor, see what he or she suggests because they will

236
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,360
understand maybe better than you will.

237
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,040
And then just follow their advice for different places that you're traveling to.

238
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
That's right.

239
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,720
