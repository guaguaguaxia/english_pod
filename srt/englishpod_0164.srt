00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,840
My name is Catherine and today we have a very special lesson for everyone.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,120
It's a new level for us.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
Right.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,200
It's an advanced media lesson and we are going to be listening to an apology.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,960
Well, it's an apology letter but we're going to actually have someone talk it out.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Right.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
So, what's happening here is someone is reading a letter they've written and they're trying

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,860
to apologize for something and we don't really know what this something is but I want everyone

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,580
to really listen here to the words that are being used and to the ways in which we can

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:47,240
say sorry because as they say, there are a thousand ways to say I'm sorry.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,680
Dear Mary, I come here today this way because I need to apologize to you.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,240
I failed you.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,600
Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
to me.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,680
I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,440
You mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,200
If in your heart you find you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,760
You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,320
We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
feel something other than hurt.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,680
You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence when there was doubt, a shoulder where tears

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,440
could fall and completeness where there was emptiness.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,600
I wanted to hold on to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,680
What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
of that I had placed in you.

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,680
I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk.

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,220
I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle.

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,920
I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,000
I wanted to love you in only the way you deserve to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,640
myself and you.

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,360
Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,360
The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,000
All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,320
Everything else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy.

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,800
You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,660
You helped me look forward to another day.

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,760
Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry for hurting you and if I had to do it all over again, I would have been 100%

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,520
with you.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Forgive me please.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,600
All right, we're back.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
So the guy seemed to be pretty sad.

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,800
Yeah, this is a very intense.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
Well, it's not a dialogue.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,640
It's a monologue.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
One person is reading it.

49
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,880
So it's a very intense monologue.

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Very romantic.

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, romantic, but also an air of melancholy.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,760
Yeah, that's true.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,080
He's kind of like apologizing and at the same time expressing love and all these feelings.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
So it was very interesting.

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,760
But why don't we take a look at a couple of phrases.

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,800
Now in advanced media, we're not going to analyze the entire dialogue or as we do in

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,320
the other levels, actually pick out items for language takeaway or fluency builder.

58
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,840
So in advanced media, we're only going to pick out a couple of words and phrases and

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
just talk about it and talk about the topic in general.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Exactly.

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,000
So one of the first phrases that we decided to talk about here is this phrase, I failed

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,840
you because this is really the theme of the letter.

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Right.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,000
So if you fail someone, it means that you let that person down.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Okay, so you fail someone, I failed you, or you can say, he failed me.

66
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,920
So when I really needed that person the most, that person didn't come through or let me

67
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,600
down or failed me.

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,360
All right, so let's give an example maybe.

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
I needed my brother to pick me up because I don't have a car.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
And my brother was supposed to pick me up at four o'clock and he forgot.

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
He didn't come.

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,840
He really failed me.

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,160
All right, he failed you.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Yeah, I was disappointed.

75
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,240
Well, this isn't that's not as serious as what happened here in this letter, I think.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Right?

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I think so.

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
But we could talk about what did happen.

79
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I think I have a theory.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
And I know you have a theory.

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,600
So we can talk about that in a minute.

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,880
But before that, we have some other phrases about forgiveness and disappointment.

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Right.

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,840
So he also said, you mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness.

85
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, so we've got a positive and a negative.

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,720
So the positive here is you mean the world to me.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,320
You mean the world to me.

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,400
This means you are so important to me.

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,280
You're one of the most important people in my life.

90
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,800
You're worth the entire world, in my opinion.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
Yeah, it's a very poetic way of saying you're very important.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
And then he says, and now I come asking for your forgiveness.

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Okay.

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,240
So this implies that he did something wrong.

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
I come asking for forgiveness.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,240
So in English, we ask for forgiveness.

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
You can also beg for forgiveness.

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,760
So please, please forgive me.

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,920
But you can't demand forgiveness.

100
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
I demand you forgive.

101
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,880
No, that doesn't quite work.

102
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
All right.

103
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
What else do we have?

104
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
We've got the world again here.

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,560
He says he, the guy who's reading, he says, you know, I wanted to be the comfort for your

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
soul.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
So this is very, again, poetic, when the world was too much to handle.

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,040
Too much to handle is a really important English phrase.

109
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,640
And I'm sure you've heard it before, but we could talk about a little bit here.

110
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Right.

111
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,080
So he says when everything else was too much to handle.

112
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
So everything was so difficult or it was overwhelming.

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Right.

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,440
So you could say even in the office, man, all this work I have to do, it's too much

115
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
to handle.

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Right, right.

117
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Okay.

118
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Too much to handle.

119
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,240
You could also say a child is too much to handle.

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
I think they said this about my brother.

121
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
He was very difficult growing up.

122
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Too hard.

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
He's too, he's too difficult to handle.

124
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
All right.

125
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,600
Well, what about in the part where he says you place comfort where there was fear, confidence

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,300
where there was doubt.

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,640
So this structure is interesting because you placed something where there used to be something

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
else.

129
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,440
So you're replacing something, you're changing something for something else.

130
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
It's an exchange.

131
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,360
So you could say you placed comfort where there was fear, you placed happiness, where

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
there was sadness.

133
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Where there was sadness.

134
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,400
So it's always like kind of opposites, right?

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Exactly.

136
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Okay.

137
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Light where there was dark.

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Right, exactly.

139
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
So that's an interesting format of saying something.

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,440
You did something where there used to be something else.

141
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,600
All right.

142
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,080
And what about this word to jeopardize?

143
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
All right.

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
This is a good one.

145
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,400
I always think of the TV game show Jeopardy, but that's a noun.

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,080
This here is a verb to jeopardize and that means to put something in danger or to risk

147
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
losing something.

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay.

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,240
So to jeopardize your health if you're doing something dangerous.

150
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,200
So smoking jeopardizes one's health.

151
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,080
You're putting your health at risk.

152
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,160
Or I don't want to jeopardize my savings by investing everything I have in stocks.

153
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,600
That means I would prefer to do something safer.

154
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
So you don't like to jeopardize your well-being.

155
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,080
I like to play it safe, as we say.

156
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
All right.

157
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Very good.

158
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,800
And last but not least, this almost the last phrase when he says, even though distance

159
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
separated us, just being was enough.

160
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
What does he mean when he says just being was enough?

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,440
This is very romantic, intensely romantic.

163
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,840
He says, even though we were far apart, just being, so just existing, just breathing was

164
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
enough.

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,920
So just knowing that she's in the world was enough for him to feel happy.

166
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,400
So that's what he means with just being was enough.

167
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Right.

168
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
So just being is existing.

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
It's being alive.

170
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Okay.

171
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Very good.

172
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:08,080
I think we should listen to this apology letter one more time and we'll be back.

173
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,440
Dear Mary, I come here today this way because I need to apologize to you.

174
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,000
I failed you.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,360
Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
to me.

177
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,520
I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me.

178
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,920
You mean the world to me.

179
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,240
And now I come to you asking for forgiveness.

180
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,000
If in your heart you find you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,560
You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most.

182
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,140
We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually

183
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,700
feel something other than hurt.

184
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,480
You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence when there was doubt, a shoulder where tears

185
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,240
could fall and completeness where there was emptiness.

186
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,400
I wanted to hold on to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice.

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,480
What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all

188
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
of that I had placed in you.

189
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,360
I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk.

190
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,040
I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle.

191
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,760
I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible.

192
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,840
I wanted to love you in only the way you deserve to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying

193
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,480
myself and you.

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life.

195
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,200
The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,840
All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true.

197
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,160
Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy.

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,640
You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful.

199
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,500
You helped me look forward to another day.

200
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,600
Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.

201
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,880
I'm sorry for hurting you and if I had to do it all over again, I would have been 100%

202
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,360
with you.

203
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:12,800
Forgive me please.

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,120
Alright so what do you think he did that he's apologizing in this way?

205
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
Because I don't think there were a couple right?

206
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,280
Because he mentions friendship a couple of times.

207
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Yes with a but.

208
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,480
You don't write a letter like this to someone who you want to stay friends with.

209
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,200
You write a letter to this to someone who you have some kind of romantic or intense

210
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,080
feeling for right?

211
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,320
So to me this seems like a letter that was written to someone who was a great friend

212
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,720
and he's afraid of losing that because he cares even more for her.

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Right.

214
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,680
But yeah I guess but do you think he's confessing his love in a certain way here?

215
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,320
I think in some ways he's confessing a love.

216
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,680
You can love your friends that's okay.

217
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,920
But more than that he's just he's apologizing for something that he thinks has completely

218
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,640
destroyed their friendship.

219
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,800
And that is where I'm very confused because I have no idea what he did.

220
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,200
Well maybe he did something that let her down.

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,440
Maybe he became jealous of her new boyfriend or something like that.

222
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,120
Yeah or maybe it's something catty like he was supposed to do something with her and

223
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,120
ended up doing something with other people and left her out or embarrassed her in front

224
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
of people.

225
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
It's hard to say.

226
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,040
Now have you ever written an apology letter?

227
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Yeah I have.

228
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I've written a few apology letters.

229
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,880
I have a very strong sense of guilt.

230
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
I was raised Catholic.

231
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,200
So an apology letter.

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,840
Is it do you usually plan out what you want to say or you just like you just splurge your

233
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,560
feelings onto the paper?

234
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Well you know me.

235
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,440
My personality is very planned and organized and so normally I have points.

236
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,240
So I say if this is the problem there's three parts.

237
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,600
I have an answer for each part and the very end I have the heartfelt apology.

238
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Wow.

239
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
It's like an essay.

240
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,560
I guess it's a little bit more organized.

241
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,160
If I were to write something like this I would just like start writing and whatever comes

242
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
out.

243
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,400
That would probably make less sense than your letter.

244
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,080
Well I just try to stay on focus, stay on point and address the matter at hand because

245
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,680
otherwise then you get into other stuff and you can make people more angry.

246
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Right.

247
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,360
But it is really important to write an apology letter.

248
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Now some of the words and phrases and the vocabulary used here can be used in circumstances

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,960
that are not only romantic.

250
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,880
You can use it in a professional way as well.

251
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
That's true.

252
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,600
In a professional sense you want to be careful not to get too personal.

253
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,800
So in a professional sense it's good to say that you're sorry for any mix ups or for misunderstandings

254
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,920
but in the future you will try to make things better or improve.

255
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,480
But in friendships and in families and in romantic relationships apology letters are

256
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,640
very very important because I'm a big believer in mending bridges.

257
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,120
I know a lot of people who we say in English to burn a bridge that means to destroy a relationship

258
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,400
and never go back.

259
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,640
But I like to mend bridges to make sure that people who I was friends with don't, you know

260
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,520
if we have a fight don't just hate me forever.

261
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,760
That even if there's a disagreement that they understand my perspective or that I understand

262
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
theirs.

263
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
That's true.

264
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I think that's important.

265
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
What about apology emails?

266
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Do you agree with those?

267
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,120
I think that they are a necessity of the 21st century.

268
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,360
I mean I live far away from most of my friends and family and so it's important for me to

269
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,560
be able to communicate in any way.

270
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,400
But and sometimes I mean I'm very shy with some people so sometimes it's hard for me

271
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,640
to talk on the phone because I get stuck and then I don't I can't think of what I wanted

272
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
to say.

273
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,600
And so if a letter helps in that way to get you past your fear or your anxiety then by

274
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,640
all means an email is just as much.

275
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,160
I actually received a letter, a handwritten letter through an email.

276
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
How did that happen?

277
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,600
So the person, they scanned it, they scanned the letter.

278
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Oh wow.

279
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,920
So it was still like it still had a very intimate and personal sense.

280
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,640
But obviously since the mail takes so long and everything they just scanned it and then

281
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
they sent it to my email.

282
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
That's nice.

283
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
So I think that's a good idea.

284
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Maybe you could try that one.

285
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I'll try that one.

286
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,200
I don't agree with the one line email.

287
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,440
I'm sorry, forgive me.

288
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,800
Yeah, yeah, that's not good.

289
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,960
As my parents always used to say when I was growing up and I'd get in fights with my little

290
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,080
brother, the only apologies that we accept are the ones that are from the heart.

291
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,320
So I used to have to apologize again and again and again until I actually meant it.

292
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,800
And so I think that this is a very true kind of idea that, well maybe not in business and

293
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,120
work where you have to be cordial, but with friends and real relationships with people

294
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,560
who you care about, obviously real apologies are very important.

295
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Of course.

296
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,640
So this is an interesting topic and we recommend that if you have any other questions or doubts

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,440
or maybe you want some other explanation for this letter, you can come to EnglishPod.com,

298
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,940
leave it in the comment section and we'll be there.

299
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
So until next time.

300
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,440
Bye.
