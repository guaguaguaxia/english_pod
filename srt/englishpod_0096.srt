00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,840
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we are going back in time again and this time we're going to be in the 1960s.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,760
We're going to learn some phrases and some slang that were really popular back in 1964.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,480
Exactly.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,920
And most of these phrases and words we still use today.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,520
So it's very interesting and very good to know.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
That's right.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm looking forward to this trip back in time.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,280
So why don't we get started with the dialogue.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:46,520
Hey man, I really like your pad.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,640
Those lava lamps are far out.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,520
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,200
It's no problem, brother.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,600
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,640
You dig what I'm saying?

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I dig it, man.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,440
We should throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah, man.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
That would be groovy.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,320
Hey, I got to split for a while.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,080
Are you okay here by yourself?

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,320
Don't worry about me, brother.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,480
You go take care of your business.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
All right.

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Peace out.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
All right.

30
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,500
So great dialogue.

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,800
Very popular in the 60s.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,040
The music, the mood and the words, right?

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
That's right.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,760
So why don't we get down to business and look at the vocabulary that we saw in this dialogue

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,080
in Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,680
Well, the dialogue opened and we heard this guy say, hey man, I really like your pad.

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,640
I really like your pad.

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Pad.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Okay.

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,960
So pad, a very informal way of saying your apartment, your apartment, right?

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,920
And now you can still use it today.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Yeah, that's right.

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,080
We often hear the expression bachelor pad.

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Okay.

46
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
A bachelor pad.

47
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,280
So that's an apartment where a single man lives.

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay.

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
So a bachelor pad.

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Usually it's very nicely decorated and really a nice apartment, right?

51
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Or maybe it has empty pizza boxes all over the floor, Marco.

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,400
Also a bachelor pad.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,960
But so that's what pad means, an apartment.

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Yeah.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,240
They were talking about the apartment and he said the lava lamps are far out.

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Far out.

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Okay.

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
It's far out.

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,920
So that's really cool or amazing.

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Right.

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,960
And now lava lamps, those are those strange cone looking lamps, right?

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,560
Kind of a light with like some liquid moving inside.

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Moving inside.

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Very popular in the 60s.

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Yeah.

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
We'll post some pictures of that.

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Yeah.

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
And the lamps are far out.

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
So now you can use that with other things, right?

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,480
Like you are really far out.

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Yeah.

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,720
Or this music is really far out.

73
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Okay.

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,520
It kind of gives you the feeling like it's sort of spacey.

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Yeah.

76
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,880
All right.

77
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,520
So the pad is really far out.

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
The lava lamps are great.

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,320
And he was saying, thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

80
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,580
To crash.

81
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,080
So to crash at someone's place.

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Right.

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,880
So we're not talking about like a car crash here.

84
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
No, no, no.

85
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,280
But so when you crash somewhere, what do you do?

86
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
Well, you are staying there.

87
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,400
Then you're going to stay there.

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
So you're going to...

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
As a guest.

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Yeah.

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
So like sleep, right?

92
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Uh-huh.

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Yep.

94
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,840
So if for example, you're going to New York and you're going to visit a friend, you might

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,240
crash at your friend's house.

96
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
That's right.

97
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
So interesting word.

98
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,480
And it is quite commonly used now.

99
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,760
So why don't we hear some examples of how we can use it?

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Example one.

101
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,280
Hey man, can I crash at your place tonight?

102
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Example two.

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,240
I lost my key.

104
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,480
So I'm crashing at my girlfriend's house.

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,520
Example three.

106
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,040
No you've been sleeping on my couch for a month.

107
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,640
You're not going to crash here tonight.

108
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
All right.

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Perfect.

110
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
So to crash, right?

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
It's still commonly used today.

112
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Yeah.

113
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,280
Now for the fourth word, groovy.

114
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
Groovy.

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,720
That would be groovy.

116
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,800
So again, this means like great or cool or really nice.

117
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah.

118
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,160
This is, I think this is one of the main words of the 1960s.

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Everything was groovy.

120
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Yes, I agree.

121
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,440
So it kind of gives you the sense that it's sort of really cool, but in a relaxed way.

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
Yeah, it's groovy.

123
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,920
This music is really groovy.

124
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
That's right.

125
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,880
And finally, his friend, he said, hey, I got to split for a while.

126
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
To split.

127
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Okay.

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,840
So if I say I have to split.

129
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
You have to leave.

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
I have to leave.

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Yeah.

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Very colloquial.

133
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,000
And it means I have to leave for a little bit.

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Split for a while.

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We've heard this one before.

138
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,960
So why don't we hear some examples to help you understand how it's used.

139
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Example one.

140
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Hurry up.

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:06,160
We've got to split before the police get here.

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,480
Example two.

143
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,880
This party is boring.

144
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,160
Let's split.

145
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,720
Example three.

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
I have to wake up early tomorrow, so we're going to split.

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Okay.

148
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Very good.

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
So split.

150
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,960
Now also, I think you can use it for relationships, right?

151
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Me and him, me and her split up.

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
That's right.

153
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
So you ended your relationship.

154
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Yeah.

155
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Split.

156
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
Okay.

157
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,240
So we saw five really common phrases from the 1960s.

158
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,480
Let's listen to the dialogue again a little bit slower, and then we'll come back and look

159
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,320
at some phrases from the 60s.

160
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Hey man, I really like your pad.

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
Those lava lamps are far out.

162
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

163
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,440
It's no problem, brother.

164
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,640
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music, and just hang loose.

165
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,040
You dig what I'm saying?

166
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,600
I dig it, man.

167
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,680
We could throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,760
Yeah, man.

169
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,520
That would be groovy.

170
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,960
Hey, I got to split for a while.

171
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,040
Are you okay here by yourself?

172
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,600
Don't worry about me, brother.

173
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,520
You go take care of your business.

174
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
All right.

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Peace out.

176
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
All right.

177
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:37,040
Well, I want to get started at looking at these 1960s slang phrases.

178
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,760
So let's go now with putting it together.

179
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Putting it together.

180
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
All right.

181
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm putting it together today.

182
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Let's start with the first part.

183
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
He talked about, you dig what I'm saying?

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,520
I dig it, man.

185
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,040
You dig what I'm saying?

186
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
To dig it.

187
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
All right.

188
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,920
So we know the verb dig, which means to make a hole, right?

189
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Yeah.

190
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,880
But now he's talking about understand.

191
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah.

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
Basically, you dig what I'm saying.

193
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Do you understand what I'm saying?

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
And when he says, I dig it, he says, I understand.

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Yeah.

196
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Okay.

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
And there's also another meaning to this, right?

198
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Apart from understand.

199
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Yeah.

200
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
It can also mean I like it.

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Okay.

202
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,320
So I really dig this type of music.

203
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,280
Or I really dig this restaurant.

204
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Okay.

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,880
So it's kind of, I like it.

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
All right.

207
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,440
Now moving on, he said we could throw a bash here.

208
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
All right.

209
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
Throw a bash.

210
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,080
To throw a bash.

211
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
So first of all, what is a bash?

212
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
A bash is a party.

213
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,200
A really great party.

214
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,560
An amazing party.

215
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,720
Now I want to look at this verb to throw something.

216
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,680
So we know that you throw a ball, right?

217
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Right.

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,960
But how can you throw a party?

219
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,280
Well, it's basically saying you organize or you host a party.

220
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Okay.

221
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
And how can you use this phrase?

222
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Okay.

223
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,760
So I can say, last week I threw a birthday party in my house.

224
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay.

225
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,520
Or let's throw a bash to celebrate your engagement.

226
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Okay.

227
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,960
Or next week I'm going to throw a dinner party at my house.

228
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Okay.

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
So to throw a party.

230
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,120
And it's usually used for parties, right?

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Right.

232
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
You wouldn't throw a...

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Throw a meeting.

234
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
All right.

235
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
No.

236
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Okay.

237
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,360
So now we heard them use the word man a lot, right?

238
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Hey man.

239
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Yeah.

240
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
That's right.

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,920
Now this is so common, even in modern English, that I think we need some examples.

242
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,160
Example one.

243
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,040
Hey man, watch where you're going.

244
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Example two.

245
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah, man, that's a great idea.

246
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,360
Example three.

247
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,760
Man, that was awesome.

248
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,200
So man is one of those words that you just use at the end of your sentences.

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Or the beginning.

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Or the beginning.

251
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Anywhere.

252
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,160
And so you say, hey man, or yeah man.

253
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Yeah.

254
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,440
What about, do you have to be a man to use it?

255
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,760
Or do you have to be talking to a man to use it?

256
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
No, not really.

257
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Men and women use the word man.

258
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,800
And you can call a girl like, hey man, how are you?

259
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah.

260
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,960
But that sort of means that she's a really, really good friend.

261
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Like the same level of friend as your guy friends.

262
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Yeah.

263
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Yeah.

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Exactly.

265
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Okay.

266
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Very good.

267
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,040
And now for the last phrase, I'm putting it together.

268
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,760
He said, you go take care of business.

269
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,080
You take care of business.

270
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Okay.

271
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,480
So I have to take care of business.

272
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,920
So we're not really talking about business and work here, are we?

273
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
No, no, no.

274
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,440
So basically what we're saying is, go handle your affairs.

275
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,400
So do the things you have to do.

276
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

277
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
So, or solve your problems.

278
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,360
So if I say, I have to go to City Hall today and take care of some business.

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
So you're maybe going to do something like...

280
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,880
Pay my taxes or something like that.

281
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Yeah.

282
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Okay.

283
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,680
So we heard some great phrases.

284
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,080
We saw these words.

285
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk about

286
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
this great decade.

287
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,680
Hey man, I really like your pad.

288
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,840
Those lava lamps are far out.

289
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,720
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

290
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,360
It's no problem, brother.

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,760
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose.

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
You dig what I'm saying?

293
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,960
I dig it, man.

294
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,640
We should throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

295
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,240
Yeah, man, that would be groovy.

296
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
Hey, I got to split for a while.

297
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Are you okay here by yourself?

298
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Don't worry about me, brother.

299
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,320
You go take care of your business.

300
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
All right.

301
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Peace out.

302
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
All right.

303
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,840
So 1960s, very famous among rock music, the peace and conflicts and all this stuff.

304
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Yeah, that's right.

305
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:08,200
I guess in English or Anglo pop culture, we look back at this decade very fondly.

306
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Yeah.

307
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,240
And also we really related to the hippie movement, right?

308
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,840
People with long hair and baggy clothes, living in their cars, going from concert to concert.

309
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Yeah.

310
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,400
And I mean, speaking of music, I think if we think 1960s, at least in Anglo world, we

311
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,080
think of the best music.

312
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,320
I think this is the golden age of music in English speaking countries.

313
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes, it was a very good era.

314
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,760
And well, what do you guys think?

315
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,800
Do you think the 60s was the best decade or maybe you are more fond of the 70s, the disco

316
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
era?

317
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Or even the 90s.

318
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,960
There's some pretty good music in 1994.

319
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Exactly.

320
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,720

Bye.
