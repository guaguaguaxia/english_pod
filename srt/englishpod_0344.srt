00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,720
My name is Catherine and today we're traveling a little bit and we need to book a hotel room.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
That's right.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,160
So today we're going to learn all the words and phrases that will help you talk to the

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
receptionist in order to book a hotel room.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
Let's check out our dialogue.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Madison Sweets, how may I help you?

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
I will be in town in a few minutes.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

18
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm sorry, I'm not available.

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,540
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability?

20
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,820
Ok, ma'am.

21
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,080
Can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

22
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,580
Yes, July ninth.

23
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,720
I will be there for seven nights.

24
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,320
We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.

25
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
What's the difference?

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
bed and minibar.

28
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,760
Ok, I would like to reserve the superior suite.

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,880
Is breakfast included?

30
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,520
Yes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning.

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,160
I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.

32
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Sure.

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
My credit card number is...

34
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,480
All right.

35
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,280
We're back.

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,860
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

37
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,360
Language takeaway.

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,000
So we've got a lot of great phrases and words today in language takeaway.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,480
The first one comes from the beginning of the dialogue.

40
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
It's availability.

41
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,560
All right.

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,840
So the woman wanted to know if the hotel has availability.

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,200
So what does that mean?

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,120
That means, do you have free rooms?

45
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Do you have any rooms I could rent?

46
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,840
So instead of saying, do you have any free rooms or do you have rooms available?

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,800
You can just say, do you have availability?

48
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
That's right.

49
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,280
So you're basically asking the person, do you have anything available?

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,320
So what's your availability?

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Very good.

52
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Okay.

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
All right.

54
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,440
So we have availability and obviously the receptionist needs to know when we expect

55
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,320
to check in.

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,160
So this is a noun and a verb, but in today's dialogue, it's used as a verb.

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,440
So it's something we do to check in.

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,600
So the person on the phone would like to know what date you expect to check in.

59
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,040
That means when will you arrive at our hotel?

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
That's right.

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,840
So maybe we will arrive to the city a couple of days before we check into the hotel.

62
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,640
So we really specifically want to know when are you going to start sleeping here?

63
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
That's right.

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,680
And the opposite, so when you leave the hotel, is called check out, to check out.

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
That's right.

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Okay.

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,480
So we want to check in on July 9th and the receptionist tells us that we have available

68
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,280
a single suite or a double suite.

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
All right.

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,760
So these are two different kinds of rooms.

71
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,040
Now a suite is different from a room because it actually means that the space you're going

72
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,560
to use is more than one room, maybe two rooms or three.

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
That's right.

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,880
So it's a little bit bigger than just a standard room.

75
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,640
It might have a sitting area or a kitchen area.

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,480
So that's what a suite is.

77
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,680
Very expensive rooms are suites as well.

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,720
They have a sitting area and a kitchen and maybe even an extra bedroom.

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
That's right.

80
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Okay.

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,160
So we have a single suite.

82
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,200
That means that we have one of these big rooms that is only for one person.

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,120
And the double suite means that two or more people can sleep there.

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
That's right.

85
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,840
So single will be one person and double will be two people.

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,200
And we also heard similar words with the beds because sometimes the rooms aren't really

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
clear about what kind of beds they have.

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,780
So this person asked, what's the difference between these rooms?

89
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,000
And the hotel employee answered, well, the junior suite has one twin bed.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,080
All right.

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
What's a twin bed?

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
So a twin bed is basically a bed that's only for one person.

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,320
Only one person fits in there.

94
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
All right.

95
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,600
So it's a single bed basically.

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
We call it a twin.

97
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
It's a standard size.

98
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,480
So everywhere you go, a twin is always for one person.

99
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
That's right.

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
All right.

101
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
And if you want to have another person in bed, we have to get a bigger one.

102
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,320
And what's that bigger bed called?

103
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,800
It's called a double bed.

104
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
A double bed.

105
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
So again, double.

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Double room, double bed.

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,840
So this means that two people can sleep on the one bed.

108
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
That's right.

109
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,680
So this is important because sometimes you want to book a hotel room and it will be a

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
double suite, but it will have two twin beds.

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
All right.

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
So it's a double room.

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,240
So it's for two people, but each person has their own small bed.

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
That's right.

115
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Two twin beds.

116
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Mm-hmm.

117
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Okay.

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,600
And lastly, the superior double suite not only had a double bed, but also had a mini

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
bar.

120
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
A mini bar.

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
So you know what a bar is?

122
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,240
It's a place you go to get some alcohol or some drinks, but a mini bar is a little bit

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
different, right?

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Mm-hmm.

125
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,280
It's a little refrigerator or a little area where you will have snacks and drinks that

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,120
you can just basically take freely, but obviously you will have to pay afterwards.

127
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
That's right.

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,600
So you can take them when you're staying there, but when you check out, when you leave, you

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,280
have to pay for everything you ate or drank.

130
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
That's right.

131
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay.

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,800
So a lot of words there on Language Takeaway today.

133
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,720
Let's take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,640
Madison Suites, how may I help you?

135
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,400
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability.

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Okay, ma'am.

138
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

139
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,640
Yes, July 9th.

140
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,760
I will be there for seven nights.

141
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,440
We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.

142
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
What's the difference?

143
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,000
The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed while the superior suite has a double

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,160
bed and mini bar.

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Okay.

146
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,840
I would like to reserve the superior suite.

147
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Is breakfast included?

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,600
Yes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning.

149
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,200
I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.

150
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Sure.

151
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,200
My credit card number is...

152
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
All right.

153
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
So now it's time for some phrases.

154
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Let's start with Fluency Builder.

155
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
Fluency Builder.

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,080
The first phrase in Fluency Builder might seem a little bit strange.

157
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,760
It's I will be in town next week.

158
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
I'll be in town.

159
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,280
In what town?

160
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
That's right.

161
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,160
Well, if you say I will be in town, that basically says I will be in this town.

162
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
I will be there.

163
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
I will be here.

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,360
So, I'll be in the town you're in.

165
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,680
This is interesting.

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,960
So, when I'm talking to someone, maybe Marco is in Chicago and I'm in New York.

167
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,040
I call and say, hey, Marco, I'll be in town next week.

168
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
What are you doing?

169
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Right.

170
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm going to be in Chicago.

171
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I want to have a drink.

172
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
That means I'm going to be where?

173
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
You're going to be in Chicago.

174
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
That's right.

175
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll be in Chicago like Marco is.

176
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm not going to talk about where I am now.

177
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,040
This usually means I'm going somewhere else.

178
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
That's right.

179
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,520
So, actually, you can tell your friends that you're going to be in town or sometimes you

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,200
have to tell someone you're going to be out of town.

181
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'll be out of town.

182
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
That means I won't be where I am now.

183
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I won't be in New York.

184
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,360
I'll be somewhere else.

185
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,640
I'll be in Chicago.

186
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
That's right.

187
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
All right.

188
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,080
So, we had one where when we were talking specifically about the hotel and maybe what

189
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,120
is included with our suite, we asked a very important question.

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Is breakfast included?

191
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Included in what?

192
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
In the price.

193
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
All right.

194
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,120
So, this is a very common question like you're saying, Marco, but it's not obvious.

195
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,480
So when you ask, is breakfast included?

196
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,880
That means do I have to pay extra for breakfast?

197
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,720
If breakfast is included, I don't have to pay.

198
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,800
If it's not included, that means I have to pay extra for breakfast.

199
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
That's right.

200
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,880
And in this case, breakfast is included, but not just any breakfast.

201
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
It's a buffet breakfast.

202
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,760
My favorite kind of breakfast.

203
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,540
So, this is pretty common with hotels.

204
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,240
They will serve a buffet breakfast from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. or whatever.

205
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,720
A buffet means that there's a room with tables and food on the tables.

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Right.

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
So, you don't order food.

208
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
You just take whatever you want.

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
That's right.

210
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,320
So, you can take whatever you want and usually as much as you want.

211
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
That's the best part.

212
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay.

213
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,800
So, now we know that breakfast is included.

214
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,160
We know what a room is like.

215
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,420
So, we're going to make the reservation and the hotel employee says that he needs our

216
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,920
credit card details to complete the reservation.

217
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Credit card details.

218
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,280
Now, you might be wondering what details.

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,640
Credit card details means the specific information on your credit card.

220
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
All right.

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,120
So, it's pretty common when you're making a purchase on the phone or on the internet.

222
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
You have to enter.

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,080
You have to provide your credit card details.

224
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Right.

225
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,360
That means your name, your credit card number, and the expiration date which is when the

226
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,920
card will no longer be useful.

227
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,120
So, it's necessary because obviously you can say, yeah, I'm going to be there tomorrow

228
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,720
and then you don't show up and the hotel loses money.

229
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
So, they need to make sure that they have you somehow.

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah.

231
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
That's their way of protecting themselves.

232
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,480
They want to give you the room but they also don't want to lose money.

233
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Okay.

234
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,160
So, let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
more.

236
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Madison Sweets, how may I help you?

237
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Yes, I am calling from Mexico.

238
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability.

239
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Okay, ma'am.

240
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Can you tell me the date you expect to check in?

241
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Yes, July 9th.

242
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
I will be there for seven nights.

243
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
We have a reservation.

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm going to be there for seven nights.

245
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Okay.

246
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm going to be there for seven nights.

247
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm going to be there for seven nights.

248
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Okay.

249
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm going to be there for seven nights.

250
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Okay.

251
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm going to be there for seven nights.

252
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Okay.

253
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm going to be there for seven nights.

254
00:09:46,160 --> 00:10:00,920
Okay.

255
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
All right.

256
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,880
So, talking about hotels, I think one of the most important things out of this, well, not

257
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,320
important but also something that you should know is that the minibar is always so expensive.

258
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,080
It is expensive.

259
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Be very careful when you're going into that minibar.

260
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
Sometimes it seems like a really good idea.

261
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,840
You're hungry and there are crackers or you want a beer.

262
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,560
But you have to look at the menu because the menu will have the prices and maybe something

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,600
that's really cheap in a store outside is really expensive at a hotel.

264
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,760
And I think sometimes, I don't know, sometimes it's even hard to find that little menu so

265
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,200
you don't even know what the prices are.

266
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,080
But you're so thirsty, you just want to have something to drink now and it ends up costing

267
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
you $10.

268
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
So, be careful.

269
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,560
Anytime you're in a hotel room, expect the prices to be pretty high for the things in

270
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
the hotel.

271
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,640
Unless, of course, there's a sign or a piece of paper that says that something is free

272
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
or complimentary.

273
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,160
Yeah, that's right.

274
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,000
Complimentary water is very common in hotels.

275
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
They'll give you two free bottles of water.

276
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
That's right.

277
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,720
So, complimentary means you don't have to pay for it.

278
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,480
But if there's no sign, then expect to pay a lot.

279
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
That's right.

280
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Okay.

281
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
