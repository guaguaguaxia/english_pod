00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,840
Katherine – My name is Katherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson for you

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
English learners out there.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Marco – That's right.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,840
On this occasion, we are going on a diet.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,400
So we're trying to lose weight.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Katherine – Uh-oh.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
Well, there's a reason behind it.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
Let's take a look at that reason in today's vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600
Marco – All right.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,160
So today on Vocabulary Preview, we have a noun and it's a bridesmaid.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,440
Katherine – A bridesmaid, a person.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,040
So this is kind of like a job but it's a short job.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,360
You do it when your friend gets married.

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,640
It's the person, the woman who stands next to her friend on the friend's wedding day.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Marco – That's right.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,600
And usually bridesmaids want to lose weight because they have to get into this dress,

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
right?

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Katherine – That's right.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
They have special dresses.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,400
They have to make their friend look good.

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,320
They have to match each other actually because usually there's three or four girls.

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,440
They all have to wear the same outfit.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
So it's very stressful.

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Marco – Okay.

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
All right.

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,960
So we're going to see what's going on in this dialogue and we'll be back shortly.

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh man, I've been starving myself for days now and I haven't lost an ounce.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,240
Are you trying to lose weight?

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,000
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,700
Look at these love handles.

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,480
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,240
I think that's where you're going wrong.

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Why?

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Not really.

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,200
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats.

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,960
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,440
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat?

43
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Yes.

44
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,720
You should also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,000
cholesterol.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,100
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,360
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Don't count on it.

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
All right.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
We're back.

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,040
So I think there were a lot of interesting words related to food and to losing weight.

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,360
So why don't we take a look now at language takeaway.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Language takeaway.

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,280
Okay, this first phrase in language takeaway is a phrase that the girl says about herself.

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,600
She's trying to lose weight.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,680
She's been starving herself or she says, I've been starving myself.

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
All right.

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,580
I've been starving myself.

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,800
So to starve yourself is to make yourself not eat.

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
That's right.

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
So to starve is a verb.

62
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,880
It means to not give someone food.

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,600
But to starve yourself, to starve oneself is reflexive.

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,240
I'm doing it to myself and it means that I'm not giving myself any food.

65
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Okay.

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,080
So you're starving yourself basically to lose weight.

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,660
And she said, well, I've been starving myself for days and I haven't lost an ounce.

68
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,660
What is an ounce?

69
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
It's a good question.

70
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,560
An ounce is a kind of weight.

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,000
So like a kilogram or a gram or a pound, but an ounce is a very, very small measurement.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And this is in the imperial system.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,520
So maybe a lot of our listeners aren't familiar with it, but usually for example, pounds and

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,760
ounces go together just like grams and kilograms.

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Exactly.

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
So I might be wrong.

78
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,160
I think there are 16 ounces in a pound.

79
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,680
So if you think about it, a pound, you say, oh, I lost a pound.

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
16 ounces.

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
She hasn't even lost an ounce.

82
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,720
It's a way to say she hasn't lost any weight yet.

83
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
All right.

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
So she was complaining about not losing weight and she said, look at these love handles.

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
What are love handles?

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,800
I love this phrase because you can like imagine them.

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,920
So imagine hugging someone and your hands are on their waist and maybe they have a little

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
extra fat.

89
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,360
Those are like love handles.

90
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,520
You know, a handle is what you have on a door.

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
You turn the handle and the door opens.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
But these are, this is fat on someone's side.

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,600
So a man or a woman can have fat on their hips and this is called love handles.

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Okay.

95
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
So love handles.

96
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,040
It's a nice way of saying that extra little fat that people have on their sides.

97
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
All right.

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,440
And now talking more specifically about words related to food, we have one that maybe most

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,480
of you are familiar with, calories.

100
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Calories.

101
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,120
So calorie is a measurement of energy in food.

102
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,280
And so a lot of women and some men too like to avoid eating many calories.

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,360
They say, oh, that Snickers bar that has 1000 calories.

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
That's right.

105
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,320
If actually, if you look at your food labels, it usually says that you should have a daily

106
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
diet should include more or less 2000 calories.

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Exactly.

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
All right.

109
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,760
Another thing to avoid are saturated fats.

110
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Okay.

111
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,920
So there's fat and there's saturated fat.

112
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,200
Marco, what's the difference?

113
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,840
I have no idea.

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Come on.

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,600
There are two different types of fats.

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Some of them are good for you.

117
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,800
Your body needs fat, right?

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,320
But saturated fats are the ones that are more difficult for your body to absorb and to make

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,900
them work for you.

120
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,800
So usually they accumulate and that's why maybe they will, for example, make you a little

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,040
bit fatter.

122
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,280
So a lot of sweets have saturated fats.

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,120
Oily foods have saturated fats and it's good to avoid those.

124
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Right.

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,840
So stay away from saturated fats and artificial flavors.

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,600
So the word artificial can be used with many different things.

127
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
It means fake, not natural.

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,080
So you could say you have artificial flowers or artificial scents.

129
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
But in this case, we have artificial flavors.

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,000
That means fake flavors.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,820
It's orange flavored, but there's no oranges.

132
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,720
It never came from an orange.

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,760
You have to be careful with these because they use, because in many food products, chemicals

134
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
are used.

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Right.

136
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
And sugars, for example.

137
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,880
So as you said, if you want to make something taste like orange, maybe they will use different

138
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,040
chemicals and sugars to make it taste like orange.

139
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Exactly.

140
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,200
The last thing we have to avoid is this word cholesterol.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Cholesterol.

142
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay.

143
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,160
So these are found, for example, in eggs have a lot of cholesterol.

144
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,940
Or even just meats in general, like red meat.

145
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,440
And so people with heart problems are told to avoid cholesterol because it can actually,

146
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
it can prevent the blood going to your heart.

147
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
It blocks up your heart.

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,960
So cholesterol is another bad one.

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
All right.

150
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,480
So all of these words are nouns and they're related to dieting and to food.

151
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,880
So I think we should listen to this dialogue again and keep a lookout for these words.

152
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,120
Oh man, I've been starving myself for days now and I haven't lost an ounce.

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,520
Are you trying to lose weight?

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

155
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,200
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

156
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,880
Look at these love handles.

157
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,600
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

158
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,480
I think that's where you're going wrong.

159
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Why?

160
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,520
If I eat less than my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

161
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Not really.

162
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats.

163
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,160
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

164
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,600
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat?

165
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes.

166
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,200
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol.

167
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,300
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

168
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,560
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
Don't count on it.

170
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
All right, we're back.

171
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,240
We're going to take a look at two phrases on Fluency Builder.

172
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Fluency Builder.

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Okay, this first phrase is something that the girl who is dieting says.

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,880
She says, are you saying that I should eat?

175
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,640
Because she's starving herself.

176
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,720
But that the important thing is that I watch what I eat.

177
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,200
So what is this watch what I eat?

178
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
All right.

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,200
So to watch what you eat is to be careful of what you eat or to take care.

180
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,240
So it doesn't actually mean to look at your food a lot.

181
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,880
You don't have to stare at your food.

182
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,520
You just have to be careful or to pay attention to what you're eating.

183
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,460
So you should watch what you eat.

184
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,200
So that means pay attention.

185
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,960
Does it have lots of calories?

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,680
Is there a lot of cholesterol?

187
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Things like this.

188
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Right.

189
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,680
For example, you may see signs in some places that say, watch your step.

190
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,640
So be careful where you're stepping.

191
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Okay.

192
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,920
Well, this next phrase is the very last phrase.

193
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,540
The friend says, do you think I can lose 20 pounds?

194
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,240
And for those of you who use kilos, this is about eight kilos.

195
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
That's a lot of weight.

196
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
And the answer is don't count on it.

197
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
So what is this don't count on it?

198
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
All right.

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Don't count on it.

200
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
Take that as a phrase.

201
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,660
It basically means that probably won't happen.

202
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,920
So you think you can come to my birthday party?

203
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,280
No, don't count on it.

204
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I'll be busy.

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh, so that means that means he probably won't.

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Marco probably won't come.

207
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Right.

208
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,040
So you shouldn't expect it to happen because he can't promise that it will.

209
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Yeah.

210
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
That's a good way of putting it.

211
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Don't expect it to happen.

212
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,960
So for example, don't count on winning the lottery anytime soon.

213
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Why not?

214
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,920
Because it's very difficult, right?

215
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,200
So don't count on it.

216
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,480
Or you can say, don't count on this train being on time.

217
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
It's always at least a half an hour late.

218
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Exactly.

219
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
All right.

220
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
So many different examples there.

221
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,040
I think we should listen to a dialogue for the last time.

222
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:46,920
Oh man, I've been starving myself for days now and I haven't lost an ounce.

223
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
Are you trying to lose weight?

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,360
Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

225
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,960
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

226
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,660
Look at these love handles.

227
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,440
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,240
I think that's where you're going wrong.

229
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Why?

230
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,280
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

231
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Not really.

232
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,160
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts, or saturated fats.

233
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,920
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

234
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,440
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat?

235
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Yes.

236
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,960
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol.

237
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,060
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

238
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,320
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

239
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Don't count on it.

240
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,920
Alright, we're back.

241
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,960
So these are some pretty healthy tips, right?

242
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Watch what you eat and don't starve yourself.

243
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Absolutely.

244
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,100
Starving yourself, I think is, well, obviously very unhealthy.

245
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,320
To starve, to die of starvation, that's the noun.

246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,920
Not a very pretty way to go.

247
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,400
I've actually also heard that people that start to eat less, right?

248
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,280
To maybe just eat once a day, their body actually thinks that there isn't much food around,

249
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,120
so they start to store up these fats and these calories, energy, instead of releasing them

250
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
normally.

251
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,720
So instead of actually losing weight, you actually gain weight because the moment that

252
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,600
you eat, your body stores everything.

253
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Exactly.

254
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,840
So instead of getting rid of those good fats, your body stores them with the saturated fats

255
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,880
and you are doing the opposite to your body that you should be doing.

256
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,800
So the best recommendation that I've always heard is to avoid eating too much red meat,

257
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,640
balance your diet out, eat lots of fruit as well, have those good sugars, and avoid artificial

258
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
foods.

259
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Drink a lot of water.

260
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Drink a lot of water and exercise.

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Exercise, yeah.

262
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
This is the key thing.

263
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,720
I think many people rely only on dieting or eating less, but actually nothing can take

264
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,600
its place more than exercise.

265
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,480
And exercise is really great because it tones those muscles, so once you actually lose the

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,000
weight, you feel good, you have muscles, you have more energy, and it helps you sleep.

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Right.

268
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All right.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,400
