00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm joined here today with...

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
Erika.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
And my name is Marco.

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,640
And we're going to be looking at an office lesson today.

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
That's right.

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,160
We've got a lesson about describing somebody who's not such a good employee.

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Right.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
So we're going to be talking about how to describe this type of situation and language

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
for making your point.

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
Yes.

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,760
So let's look at some vocabulary from the dialogue in Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,160
So two words today.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,440
The first one is a good fit.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,520
A good fit.

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,480
A good fit.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
A good fit.

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,920
So when we're talking about an employee and he's a good fit, it means he's suitable for

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
the job.

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Yes.

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,560
He's suitable for the job or for the company.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,160
For the company, right?

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,840
So the opposite would be not a good fit.

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Exactly.

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
The title of today's lesson.

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Right.

28
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,280
And our last word for Vocabulary Preview, performance.

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Performance.

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Performance.

31
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Performance.

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,200
Your performance is...

33
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,760
How good or bad you do your job.

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Right.

35
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,240
So you can have good performance or bad performance.

36
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,920
Just how well you do your job.

37
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Perfect.

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,840
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time and as always, it's going

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,440
to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it.

40
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,440
Because we'll come back and explain all the key language.

41
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:35,200
Now we're going to listen as two managers discuss the performance of one employee.

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
So Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative,

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Jason Huntley.

44
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Sure.

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
What's up?

46
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,000
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,760
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

48
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Okay.

49
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
What makes you say that?

50
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,240
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

51
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,480
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,280
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times...

54
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
Take last Tuesday, for instance.

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,600
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
But that's not the only thing.

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,320
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

60
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,440
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,480
Look, you hired this guy.

63
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,320
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,200
So now it's up to you to coach him.

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,760
Make it work, Jeff.

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,840
Make it work, Jeff.

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,320
You would say that, wouldn't you?

68
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
He is your cousin.

69
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
What a jerk.

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,880
Making me hire his stupid, useless cousin.

71
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,280
So apparently, Lauren hired her cousin.

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Yes.

73
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,840
That's always a complicated situation working with family members.

74
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,760
Yeah, it makes it really difficult for Jeff, doesn't it?

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,880
Yeah, and apparently Jeff isn't very happy.

76
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,240
Well, let's look at the language he used to tell us that he's unhappy about this.

77
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,480
Language takeaway.

78
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,200
Okay, the first word on language takeaway today.

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Unreliable.

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Unreliable.

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Unreliable.

82
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Unreliable.

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,360
So, let's listen to some examples of unreliable so then you can understand what it means.

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Example one.

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,800
The trains here are so unreliable.

86
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,320
They never arrive on time.

87
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,960
Example two.

88
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Thomas is pretty unreliable.

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:50,000
He never finishes his projects on time.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Example three.

91
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,240
You promised you would pick me up from work today.

92
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,200
You're so unreliable.

93
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,000
We can understand that if someone is unreliable, we can't trust them to do their job, right?

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Right.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
So you don't want to be unreliable.

96
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,040
The opposite would be?

97
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Reliable.

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Reliable.

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
You can trust them.

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Right.

101
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Our second word today.

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Productive.

103
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Productive.

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Productive.

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Productive.

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,120
When you're productive, it means that you accomplish your job, right?

107
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,240
You do a lot of work in a short amount of time.

108
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Productive.

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Mm-hmm.

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
You want to be a productive employee.

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Yes.

112
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,920
Our third word, work ethic.

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
Work ethic.

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
Work ethic.

115
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Work ethic.

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
So a person's work ethic is that person's attitude towards work.

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Yes.

118
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,680
If they have a good work ethic, then they are always hardworking and they come to work

119
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,920
early and they finish their jobs on time and they stay and do lots of overtime.

120
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,160
So that's a good work ethic.

121
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,540
Okay, great.

123
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,960
And our last word, coach.

124
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Coach.

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Coach.

126
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Coach.

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,960
When you coach an employee, you train them, right?

128
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Yeah, you help that employee out by showing him or her how to do certain tasks.

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
Or how to do their job better.

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Right.

131
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,680
So we've got some great language to describe work performance.

132
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,080
This time it'll be a little bit slower so you can understand these words and phrases

134
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:29,040
a little bit more clearly.

135
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,640
So Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative,

136
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
Jason Huntley.

137
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
Sure.

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
What's up?

139
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,920
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him.

140
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,440
And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

141
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,560
Okay.

142
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
What makes you say that?

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,520
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

144
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,880
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

145
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,360
Yeah, his attitude is great.

146
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,400
But he's really unreliable.

147
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Sometimes he's really productive.

148
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,280
But then other times...

149
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,320
Take last Tuesday for instance.

150
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,920
He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

151
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,120
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

152
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,320
But that's not the only thing.

153
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

156
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

157
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,480
Look, you hired this guy.

158
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,400
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

159
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,240
So now it's up to you to coach him.

160
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,320
Make it work, Jeff.

161
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,120
You would say that, wouldn't you?

162
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
He is your cousin.

163
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
What a jerk.

164
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,320
Make me hire your stupid, useless cousin.

165
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,960
All right, so if you noticed, a lot of useful phrases have come up.

166
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,280
So let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

167
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Fluency Builder.

168
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,640
Fluency Builder, today we have three phrases.

169
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
That's right.

170
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,400
Three phrases that will help us make our point better.

171
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,760
The first one is bottom line.

172
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,960
The bottom line.

173
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,640
The bottom line.

174
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,680
Let's listen to how this was used in the dialogue.

175
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,280
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

176
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,960
And the bottom line is, I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

177
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
So basically it means...

178
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,800
Like the most important point.

179
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
The most important point.

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Perfect.

181
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,460
The bottom line.

182
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,440
Our second word, overall.

183
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Overall.

184
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Overall.

185
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Overall.

186
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,520
So this is the same as saying on the whole.

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Right.

188
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,000
So it's a big picture, how you would say.

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
Yeah, in general.

190
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,280
In general.

191
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,320
So his overall performance is good.

192
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,880
It means in general.

193
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,360
His performance is good.

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Perfect.

195
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,240
And our last phrase is very interesting because we can mix it up a little bit.

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Yep.

197
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Perfectly good.

198
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Perfectly good.

199
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Perfectly good.

200
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,120
Perfectly good.

201
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,720
So this is an interesting phrase because you can describe different objects in this way.

202
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Yeah.

203
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
A perfectly good reason.

204
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,080
A perfectly good car.

205
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,720
A perfectly good computer.

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,040
So by the sounds of it, it's kind of like justifying.

207
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Yeah.

208
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,680
It's saying there's no problem with it.

209
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
There's no problem with it.

210
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,040
Why would you throw it away if it's a perfectly good computer?

211
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Exactly.

212
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Okay.

213
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Perfectly good.

214
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Okay.

215
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,240
So now we can listen to our dialogue a third time at a normal speed and now we're ready

216
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
to understand everything.

217
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:58,200
So, Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative,

218
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Jason Huntley.

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Sure.

220
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
What's up?

221
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him and the bottom line is I don't think he's

222
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,720
a good fit for our company.

223
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Okay.

224
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
What makes you say that?

225
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,280
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance.

226
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,560
Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Yeah.

228
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,240
His attitude is great, but he's really unreliable.

229
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,720
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times, take last Tuesday for instance,

230
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,680
he was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

231
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,240
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

232
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,880
But that's not the only thing.

233
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,120
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,480
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

235
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Yeah, but come on, Jeff.

236
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,560
As if you don't check Facebook at work.

237
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Look, you hired this guy.

238
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,360
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

239
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,240
So now it's up to you to coach him.

240
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,800
Make it work, Jeff.

241
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
Make it work, Jeff.

242
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,360
You would say that, wouldn't you?

243
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
He is your cousin.

244
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
What a jerk.

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,480
Making me hire your stupid, useless cousin.

246
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Okay.

247
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,360
I hope everyone enjoyed our lesson today.

248
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,120
We've found some really useful vocabulary for a business situation.

249
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,560
So go to our website at EnglishPod.com where you can leave all your questions and comments

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
That's right.

252
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,280
Marco and I are always on the site and we're happy to answer your questions.

253
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Right.

254
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
So until then, it's goodbye.

255
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:39,700
Bye.
