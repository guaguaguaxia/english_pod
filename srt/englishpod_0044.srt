00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,840
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,200
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all our elementary learners.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
You know what, Marco?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,840
I think this lesson is so useful.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,200
This is language that you can actually use every single day.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,640
Exactly, every day.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
Exactly, because today we're going to be teaching you small talk.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,840
So what is small talk?

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,880
Well, small talk is small conversations that you would have with people that you don't

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,800
know very well, but you still want to be polite.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Yes.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Right?

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920
And you want to maybe just chat a little bit.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,960
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue.

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,120
And as always, it's going to be a little bit fast, but don't worry about it.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
Because we'll come back in a minute and help you with some of the difficult language.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,000
Morning.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,320
Hi there, Mr. Anderson.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
How are you on this fine morning?

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Fine.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,680
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,800
I barely even got out of bed.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,200
Yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Did you catch the news this morning?

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,720
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,080
No, I didn't hear about that.

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,360
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,560
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,640
No, I don't like football.

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,160
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,600
She's really beautiful.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
She's my wife.

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,280
Oh, here's my floor.

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Nice talking to you.

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Goodbye.

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,320
Oh, sir, this is the 56th floor.

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
We're on the 70th.

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
That's okay.

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,320
I'll take the stairs.

42
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,080
Okay, I think this guy was a little bit annoying.

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,520
Yeah, Mr. Anderson really didn't want to talk to him, did he?

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, I think that was pretty obvious.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
He left the elevator in a hurry.

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,440
Okay, let's take a look at our language today in Language Takeaway.

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Language Takeaway.

48
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,080
All right, what do we have today in Language Takeaway?

49
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,440
Well, we've got four words and phrases and our first one is barely even.

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,620
Barely even.

51
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,620
Barely even.

52
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,200
So how do we use barely even?

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
It's a little bit difficult.

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,280
It's really similar to like almost couldn't or almost nothing or almost can't.

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,040
So we use it usually in a negative sense.

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,280
For example, I could say, I was so busy today, I could barely even eat my lunch.

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Okay, so I can maybe say, it was so dark, I could barely even see.

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,760
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,320
Or I'm so poor, I can barely even pay my rent.

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,920
Okay, good.

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Barely even.

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,600
All right, let's take a look at our next one.

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Catch.

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Catch.

65
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Catch.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Did you catch the news?

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,480
So by did you catch the news, you mean did you hear the news?

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Exactly.

69
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,520
So how else can we use this?

70
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Did you catch?

71
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,560
A really common one is, I didn't catch your name.

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
Yeah, I didn't hear your name.

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
I didn't hear your name.

74
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,200
Yeah, and we can also say, I didn't catch what he said.

75
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
I didn't catch what he said, yeah.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
So I didn't hear.

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Yeah.

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Okay, let's look at our next word.

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
By the way.

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,800
By the way.

81
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
By the way.

82
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
By the way.

83
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,360
Okay, so let's listen to some examples first of how we can use by the way and then we'll

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,920
come back and talk more about it.

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
Example one.

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
Are you going to be at the meeting today?

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Yeah, I'll be there.

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,880
Oh, by the way, did you hear what happened today?

89
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,920
Example two.

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,040
By the way, I almost forgot to tell you, Maggie called.

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,960
Okay, so I see that when we say by the way, we're introducing a point after we've already

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
talked about something.

93
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Exactly, and maybe it's not even related to the topic we were talking about.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,320
No, it's a different topic.

95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Different topic, right?

96
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,680
It's like saying, oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Exactly.

98
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,120
So it's like, oh, Erica, don't forget we have a meeting today.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,520
Oh, and by the way, I like your new haircut.

100
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Thanks, Marco.

101
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
All right, see?

102
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Yeah.

103
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
That's the way you would use by the way.

104
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Okay, and our last word on language takeaway.

105
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Take the stairs.

106
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
Take the stairs.

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,820
Take the stairs.

108
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
Take the stairs.

109
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,200
So it doesn't mean you're going to take them somewhere.

110
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,240
No, no, you're not taking them home with you.

111
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,440
It means you're going to go up the stairs.

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,280
Okay, so take the stairs.

113
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,640
Yes, a lot of people might say use the stairs or go up the stairs, but our EnglishPod learners,

114
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
they know, right?

115
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
To use take the stairs.

116
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Yep.

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Take the stairs.

118
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,920
Okay, so now we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

119
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

120
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:48,600
And this will help you to catch these phrases a little bit better.

121
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Morning.

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
Hi there, Mr. Anderson.

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,280
How are you on this fine morning?

124
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,800
Fine, thank you.

125
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,200
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

126
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,880
I barely even got out of bed.

127
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,040
It's pretty cold, all right.

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,280
Did you catch the news this morning?

129
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,440
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

130
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,600
No, I didn't hear about that.

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,760
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

133
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,200
No, I don't like football.

134
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,840
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

135
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
She's really beautiful.

136
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
She's my wife.

137
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,440
Oh, here's my floor.

138
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,960
Nice talking to you.

139
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Goodbye.

140
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, sir, this is the 56th floor.

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
We're on the 70th.

142
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
That's okay.

143
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I'll take the stairs.

144
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:53,080
Okay, so now let's take a look at ways to start up some small talk in putting it together.

145
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Putting it together.

146
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,000
So Marco, today we've got some great patterns or structures that you can use in your small

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
talk.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, exactly.

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We saw some great patterns.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,240
Let's start with the first one.

151
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,160
It sure is cold this morning.

152
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,400
It sure is cold.

153
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,840
It sure is cold.

154
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,320
It sure is cold.

155
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,800
Okay, so we can change it up a little bit and say, it sure is hot.

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Or it sure is late.

157
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Okay, this sure is interesting.

158
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,000
Or you could say, he sure is smart.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
So basically, you can change the adjective.

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Yes.

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Cold, hot, smart, hard, difficult.

162
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,600
And when you say, sure is, this is a great way of emphasizing that you believe this adjective

163
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
to be true.

164
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
Okay, it sure is.

165
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,280
Now what would be the answer to this?

166
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,240
Well, in the dialogue, Mr. Anderson said, yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

167
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,960
It's pretty cold, all right.

168
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
It's pretty cold, all right.

169
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,480
So again, using the examples we used before, we can say, oh, it's pretty hot, all right.

170
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,400
Or it's pretty late, all right.

171
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,880
Or he's pretty smart, all right.

172
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,480
Or this is pretty interesting, all right.

173
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
So it means you're agreeing with that person.

174
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Exactly.

175
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Okay, great.

176
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,500
So Marco, these things, it sure is blank and yeah, it's blank, all right.

177
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,640
These can go together really well, can't they?

178
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,720
Yeah, as a question and answer format, they go well.

179
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,720
So why don't we listen to some examples of how these two phrases work together.

180
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
Example one.

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,320
It sure is a nice day today.

182
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,960
Yeah, it's nice, all right.

183
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,160
Example two.

184
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
The bus is sure late today.

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,680
Yeah, it's late, all right.

186
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Example three.

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
This class is really hard.

188
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,440
Yeah, it's hard, all right.

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay, so now let's take a look at our next word and putting it together.

190
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,320
Did you happen to...

191
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
Did you happen to...

192
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you happen to...

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
Did you happen to...

194
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
Did you happen to see Bob this morning?

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
I didn't happen to see Bob.

196
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
So it means like...

197
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,800
Like, did you by chance...

198
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,840
By chance, did you by chance see Bob or something.

199
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Yeah.

200
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,000
Another example would be, did you happen to go to that restaurant I recommended?

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Or maybe, do you happen to have a pen?

202
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,240
Do you happen to know where the bathroom is?

203
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,040
Yeah, that's a really useful one.

204
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
That's a good useful one.

205
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,440
That's basically how you would use this structure.

206
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,560
Did you happen to...

207
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,880
Do you happen to...

208
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,360
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the third time and I'm sure that you'll be able

209
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,840
to understand everything.

210
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,120
Morning.

211
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,920
Hi there, Mr. Anderson.

212
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,720
How are you on this fine morning?

213
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
Fine, thank you.

214
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,320
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

215
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,480
I barely even got out of bed.

216
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

217
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,480
Did you catch the news this morning?

218
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,360
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

219
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,680
No, I didn't hear about that.

220
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,960
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

221
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,200
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
No, I don't like football.

223
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,800
By the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

224
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
She's really beautiful.

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
She's my wife.

226
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
Oh, here's my floor.

227
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Nice talking to you.

228
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Goodbye.

229
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Oh, sir, this is the 56th floor.

230
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,240
We're on the 70th.

231
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
That's okay.

232
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,720
I'll take the stairs.

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,960
All right, Marco, that was a really useful dialogue for daily life, wasn't it?

234
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,560
Yeah, I think you can find a lot of useful language there and that you can apply tomorrow.

235
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Yeah.

236
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,800
Well, speaking of useful things, let's talk a little bit about our website.

237
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,120
