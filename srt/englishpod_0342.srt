00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,760
And we're in the mood to read something today, so we're going to a place called the library,

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
right?

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
That's right.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,880
We're going to go to the library and we're going to get some books.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,440
But before we do that, let's take a look at a word in vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
All right.

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,960
So, today's vocabulary preview word is a thing that you use when you go to the library to

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
take that book home.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
You don't have to pay for the book.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,560
You use your library card to borrow it.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,560
That's right.

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,200
So, this is something that you need when you want to get books at the library.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,480
You need a library card.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,200
So, we're going to talk about this and how you get a library card.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,960
So, let's listen to the dialogue.

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,900
Wow!

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,720
Look at all these books.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,000
I bet I can find a book about anything here.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shh!

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Please keep your voice down.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,840
There are people reading and studying here.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,960
Okay.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,960
Are you the librarian?

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,040
Maybe you can help me.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
I am looking for a book.

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,360
Yes, I am.

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,640
You can check our online catalog to search for the book you want based on the genre,

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,800
title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,800
That would be in our children's section.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,920
That bookshelf there on the right.

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,620
Okay.

38
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,180
I would like to check out these books.

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,080
Do you have a library card?

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
No.

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
How do I get one?

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,360
I just need to see your driver's license or utility bill to prove that you are a resident

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
of this state.

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Here you go.

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,560
So, you're all set.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,400
You can have these books for two weeks.

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,480
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,840
If you don't, you get charged 10 cents a day for each book.

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Okay.

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Thanks.

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
All right.

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
We're back.

53
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,960
So, now, let's start with Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
All right.

56
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,400
We have a lot of great things for you today in Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,160
The first is actually a job.

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
This is a person who works at a library.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
What's that person called?

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
He or she is called a librarian.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
All right.

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,040
So, someone who works at a library is a librarian.

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
That's right.

64
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,760
So, this person organizes the books, knows about all the books that are there, and basically

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,240
takes care of the library.

66
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
That's right.

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,120
So, if you need help in the library, it's probably a good idea to ask the librarian

68
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,680
where the book you're looking for is.

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
That's right.

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
And today, we went in looking for a specific type of book.

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,960
We wanted a book that had nursery rhymes.

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
All right.

73
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Nursery rhymes.

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,800
Now, these are kind of like songs or poems, things that we tell little children and babies.

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,360
So, Mary had a little lamb, little lamb.

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,080
That is a nursery rhyme.

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,360
It's a playful poem for children.

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
That's right.

79
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,680
So, obviously, since we are looking for nursery rhyme books, the librarian told us that we

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
need to go to the children's section.

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
That's right.

82
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,400
Now, before we get to borrow this book, there are a couple of things we need because the

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,680
person doesn't have a library card.

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Now, the question is, how do I get a library card?

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,160
What was the librarian's response, Marco?

86
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
Well, it was pretty simple.

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,600
All we needed was to see that person's driver's license or a utility bill.

88
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
All right.

89
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,740
So, a driver's license is an ID card, an identification card that you get that allows

90
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,480
you to drive a car.

91
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,840
Now, each state has a different kind of driver's license and different rules for how to get

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,560
one, but this is a very common, almost the most common kind of identification in America.

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
That's right.

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,640
So, basically, you show them your driver's license and it has a picture of you there,

95
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,160
your telephone number, and even your address.

96
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
That's right.

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,040
But not everybody has a driver's license.

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Some people don't drive.

99
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Some people can't drive.

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
Some people don't want to drive.

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
So, they would have to show something else.

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,400
And a good way to show that you live somewhere is to show your utility bill.

103
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
That's right.

104
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,280
So, a utility is basically water, electricity, gas, or your telephone bill, and it arrives

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,760
to your house and that's where it's, well, obviously, it says your address there and

106
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,800
who the bill is directed to.

107
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
So, you can prove that you live there.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
That's right.

109
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,320
Because why would somebody else pay for the water at that house?

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
It's obviously you.

111
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,880
So, these are a couple kinds of identification you can use to get a library card.

112
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
All right.

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,960
And while we're taking the books, we can borrow them for two weeks, but if we need to have

114
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,240
them for a longer period of time, we can take them back to the library and have them renewed.

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,120
So, to renew something, renew, means to continue to borrow it.

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
You have to re-borrow.

117
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,600
But we don't say re-borrow.

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
We say renew.

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,360
So, that means we get it for another two weeks.

120
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
That's right.

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,480
So, things that expire, usually you need to renew, like for example, your driver's license.

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,760
Usually it will last maybe five years, but then you need to renew your driver's license.

123
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,040
And if you don't renew it, if you forget to renew something, maybe there'll be a problem.

124
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,080
Like in the case of the library, you have to pay for the late fees.

125
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,760
Your book is overdue.

126
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
You have to pay for it.

127
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,920
Or in the case of a driver's license, if your driver's license is overdue, well, you probably

128
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,400
have to get a new one.

129
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
That's right.

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
Okay, so a lot of vocab there.

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Why don't we review everything and we'll be right back.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,160
Wow!

133
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Look at all these books!

134
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
I bet I can find a book about anything here!

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Shh!

136
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Please keep your voice down.

137
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,200
There are people reading and studying here.

138
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Okay, I'm sorry.

139
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
Are you the librarian?

140
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
Maybe you can help me.

141
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,120
I am looking for a book.

142
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,620
Yes, I am.

143
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,840
You can check our online catalog to search for the book you want based on the genre,

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,040
title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

145
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

146
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,060
That would be in our children's section.

147
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,960
That bookshelf there on the right.

148
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,440
Okay, I would like to check out these books.

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
Do you have a library card?

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,320
No, how do I get one?

151
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,600
I just need to see your driver's license or utility bill to prove that you are a resident

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
of this state.

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,560
Here you go.

154
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
So you're all set.

155
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
You can have these books for two weeks.

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,780
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

157
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,080
If you don't, you get charged 10 cents a day for each book.

158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
Okay, thanks.

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:08,800
Alright, so now we have three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Fluency Builder.

161
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,240
So Marco, what are librarians famous for?

162
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,160
Well, librarians are always telling you to please keep your voice down.

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,560
Alright, so libraries are quiet places.

164
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,440
They're places where people like to go and read and think and study.

165
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,040
So oftentimes when people are talking, they're being loud, the librarian will say, hey, keep

166
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,200
your voice down or be quiet.

167
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
That's right.

168
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,580
So another way of saying be quiet is keep your voice down.

169
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,240
And it's a little bit more polite.

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,600
Please keep your voice down.

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Keep your voice down.

172
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,040
Or if there's two people or three people, you'd say, keep your voices down.

173
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,720
So the librarian tells us to keep our voice down.

174
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
And well, now we can get some help from the librarian.

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,000
And he says that, you know, if you know the title of the book or the genre or the name

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,040
of the author, the librarian can point you towards the right direction.

177
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Now to point someone in the right direction or point someone towards the right direction

178
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,940
means to help them understand where to go.

179
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,840
Maybe they don't know exactly the title of the book or the author, but in this case,

180
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,960
the librarian can help put the person in the right place.

181
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,240
So I can point you in the right direction or point you towards the right direction.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Exactly.

183
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,840
Even maybe you're lost in a town and you stop and ask someone for directions because you

184
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,280
don't know how to get there.

185
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,840
And that person can help you by pointing you towards the right direction.

186
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
All right.

187
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,960
So this means I can help you basically.

188
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Okay.

189
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,120
And now what we wanted to do was we wanted to borrow books from the library.

190
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,560
We wanted to get books from the library.

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,120
But we have another way of saying this.

192
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,280
We can say we want to check out some books.

193
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
All right.

194
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,440
So to check out a book means to borrow it, like you say.

195
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,200
But this is also a noun.

196
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Check out.

197
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
That's the place where you scan something.

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,520
So maybe there's a bar, a black bar on the back of the book.

199
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,320
When you scan it, it scans out.

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,740
That means that you're borrowing it.

201
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,480
You get it for two weeks and you bring it back to check out.

202
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Okay.

203
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,880
So a lot of great stuff in this dialogue today, learning about libraries and how to get a

204
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
library card.

205
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,840
Why don't we review everything one last time?

206
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,040
Wow!

207
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,680
Look at all these books.

208
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,840
I bet I can find a book about anything here.

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Shh!

210
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,120
Please keep your voice down.

211
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,800
There are people reading and studying here.

212
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay.

213
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
Are you the librarian?

215
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,000
Maybe you can help me.

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
I am looking for a book.

217
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,320
Yes, I am.

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,520
You can check our online catalog to search for the book you want based on the genre,

219
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,760
title, or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.

220
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

221
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
That would be in our children's section.

222
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:11,040
That bookshelf there on the right.

223
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,160
Okay I would like to check out these books.

224
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,080
Do you have a library card?

225
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
No.

226
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
How do I get one?

227
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,320
I just need to see your driver's license or utility bill to prove that you are a resident

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
of this state.

229
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,280
Here you go.

230
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,560
So you're all set.

231
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,400
You can have these books for two weeks.

232
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,500
If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them.

233
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,640
If you don't, you get charged 10 cents a day for each book.

234
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Okay, thanks.

235
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,480
All right.

236
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,280
So borrowing books in a library seems pretty simple and you don't really have to leave

237
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,280
a deposit or something just in case you steal the book or you damage it.

238
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,320
How do you deal with this?

239
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,200
No, well libraries are a wonderful part of, well at least American culture.

240
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm not really sure how they work in other places, but in America there's a lot of federal

241
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,600
money in libraries.

242
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,960
In fact, I think it was Franklin Roosevelt who really helped get a library system in

243
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
place in America.

244
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,920
So they're a part of this system of kind of community sharing and information.

245
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,040
You can go to the library and look for jobs.

246
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,180
They have computers.

247
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,960
Many have DVD and video sections.

248
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,800
Many have very wonderful CD sections.

249
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,040
So basically it's a community center for information, knowledge.

250
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,600
And it's almost a relationship of trust.

251
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,320
I trust that the library will provide for me and the library will trust that I don't

252
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
destroy a book.

253
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
Of course, if you do, you have to pay.

254
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,240
You have to pay.

255
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,720
So is it a federal offense to steal a book from a library?

256
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,200
I don't know, but it's a pretty big deal to steal a book from the library.

257
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,360
They certainly will know who you are because they have your information, your driver's

258
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
license.

259
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Right.

260
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,800
It's actually pretty interesting, especially because, as you said, libraries, there's

261
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,600
a lot of money put into libraries.

262
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,480
So all communities have them, as you say, DVDs or movies or a lot of different types

263
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
of books.

264
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,080
And in other countries, like maybe in Latin America, it's not as popular to have a community

265
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,420
library where you can go and check things out because there's not that much money involved

266
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,240
as well.

267
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,200
But we would be curious to know how it works in your country.

268
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Maybe your country has some beautiful or extensive libraries.

269
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,840
Yeah, I'm very curious as well.

270
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,960
So public libraries, do you have them?

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,400
And if you don't, do you also have university libraries you can go to?

272
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Let us know.

273
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

274
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
All right, guys, we'll see you there.

275
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Bye.

276
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:58,440
Bye
