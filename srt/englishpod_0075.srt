00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,240
And today we're going to be going to one of the least favorite places of many, many people.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,440
So it must be the dentist.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Exactly.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,400
That place where you have to go every six months, but...

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,540
You probably don't go.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,540
You probably don't.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,600
I know I don't go every six months.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,580
So yeah, we're going to be going to the dentist and of course we're going to be looking at

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,520
a lot of great vocabulary related to teeth and all that crazy stuff dentists do.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Yes.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,860
And we'll also learn some really interesting phrases.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,040
So Marco, let's get started with our vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,480
Okay, in vocabulary preview today we have two words.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Let's take a look at the first one.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Toothache.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Toothache.

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Toothache.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Toothache.

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,680
Okay, so we've seen before this ending ache, right?

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Right.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
It means it hurts.

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Exactly.

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
So again, a toothache would be?

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
A hurting tooth.

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
A hurting tooth.

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Yes.

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
We can also say stomachache, headache.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Yep.

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Pretty much everything can...

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Ache.

35
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Ache.

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Yeah.

37
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Okay.

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
So our next word, x-ray.

39
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
X-ray.

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
X-ray.

41
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,960
X hyphen R-A-Y.

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,280
Okay, pretty easy word.

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,640
So when you go to the doctor, many times you'll get an x-ray.

44
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,560
It is a picture of your bones.

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Right.

46
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,800
So that's an x-ray.

47
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
All right.

48
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,280
Well, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,960
So why don't we listen as Gary visits his dentist?

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:54,760
Hey, Gary, great to see you again.

51
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,720
Please have a seat.

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,160
So tell me what seems to be the problem.

53
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,560
Thanks, doc.

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,320
I've got a really bad toothache.

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
I can't eat anything.

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,880
And look, my face is all swollen.

57
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,680
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

58
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,880
Well, let's have a look.

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Open wide.

60
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:29,880
This doesn't look good.

61
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,360
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose.

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,360
You'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse.

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,520
And the crown probably needs to be refitted.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm going to order some x-rays.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is it going to hurt?

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920
No, not at all.

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Just lay back and relax.

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Okay, spit.

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Okay, that always happens.

70
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,560
The dentist says, no, it's not going to hurt.

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Don't worry about it.

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
But it always hurts much more than he says.

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Exactly.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,480
So in this dialogue, we saw some interesting words when the dentist was describing what

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
problems Gary had.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
So why don't we look at those now in Language Takeaway.

78
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,080
All right, let's take a look at our first word.

80
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,440
So Gary said that his face was all swollen.

81
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Swollen.

82
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Swollen.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Swollen.

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,760
So swollen is an adjective, right Marco?

85
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Right.

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,560
So his face is or was swollen.

87
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
It was bigger.

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,920
Yeah, his face was bigger than normal.

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Yes.

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,400
Often when you hurt yourself, that part of your body becomes swollen.

91
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Swollen, right.

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,880
So you have to put some ice on it usually and then the swelling will go down.

93
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
And that's the noun, the swelling.

94
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,440
Right, the swelling.

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,480
And well, the verb to swell.

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,400
All right, three words for the price of one.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:28,880
So let's listen to some examples of how we would use the swelling, swollen and to swell.

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,400
Example one.

99
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,840
My nose is swollen.

100
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,000
It's the size of a football.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Example two.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,920
Put some ice on your foot and the swelling will go down.

103
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,200
Example three.

104
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I got bitten by a spider and my hand is swelling up.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,720
All right, so Gary's face was swollen and he thought that it was his wisdom teeth.

106
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,880
Wisdom teeth.

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Wisdom teeth.

108
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,440
Okay, so this is interesting.

109
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Wisdom is like wise.

110
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Yeah, knowledge.

111
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Knowledge.

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Yeah.

113
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,080
So these teeth, they're not knowledgeable, but they're called wisdom teeth.

114
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,480
They're the teeth that grow last in your mouth, right?

115
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,560
Right, they are the last teeth at the very end of your mouth.

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,440
Yes, and usually you get them when you're about 20.

117
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,000
And since they come out at this age, sometimes they interfere or they hurt a little bit,

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
so you have to get them taken out.

119
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Yes.

120
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,680
All right, wisdom teeth.

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Wisdom teeth.

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, now for our next word and something that we all got as children.

123
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Cavity.

124
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Cavity.

125
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
A cavity.

126
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
A cavity.

127
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
It's a hole in your tooth.

128
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
A hole in your tooth.

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,040
And it's caused by?

130
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Too much sugar.

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Too much sugar, right?

132
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,760
Or not brushing your teeth enough.

133
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Yeah.

134
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,440
So that's why everyone had it, I think, as children.

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Cavities.

136
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I never had a cavity.

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Really?

138
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Yeah.

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Wow, didn't have much sugar?

140
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,200
I guess I was a bit of a health nut when I was a kid.

141
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Well, no, I wasn't.

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
My mom was.

143
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,680
No, I guess not.

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,200
All right, but enough about my eating habits.

145
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,640
Let's talk about our next word, crown.

146
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Crown.

147
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,520
A crown.

148
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,240
So a crown, this is interesting.

149
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,120
We're not talking kings and queens.

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,320
That's the first thing that comes to mind, right?

151
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,800
No, a crown is actually the visible part of your teeth.

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Okay, so there's one part of your tooth that's inside that you can't see, right?

153
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
That's called the root.

154
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Yes.

155
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,220
So when he said your crown is loose, was he talking really about the actual tooth?

156
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,540
So sometimes people will lose a tooth or have a really bad cavity.

157
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,000
So the dentist needs to make a new crown or a new visible part of the tooth for you.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
So sometimes it'll be made of gold.

159
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Yep.

160
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Or porcelain.

161
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Porcelain, exactly.

162
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,760
So a crown, it's like a really, really, really big filling.

163
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,480
A crown.

164
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,360
So his crown needed to be refitted or put back into place.

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Yes.

166
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,280
Now our final word, filling.

167
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Filling.

168
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
A filling.

169
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
A filling.

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,200
So I just said this word previously.

171
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Now when you have a cavity, you need to fill it in.

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,960
Right, you need to fill it with something.

173
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Yes.

174
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
It's usually some sort of paste.

175
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,320
And it gets really hard, just like your tooth.

176
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Exactly.

177
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,080
So then it covers up this cavity.

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Filling.

179
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
A filling.

180
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I have many fillings.

181
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,480
I wasn't very healthy as a kid.

182
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
All right, not a good toothbrusher.

183
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Exactly.

184
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,400
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk a little

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,880
bit about some of the interesting phrases that the doctor used.

186
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,440
Hey, Gary.

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Great to see you again.

188
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
Please have a seat.

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,880
So tell me what seems to be the problem.

190
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,440
Thanks, Doc.

191
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
I've got a really bad toothache.

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I can't eat anything.

193
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,640
And look, my face is all swollen.

194
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,680
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

195
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,800
Well, let's have a look.

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Open wide.

197
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,240
This doesn't look good.

198
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,560
Well, it looks like you have a cavity, and your crown is loose.

199
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse.

200
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,640
And the crown probably needs to be refitted.

201
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm going to order some x-rays.

202
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Is it going to hurt?

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,120
No, not at all.

204
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,720
Just lay back and relax.

205
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Ah.

206
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Ah.

207
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Ah.

208
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Ah.

209
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Ah.

210
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Ah.

211
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Ah.

212
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Ah.

213
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Ah.

214
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Ah.

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Ah.

216
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Ah.

217
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
OK, spit.

218
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,080
Well, the dentist used three really interesting phrases, and I want to look at the first

219
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
one.

220
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,600
What seems to be the problem?

221
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,440
What seems to be the problem?

222
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,960
What seems to be the problem?

223
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
OK.

224
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,960
It's a very easy little sentence to ask somebody what's wrong.

225
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Exactly.

226
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Right?

227
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,600
And I mean, these are small, easy words, but when you put them together, they sound

228
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,060
really natural and really fluent.

229
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,160
So if you ask somebody what seems to be the problem, it's very polite, and it's a very

230
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
good way of asking what's wrong.

231
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Yes.

232
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
All right.

233
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,920
Our next phrase, also made up of simple words, let's have a look.

234
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,360
Let's have a look.

235
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,640
Let's have a look.

236
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,840
So this is a phrase that maybe your mechanic or your dentist or your doctor will say.

237
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Or anyone.

238
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Right.

239
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's have a look.

240
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,200
Let's look at it and see what the problem is.

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,440
OK.

242
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Let's have a look.

243
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
OK.

244
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,340
And our final phrase, it doesn't look good.

245
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,980
It doesn't look good.

246
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,760
It doesn't look good.

247
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
So I can use this phrase for an object, right?

248
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Yeah.

249
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
Like, this house doesn't look good.

250
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Yes.

251
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,540
But here it's used a little bit differently.

252
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,240
So why don't we listen to some examples to help us understand the meaning?

253
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,400
Example one.

254
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,080
John told me it doesn't look good for me.

255
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,360
I probably won't get the job.

256
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,120
Example two.

257
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,080
It doesn't look good for Michael Jackson.

258
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,440
He's in a lot of debt.

259
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,680
Example three.

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,960
No, the economy doesn't look very good.

261
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,640
OK.

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,000
So in the examples, we can see that they are using it for the situation.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

264
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,520
It looks maybe problematic.

265
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah.

266
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,720
So when you say it doesn't look good, you basically mean there are going to be problems.

267
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
All right.

268
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,440
It doesn't look good.

269
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Yeah.

270
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
OK.

271
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,640
So great phrases, great words.

272
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,400
Let's listen to our Gary at the dentist one more time.

273
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,040
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

274
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:16,400
Hey, Gary.

275
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,360
Great to see you again.

276
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,440
Please have a seat.

277
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
So tell me what seems to be the problem.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thanks, Doc.

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,040
I've got a really bad toothache.

280
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I can't eat anything.

281
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,600
And look, my face is all swollen.

282
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

283
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,600
Well, let's have a look.

284
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Open wide.

285
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,600
This doesn't look good.

286
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,080
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose.

287
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,120
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse.

288
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,280
And the crown probably needs to be refitted.

289
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,760
I'm going to order some x-rays.

290
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Is it going to hurt?

291
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,680
No, not at all.

292
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Just lay back and relax.

293
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Okay, spit.

294
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:49,600
Well, Marco, speaking of dentists, have you ever had an experience like this where you

295
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
spat out a tooth at the dentist?

296
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,360
Well, nothing so serious as this, but actually, recently when I was in Cambodia...

297
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,040
Oh, right, you called us in Cambodia.

298
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Yeah.

299
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,240
Well, our taxi driver offered us to have some local food.

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,320
And he said, well, we're going to have a dog.

301
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
So that was interesting.

302
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,080
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

303
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
It was pretty good.

304
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,680
But, you know, if you get around the fact that it's a dog...

305
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,200
So what does this have to do with your teeth?

306
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,280
I was eating it and I bit a bone that was hidden.

307
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,760
And I chipped my tooth.

308
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,200
So you broke part of your tooth.

309
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,440
Yeah, like half of it, which I had already chipped before.

310
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
So I had to go to the dentist.

311
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,280
And so the dentist created a new crown, not with gold or porcelain, actually with a paste.

312
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
And then it becomes hard and it just looks normal.

313
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,320
It doesn't even look like I have a fake crown, so to say.

314
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,620
But dentists can be really expensive.

315
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,000
So how much did this cost?

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,320
Well, this was for the bargain price of $10.

317
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
$10.

318
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
$10.

319
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,840
That's how much it cost.

320
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,120
So we should all go to Cambodia for dentistry.

321
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah, because actually it was pretty good.

322
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
He looked really young, though.

323
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,240
I was kind of scared because when he walked in, he looked like he was 19.

324
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,320
But I asked him his age and he was like 30.

325
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
OK, well, you're very trusting.

326
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Yeah.

327
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,800
So I imagine that you guys maybe have some dental experiences.

328
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,400
So why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it?

329
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Yeah, visit us at EnglishPod.com and you can find lots more resources for learning English

330
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
there.

331
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Well, guys, thanks for listening and until next time.

332
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Bye.

333
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Bye.
