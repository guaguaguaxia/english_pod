00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,200
My name is Katherine and today we're talking about something that I haven't actually seen

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,680
in a long time but is very common in the States, especially in suburban areas.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
That's right.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,720
We're going to get a subscription as the title of the lesson says.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,960
So we're going to subscribe to magazines, newspapers, stuff like that.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,240
So there's a guy coming around to everyone's houses and he's offering different magazine

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
subscriptions.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,080
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
what's going on.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Good afternoon, ma'am.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:47,080
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
No, thank you.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
I'm not interested.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,280
Please, ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
that could interest you.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,360
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,560
So if you'd excuse me.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,040
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,640
This one, for example, is a bi-monthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Wow.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,940
Well, that would be kind of useful.

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,440
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Sure do.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,800
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 colored pages of recipes

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,720
and also many home decorating ideas.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,520
Wow, this is nice.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,960
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,000
You mentioned you have a dog.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Can pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops,

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,320
and even pet sitters?

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,040
That's exactly what I needed.

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
What else do you have?

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Well, I also have...

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,240
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,600
So as you saw, Mike is, well, not very excited to be selling subscriptions, but he has magazines

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,480
about almost everything, I think.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
That's right.

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,720
And he's actually a pretty good salesperson because it sounds like this customer is going

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,400
to buy quite a few magazines.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Exactly.

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,800
And so he used a lot of interesting vocabulary related to magazines and subscriptions.

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,160
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,400
Okay, so this first word is one that we've already said a couple of times in today's

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
lesson.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,680
This is the topic of the lesson.

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,160
The word is subscription.

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,600
Okay, so if you get a subscription, that means that you are paying money to receive something

51
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,880
every month, every week, etc.

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
That's right.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
So the time is fixed.

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,360
Like you said, it could be weekly, the time could change.

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,880
But basically, you have a promise that after you pay this money, you'll receive something

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
periodically.

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Right.

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,320
And so there are many things that you could have a subscription for, not just magazines.

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,640
Newspapers come in subscriptions.

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
That's right.

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,480
Or maybe you pay for satellite TV.

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
That's a subscription.

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,920
You pay every month and you receive channels, like lots of channels.

64
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Exactly.

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,880
Or hopefully, EnglishPod, you receive by subscription or you pay the subscription fee.

66
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Exactly.

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,400
So with EnglishPod, you subscribe.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
That would be the verb.

69
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
A subscription is the noun.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,560
You subscribe to a service like a newspaper magazine and you receive the magazine or the

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,840
service every month, every week, every day, depending on what the subscription is like.

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,800
Okay, and so because subscriptions come at different time frames, so for example, EnglishPod,

73
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
we have lessons three times a week.

74
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,520
Newspapers are oftentimes every day.

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,200
They come in different periods of time.

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,280
So we call these kinds of publications periodicals.

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,440
Okay.

78
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,960
So for example, as you said, a newspaper, it comes every day.

79
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
That's the period of time.

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,280
So it's a periodical.

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,660
The same as a magazine.

82
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,440
Sometimes they are weekly.

83
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Sometimes they are monthly.

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,160
Is a book a periodical, Pop Quiz?

85
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
No.

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay.

87
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
No, because you only get it once.

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Right.

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,880
So basically, a periodical has to be something, I guess, that comes out every so often, a

90
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,440
new version, a new edition.

91
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,160
It's continually updating.

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,200
Okay.

93
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,440
So that is periodicals and subscriptions.

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,920
Now moving on to when he was trying to sell the magazines, he said, we have a great variety

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,320
of magazines all about cooking.

96
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,720
So what is a variety?

97
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Variety is a great word.

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
It's a word I personally am a very big fan of.

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,700
I like to have many choices to choose from.

100
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,440
So variety means something that has many options.

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,600
For example, at the grocery store, there's a great variety of food.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,280
There are apples and crackers and cakes and wine.

103
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,080
So variety means there are many different kinds of something.

104
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Okay.

105
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
So many choices.

106
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,240
At the bookstore, you can find a variety of books and magazines, for example.

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
All right.

108
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Now moving on to, again, when we're talking about the period of time, how often she's

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,840
going to get this cooking magazine, the one that he's showing her is a bi-monthly publication.

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,920
So what exactly does it mean if she receives a magazine bi-monthly?

111
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Okay.

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,960
So this is a bit confusing in English.

113
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,760
Bi-monthly has two meanings, but what's important is the word bi- here or the prefix bi-.

114
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
That means two.

115
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Okay.

116
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Okay.

117
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,360
So we could say bi-monthly, bi-weekly, bi-annually.

118
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,640
These all mean two.

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,680
So in this case, we're talking about something that I receive two times every month.

120
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Okay.

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,440
Or it can be that you get it once every two months.

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Okay.

123
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
So that might be confusing.

124
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Right.

125
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,560
So let's just say that it's the month of October and I have this great subscription to a magazine.

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,400
So in October, I will receive it two times.

127
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Exactly.

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
So you get it twice.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Or it could also mean that you receive the magazine in October and then you don't receive

130
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,280
another magazine until December.

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,640
So it's a bi-monthly publication.

132
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,240
Every other month.

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Every two months.

134
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Right.

135
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
So this is very confusing for us.

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,400
It's confusing for you, but if you see this word bi-monthly or bi-weekly, you should ask

137
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,360
the person who's offering the subscription what kind they mean.

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,120
Is it every month two times or is it every other month?

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
All right.

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,200
So exactly.

141
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,280
Just remember the prefix bi- means two.

142
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,120
And then if it's bi-monthly, bi-annual, bi-weekly, you have to more or less make sure that they

143
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,840
specify what they mean because it can mean both.

144
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,640
And that's how ambiguous this word is.

145
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
It is.

146
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,520
So the next one, the next word we have for you is not nearly as confusing.

147
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,600
It's a very, very common word in both periodicals and sales, but also in marketing and business

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
as well.

149
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Right.

150
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,440
We're talking about a quarterly publication or something that comes out once every quarter.

151
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Right.

152
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
So if you think about a year, a year has 12 months.

153
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,040
A quarter of a year is three months.

154
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040
So the first quarter is January, February, March.

155
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Exactly.

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,680
So a quarterly publication means that you will get a magazine four times in one year.

157
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Okay.

158
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,760
We could also talk about quarterly sales.

159
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,760
You know, this quarter our business did very well, but last quarter was not so good.

160
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,480
So quarter means three months at a time.

161
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Exactly.

162
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,800
And for our last word on language takeaway today, we are talking about a weekly newsletter.

163
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
So weekly is pretty straightforward.

164
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
You receive it once every week.

165
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
That's right.

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,700
So weekly publications are very common.

167
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
What is a newsletter?

168
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,120
A newsletter is important in periodicals because it's not a magazine, but it's not a letter

169
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
either.

170
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,000
It's basically a short update, a couple of pages maybe, or even one page that's on a

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,880
piece of paper that gives you information about a group or a club or a community.

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,440
For example, we could say the EnglishPod newsletter comes out quarterly.

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Exactly.

174
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,680
Maybe in your offices you receive your company's newsletter.

175
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,760
So usually some companies will come out with a monthly or a quarterly newsletter where

176
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,600
if you have many offices or many branches all over the country or the world, then you

177
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,040
will receive updates or news about what's going on in other places within your same

178
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
company.

179
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
That's right.

180
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,800
So these are very useful for communication across the company.

181
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,240
You can tell some people in your New York office that in Los Angeles we have a new cafeteria

182
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
or a new employee.

183
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Exactly.

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,520
So that is what a newsletter is basically for.

185
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
I think it's time now for us to listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to talk

186
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:45,160
to you with four key phrases on Fluency Builder right after this.

187
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Good afternoon ma'am.

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,120
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

189
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
No, thank you.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm not interested.

191
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,720
Please ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,880
that could interest you.

193
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,520
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking, so if you'd excuse me.

194
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,640
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

195
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,640
This one for example is a bi-monthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

196
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Wow, well that would be kind of useful.

197
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,840
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

198
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Sure do.

199
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,500
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 colored pages of recipes

200
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,520
and also many home decorating ideas.

201
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Wow, this is nice.

202
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,640
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

203
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,000
You mentioned you have a dog.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,920
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops

205
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,600
and even pet sitters.

206
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,320
That's exactly what I needed.

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
What else do you have?

208
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Well, I also have...

209
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:48,680
All right, so now we have some sentences or ways that you can say things on Fluency Builder.

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Fluency Builder.

211
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Okay, this first phrase is very, very common among sales and sales people because basically

212
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,440
it's a way to be polite and to ask someone to listen to you for a little while.

213
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
The salesperson says, if you could spare five minutes of your time.

214
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
Okay, so let's start with that part.

215
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
If you could spare.

216
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,960
So to spare something means do you have something extra?

217
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,160
Do you have enough of it?

218
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,440
Yeah, so I could say, can you spare $5?

219
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,040
I forgot my wallet at home.

220
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,680
So that means do you have an extra $5 I could borrow?

221
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, very good.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,880
So if you're asking someone to spare five minutes of their time, you're asking them

223
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,680
to give you five minutes of their time.

224
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
That's right.

225
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,400
So if you could spare a second or if you could spare five minutes of your time, I would like

226
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
to talk to you.

227
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,680
Okay, so it's a very polite way to ask someone for their time.

228
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,200
Now for our next phrase, the woman is also very polite.

229
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
She says, you know what?

230
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I have to walk the dog.

231
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,760
I have to finish cooking.

232
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,120
So if you would excuse me.

233
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,600
She's basically saying no in a very polite way.

234
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,200
If you could excuse me, I've got to go.

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:06,880
So this is a kind of a very indirect but polite way of saying, I'm sorry, I can't stay.

236
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,720
I got to go or I can't really talk to you right now.

237
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
That's right.

238
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,600
So if you're at a party, for example, and you're talking to somebody, but you don't

239
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,280
really want to talk to them anymore, you could say, it was nice talking to you if you could

240
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
excuse me.

241
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,480
It means if I can leave now.

242
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay, so you can say if you could excuse me or if you would excuse me.

243
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,760
Both forms are pretty much the same.

244
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,400
Okay, and what about when she actually is convinced about the magazine?

245
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
She says, wow, this is nice.

246
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,320
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

247
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,360
Okay, sign me up.

248
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,280
This means I would like a subscription.

249
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,360
That means I would like you to take my information and I will give you some money.

250
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,160
But this is also a really nice phrase in English because it means I want to do this.

251
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm interested.

252
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,560
So if you would use this in another context, for example, a group of friends are going

253
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
to the movies.

254
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,440
I say, oh, sign me up.

255
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I want to go.

256
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
I heard that movie was awesome.

257
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Okay, very good.

258
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,400
So sign me up is like include me, I want to go to or I'm part of it, of whatever you're

259
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
doing.

260
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Exactly.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,280
Okay, so that's all the phrases we have for you today.

262
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,960
I think they're really good.

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,040
They're not specific for this circumstance of getting a subscription.

264
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,760
As we saw, we can use them in many other situations.

265
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,280
So I think we should go back, listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back

266
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:39,480
to talk a little bit more.

267
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Good afternoon, ma'am.

268
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,480
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

269
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
No, thank you.

270
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm not interested.

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,960
Please, ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something

272
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
that could interest you.

273
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,040
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking.

274
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
So if you'd excuse me.

275
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,720
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

276
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,400
This one, for example, is a bi-monthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

277
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Wow.

278
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,640
Well, that would be kind of useful.

279
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,200
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

280
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Sure do.

281
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,480
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 colored pages of recipes

282
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,360
and also many home decorating ideas.

283
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,240
Wow, this is nice.

284
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,320
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

285
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
You mentioned you have a dog.

286
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops

287
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
and even pet sitters.

288
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,760
That's exactly what I needed.

289
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
What else do you have?

290
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Well, I also have...

291
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:40,560
All right, so subscriptions, periodicals, all this is very common, as you said, in the

292
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
United States.

293
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,640
People get them through the mail every month, right?

294
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
That's right.

295
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,760
And I have to say, it's changing now.

296
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,160
You know, we used to get subscriptions at home when I was a kid.

297
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,640
We'd have magazine subscriptions and even a newspaper subscription.

298
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,040
But these days, people are doing more and more on the internet.

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,820
So you don't see the guy with the subscriptions coming from, you know, going from door to

300
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,440
door to sell you this.

301
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
You do it yourself on the internet.

302
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,960
So it's pretty common that way.

303
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Do you have any web subscriptions?

304
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,320
No, no, no.

305
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,400
I haven't signed up for any periodicals on the web.

306
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,200
I do receive the newspaper every day and that's about it.

307
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,680
It's kind of hard to receive magazines where we are, but I am a big fan of magazines like

308
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,360
National Geographic or Popular Mechanics.

309
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
I had that when I was a kid.

310
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,440
My grandmother would always give us a subscription to National Geographic for Christmas.

311
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,800
It's a very good magazine and it's so colorful, full of pictures and really interesting articles,

312
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,900
not only about animals, but about the world in general.

313
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
So it's really cool.

314
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
That's right.

315
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,080
And they always gave you a map that you could take out and open up and it was the best part

316
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
of the whole magazine.

317
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Exactly.

318
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,480
So actually, I really enjoy having subscriptions to periodicals, magazines, newspapers.

319
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,560
Not a big fan of newsletters or things on the internet.

320
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,960
I kind of like to hold a magazine or take it with me if I'm on a trip.

321
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,520
Yeah, I totally agree.

322
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,280
So yeah, but I think many of our listeners may have a subscription to their local newspaper,

323
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,120
local magazines, or maybe as you said, internet subscriptions.

324
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,480
I know some people sign up for the Harvard Business Review that's available online or

325
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,320
even I think the New York Times has an online platform.

326
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
They do.

327
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
They do.

328
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,200
So you should let us know what subscriptions do you have, what periodicals do you like

329
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
to read.

330
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Our website of course is EnglishPod.com.

331
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,960
You can also purchase a subscription there.

332
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,000
We hope to see you on the website and until next time.

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
All right.

334
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:48,240
Bye.
