00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,880
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,880
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,880
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,360
And today we're swimming.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
That's right.

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,640
A nice summertime lesson for everyone.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,200
A summertime lesson.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,520
So we're going to be talking about swimming and, well, it's a very popular sport, right?

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Yeah.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,440
So this is another lesson in our sports series.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,840
In our sports series.

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Okay.

14
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,400
So why don't we preview some of the language we'll find in the dialogue.

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Ready preview.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
All right.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,560
We have two words to look at here.

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,160
The first word is sailing.

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Sailing.

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
Sailing.

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Sailing.

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,120
Well, this is the verb to sail, right?

23
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,100
So sailing is traveling in a boat.

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,320
In a boat with no engine.

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Right.

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,600
So you must use the wind to push you forward.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Exactly.

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
That's a sailboat.

29
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Yes.

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Okay.

31
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
So sailing.

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Now let's take a look at our other word.

33
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Anchor.

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Anchor.

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Another boat word here.

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Anchor.

37
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Anchor.

38
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Anchor.

39
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Now, it's spelled A-N-C-H-O-R.

40
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,120
Right.

41
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,240
But you don't pronounce the C-H as you normally would, right?

42
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,880
Another one of these really difficult to spell English words.

43
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Right.

44
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,320
So you don't say anchor, you would say anchor.

45
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
Anchor.

46
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Anchor.

47
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Anchor.

48
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
So the anchor is a verb and a noun.

49
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
That's right.

50
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,000
So when anchor is used as a noun, it means the hook that you throw over the boat into

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,080
the water and it keeps you staying in the same place.

52
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Okay.

53
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,560
But the verb to anchor.

54
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
Yes.

55
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
What does it mean?

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
To do that.

57
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
To do that, right?

58
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,320
So to throw the anchor into the water, you would just say to anchor the boat.

59
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Exactly.

60
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,040
To keep it in the same place.

61
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Okay.

62
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,960
Great words related to sailing.

63
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
But now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

64
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
What's happening here, Erika?

65
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,680
We've got two friends here who are sailing in their boat and they decide to take a swim.

66
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:11,080
Let's see what happens.

67
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,640
This is such a beautiful day.

68
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,920
Great day for sailing.

69
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,080
It sure is.

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,240
The water looks so nice.

71
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,740
Anchor the boat for a little while.

72
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm going to take a dip.

73
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,080
Why are you doggy paddling?

74
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,600
I taught you how to swim.

75
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,400
Do your breast stroke.

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
I get too tired.

77
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I'll just backstroke.

78
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
It's easier.

79
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,960
Try kicking your legs more.

80
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
That's good.

81
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,640
Don't go out too far.

82
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,400
It's fine.

83
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Jump in.

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
Kathy, get back here.

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I see a shark.

86
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Help me.

87
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Help.

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Bring the boat closer.

89
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
The shark is coming straight towards me.

90
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
It's right under you.

91
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Kathy.

92
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:04,440
All right.

93
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,680
So a shark attack.

94
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I know.

95
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,800
This is my worst fear when swimming.

96
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,440
Really in the ocean, right?

97
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Yeah.

98
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,480
Well, also in the lake, but...

99
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
No sharks in lakes.

100
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
I know, but I'm still afraid of them.

101
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
All right, so don't worry about it.

102
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,560
I'm sure the girl is okay.

103
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,600
It's probably not a shark.

104
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Maybe it was a dolphin.

105
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah, or maybe she's going to punch the shark in the face and she'll escape.

106
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Okay.

107
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Let's take a look at some of the words that we saw in Language Takeaway.

108
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,200
Language Takeaway.

109
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,360
We have three excellent swimming words for you.

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,320
The first one is doggy paddling.

111
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,400
Doggy paddling.

112
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,480
Doggy paddling.

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,240
So doggy paddling.

114
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,440
It's not really a proper way of swimming, right?

115
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,080
No, you don't see this in the Olympics.

116
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,040
So if you've ever seen a dog swim, that's why they call it doggy paddling.

117
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Right.

118
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,920
You're sort of moving your hands quickly in front of you.

119
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
And your legs are all over the place.

120
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Yeah.

121
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,480
And you're basically not really swimming.

122
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,160
You're just trying to stay afloat.

123
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,520
You're trying not to drown.

124
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Trying not to sink.

125
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Yeah.

126
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah.

127
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Okay.

128
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
So doggy paddling.

129
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Again, this can be a noun or a verb.

130
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,800
It's either doggy paddle, this swimming style, or doggy paddling, the verb.

131
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Okay.

132
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Interesting.

133
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
All right.

134
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's take a look at our second swimming style.

135
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Breaststroke.

136
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Breaststroke.

137
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Breaststroke.

138
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
The breaststroke.

139
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
How is this one?

140
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Well, it's sort of like swimming like a frog.

141
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,600
So you have your legs that are similar to like a frog, right?

142
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Yeah.

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
And what are your hands doing?

144
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Your hands are moving in front of you together, then out towards the side.

145
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Okay.

146
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,640
So you're kind of doing like circles.

147
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Yeah.

148
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Half circles.

149
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Half circles.

150
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Okay.

151
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Breaststroke.

152
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Yeah.

153
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
But you get kind of tired when you swim like this, right?

154
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Yeah, maybe.

155
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Yeah.

156
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Yeah.

157
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,240
Now, let's take a look at our third word.

158
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Backstroke.

159
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Backstroke.

160
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Backstroke.

161
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Backstroke.

162
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,480
So this one is pretty easy.

163
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
Backstroke, you are?

164
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Lying on your back.

165
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Lying on your back.

166
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
In the water.

167
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Mm-hmm.

168
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
And you're kicking your feet as well.

169
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Yep.

170
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
But what are your hands doing?

171
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
They're going back behind you.

172
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
See, I'm doing it now.

173
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Can you see?

174
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
All right.

175
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,440
If you guys could be here in the studio, you would see Erika doing her backstroke.

176
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Yeah.

177
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm pretty good at it.

178
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Yeah.

179
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Okay.

180
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,840
So let's listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll come back and look at some great

181
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,280
phrases.

182
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,920
This is such a beautiful day.

183
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Great day for sailing.

184
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
It sure is.

185
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
The water looks so nice.

186
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Anchor the boat for a little while.

187
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,160
I'm going to take a dip.

188
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
Why are you doggy paddling?

189
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,760
I taught you how to swim.

190
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Do your breaststroke.

191
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
I get too tired.

192
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll just backstroke.

193
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,080
It's easier.

194
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
Try kicking your legs more.

195
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
That's good.

196
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
Don't go out too far.

197
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
It's fine.

198
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Jump in.

199
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,120
Kathy, get back here.

200
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I see a shark.

201
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Help me!

202
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Help!

203
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Bring the boat closer.

204
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,400
The shark is coming straight towards me.

205
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,680
It's right under you.

206
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Kathy!

207
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,840
Okay, so we have some really good phrases related to swimming and water.

208
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Yeah.

209
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,720
Okay, let's take a look at these in Fluency Builder.

210
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Fluency Builder.

211
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
All right, the first one.

212
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,200
I love this phrase.

213
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,640
Take a dip.

214
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Take a dip.

215
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Take a dip.

216
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,080
So if I say, I'm going to take a dip.

217
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,960
You're going to have a quick swim.

218
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
A quick swim.

219
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Yep.

220
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
So you can take a dip in the pool.

221
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Yep.

222
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
In the lake.

223
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
In the ocean.

224
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
In the ocean.

225
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Even in your bathtub, right?

226
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
No.

227
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
No?

228
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
No, it's just for swimming.

229
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,120
Unless your bathtub is really, really, really big.

230
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,920
All right, so not for the bathtub, but for swimming.

231
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Yep.

232
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Okay.

233
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,280
Now, let's take a look at our second phrase.

234
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,440
For a little while.

235
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,840
For a little while.

236
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
For a little while.

237
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,200
For a little while.

238
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
This is really common.

239
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I use this a lot.

240
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Yeah, me too.

241
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,160
I probably use it 500 times a day.

242
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay, so let's listen to some examples with for a little while, and then we'll come back

243
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,120
and explain it.

244
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Example one.

245
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm tired.

246
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,060
I'm just going to sit down for a little while.

247
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,100
Example two.

248
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,360
It will only hurt for a little while.

249
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Example three.

250
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,840
Do you want to play tennis for a little while?

251
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,800
So it means for a short time.

252
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
For a short time.

253
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
And you can change it, right?

254
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,640
You can say, oh, I'm going to play for a little while.

255
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,880
Yeah, or I'm going to sleep for a little while.

256
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
For a short time.

257
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Yep.

258
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,440
All right, so if learners use this phrase, I find it sounds really, really great because

259
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,320
it's not something that students normally use.

260
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,400
Yeah, I guess a student wouldn't really use this phrase normally.

261
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,040
Yeah, so guys, use it because you'll sound awesome.

262
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah, you'll sound really, really fluent.

263
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,960
Okay, and let's take a look at our last phrase.

264
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,400
Straight towards.

265
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Straight towards.

266
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,960
Straight towards me.

267
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Straight towards.

268
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,480
Okay, so straight means directly.

269
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Right, in a line.

270
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,200
In a line, not going anywhere else, but directly.

271
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Not moving side to side.

272
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
And towards is in that direction.

273
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,280
So the shark was coming straight towards me, it's coming directly at me.

274
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,240
Moving in a line and not moving side to side.

275
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, so can you give me another example of how you would use straight towards?

276
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Watch out!

277
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
The shark is coming straight towards you.

278
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,400
Okay, directly towards you.

279
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,120
Yeah, or maybe when I get home from work, I go straight towards the fridge.

280
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Really?

281
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes.

282
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
I believe this.

283
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
All right, so straight towards, directly.

284
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,280
Okay, so we've looked at a lot of great words, really good phrases.

285
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,040
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and Erica is going

286
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:22,280
to tell us a really great story about boat.

287
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
This is such a beautiful day.

288
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
Great day for sailing.

289
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,280
It sure is.

290
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
The water looks so nice.

291
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Anchor the boat for a little while.

292
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm going to take a dip.

293
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,280
Why are you doggy paddling?

294
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,800
I taught you how to swim.

295
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Do your breaststroke.

296
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
I get too tired.

297
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll just backstroke.

298
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's easier.

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,160
Try kicking your legs more.

300
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
That's good.

301
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,840
Don't go out too far.

302
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,600
It's fine.

303
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Jump in.

304
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Cathy, get back here.

305
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I see a shark.

306
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Help me!

307
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Help!

308
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Bring the boat closer.

309
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
The shark is coming straight towards me.

310
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
It's right under you.

311
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Cathy!

312
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:21,080
All right, well, Marco, I was telling you that I used to spend every summer on the lake

313
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:28,640
and my family had a really small house on a small island and my cousins had another

314
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
small house on another small island.

315
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,240
So our families are really close and we used to go to one house for dinner one night and

316
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,160
the other house to dinner the next night.

317
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,840
So everyone was over at my cousin's house except for my grandfather.

318
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,940
And so he was thinking, okay, it's late, maybe I better go pick up my wife and see what's

319
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,000
going on.

320
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,160
So he goes into the boat.

321
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
It's dark.

322
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Okay.

323
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,660
There's no light on the boat.

324
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:06,360
He's driving straight towards the island when suddenly my cousin in his boat drives directly

325
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
into my grandfather.

326
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
So they crashed.

327
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
They crashed.

328
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
Two boats crashed in the lake.

329
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,000
And then my grandfather's boat flipped over.

330
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,320
It turned upside down.

331
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,280
And he fell in the water.

332
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
But he was okay, right?

333
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Yeah, he was okay.

334
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,360
But you know what?

335
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,080
He was really angry about this.

336
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
And the boat?

337
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,560
The boat stayed in the water and the engine fell down to the bottom.

338
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,120
So we had to go the next morning to get the boat.

339
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,080
And we actually had to hire some scuba divers to go to the bottom of the lake to get the

340
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
engine.

341
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Wow.

342
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Yeah.

343
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,560
I imagine your grandpa was pretty angry.

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Yeah.

345
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
He tells the story.

346
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Every year.

347
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Yeah, exactly.

348
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
But you know what?

349
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,400
I've got a million of these crazy lake stories because my family.

350
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
It always happens.

351
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Yeah.

352
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
All right, guys.

353
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,080
Well, do you have any crazy stories or any stories related to boats or to swimming?

354
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Or to shark attacks?

355
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Or shark attacks?

356
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah.

357
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,280
