00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,020
My name is Kathryn and today we're talking about a very, very important part of conversations

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,020
in English.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,020
That's right.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,200
Today we are introducing a new series all about small talk.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
Okay, what is small talk, Marco?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,560
Well, small talk is just everyday conversation about maybe the weather, about how you are,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,760
what's new in your life, etc. just plain conversation.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,040
So something very simple and usually pretty quick.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,440
It's what you say to people when you bump into them or when you see them at a party.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,400
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out just what kind of small talk

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,160
we have.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,400
Hey Michelle, this is my friend James.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,200
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,080
Oh, hi James.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,520
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,200
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, actually a little of both.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,240
I'm meeting some business contacts but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Oh, that's cool.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
How's it going?

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,560
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
But I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
It's really an amazing city.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
It sure is.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,560
Are you staying for long?

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,280
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,000
I wish I could stay longer but...

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,160
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sites, then just call me.

31
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,240
I'm having a little get-together at my new apartment next week.

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
So if you want to drop by then...

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
That sounds great.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'd love to.

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,840
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,480
So now let's take a look at a lot of great phrases that we've picked out for you this

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,120
time on Fluency Builder.

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Fluency Builder.

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
All right.

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,880
So we've got two Fluency Builders today.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,960
So we're going to be exploring a lot of different phrases.

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,220
We've got three now.

44
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,760
The first one is very, very common.

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,120
You hear this phrase, nice to meet you.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Right.

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,160
So obviously if you meet someone new, you're introduced by your friend or something, you

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,480
can just say, hi, nice to meet you.

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
All right.

50
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,280
So, nice to meet you.

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Nice to meet you too.

52
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,880
That's what we say afterwards because it sounds very funny if you say it two times.

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,560
So, hi, it's nice to meet you.

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
Right, exactly.

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,160
So she went on, this girl, Michelle, to ask if he is visiting Shanghai for business or

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
pleasure.

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
All right.

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,720
This is an important difference, something that we often talk about in Small Talk.

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,200
You can travel for business.

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,520
That means business trips.

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,820
Or you can travel to see different sites and have fun.

63
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,820
That's called pleasure.

64
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,680
And so we often hear this phrase, business or pleasure.

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Right.

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,680
So if someone comes to your country, you say, oh, so are you here for business or pleasure?

67
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Oh, I'm here on business or I'm here to see the sites.

68
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Okay, very good.

69
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,280
And so, James is actually in Shanghai doing both things.

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,320
He's on a business trip, but he's also taking Mandarin classes.

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,560
And so Michelle went on to say, that's great.

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
How's it going?

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
All right.

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,520
You're going to hear this all the time in English.

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,280
We say, how's it going to our friends and family?

76
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,560
I wouldn't say it in a formal occasion with my boss or with my teacher, but it's very

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,680
casual, very informal.

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,520
And it's a way to ask how things are.

79
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
So you're taking classes.

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
How's it going?

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,960
Exactly.

82
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,000
So this basically means how are the classes going?

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How is everything?

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,740
Or you could say, oh, Marco, I haven't seen you in a while.

86
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,740
How is it going?

87
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,640
And that's another way of saying hi to someone or saying, how are you?

88
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
How are you?

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,160
How have you been recently?

90
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,080
So there are two differences in that phrase there.

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,960
In this case, Michelle is asking how the Mandarin classes are going.

92
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
How is it?

93
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Is it good?

94
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Is it bad?

95
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Is it difficult?

96
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Is it easy?

97
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Etc.

98
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,040
But if you say to someone, hi, I haven't seen you for such a long time.

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
How's it going?

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,080
That's more of a how are you type thing.

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
That's like how's your life going?

102
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Exactly.

103
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
So just think about what you're talking about.

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you talking about general situations like a person's life?

105
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,120
Or are you talking about maybe lessons or class or job?

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
That's right.

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
Okay, so we're going to take a break here.

108
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,080
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit with more phrases.

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,160
Hey Michelle, this is my friend James.

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
Oh, hi James.

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,240
Nice to meet you.

113
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,080
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

114
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,720
Well, actually a little of both.

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,960
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Oh, that's cool.

117
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
How's it going?

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
It's really an amazing city.

120
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
It sure is.

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
Are you staying for long?

122
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,000
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
I wish I could stay longer, but...

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,880
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sites, then just call me.

125
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,940
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week.

126
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,800
So if you want to drop by then...

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
That sounds great.

128
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I'd love to.

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

130
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,960
All right, we're back.

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder Part Two.

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,040
So Michelle, at the end of today's dialogue says, if you need someone to show you the

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,960
sites, then just call me.

134
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
All right.

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,120
So to show someone the sites, we talked about this a little bit earlier with that word pleasure.

136
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
What does it mean to show someone the sites, Marco?

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,360
So basically, the sites, we're talking about the different attractions of a city or place.

138
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,840
So the museums, maybe different buildings or different attractions in general.

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,280
What is there to sightsee?

140
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,640
Okay, so we are in Paris, Marco, and I say, hey, I'd love to show you the sites.

141
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
What do you expect to see?

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,680
So maybe we would go to the Eiffel Tower.

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Maybe we would go to...

144
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Notre Dame Cathedral.

145
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Exactly.

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,400
And we would go see all these different sites and that would mean that you are showing me

147
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
the sites.

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,000
You are taking me to see all these sites.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,920
And she is also having a little get together at her apartment, at her new apartment.

150
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,480
So what is a little get together?

151
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
This is a noun.

152
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,040
This is a get together.

153
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
So think about this.

154
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,320
Two different words actually, get together, but it's a noun, it's a thing.

155
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,120
It's like a party, but it's a small party.

156
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Right.

157
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
A little get together.

158
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,240
So I just, I like to think of a get together as something very casual, something very small,

159
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,160
sometimes intimate, where you just have three or four or five friends.

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,360
And it's, yeah, it's not as big as a party where everyone's dancing.

161
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Okay.

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
So a little get together is just a small group of people, you invite them over to your house,

163
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,600
very relaxed, very casual.

164
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
It's not really a party.

165
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,200
It's more of a reunion of friends.

166
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
And like we said, it's a noun.

167
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,720
So you say, I'm having a get together, you should come.

168
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Okay.

169
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,800
And she actually asks them to come, but she says it in a different way.

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,640
She says, if you want to drop by.

171
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Okay.

172
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,320
This is something people often say in small talk, because you don't want to say, you should

173
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,880
come stay for a while because that's, I don't know, they just met.

174
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
It's not in order.

175
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Yeah.

176
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,720
So you should drop by means you should come and see and decide if you want to stay.

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,720
So basically it's also kind of a relaxed way of saying you can come whenever you want during

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
the, during our party or our get together.

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,560
So if the get together is 9pm to midnight, you can drop by whenever, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.

180
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,800
So to drop by is to come for a short period.

181
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,640
So if we're talking on the phone and I say, I'll drop by your house later on today, that

182
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,480
means I'm going to go to your house very quickly at an unexpected time.

183
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Yeah.

184
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Or you could use it in a question, you know, Marco, I really wanted to borrow that DVD.

185
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,880
When can I drop by to pick it up?

186
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Okay.

187
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Very, very good.

188
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,240
So let's take a look at our last phrase.

189
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,600
Michelle and James decided that they want to keep in touch and so he said, let me take

190
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
down your number.

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,040
So we're not talking about taking it anywhere, taking a number anywhere and going somewhere.

193
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,920
We're talking about writing something down.

194
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,280
So in this case, your number is your phone number.

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Okay.

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,360
Let me take down your number means let me write down your telephone number.

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Uh huh.

198
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Okay.

199
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,240
So it's another way of saying, let me write down your telephone number.

200
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,320
Take down my phone number.

201
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Call me later.

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
That's right.

203
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,560
So can I take down your number so I can call you later?

204
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Okay.

205
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,320
That's another way of asking this question.

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Very good.

207
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
All right.

208
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
So that concludes Fluency Builder.

209
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,960
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

210
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,680
Hey Michelle, this is my friend James.

211
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,520
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

212
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,360
Oh, hi James.

213
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,800
Nice to meet you.

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,080
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

215
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,280
Well actually a little of both.

216
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

217
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,720
Oh, that's cool.

218
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
How's it going?

219
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,580
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

220
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,160
It's really an amazing city.

221
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,240
It sure is.

222
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,860
Are you staying for long?

223
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,560
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

224
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
I wish I could stay longer, but...

225
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,480
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sites, then just call me.

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week.

227
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,320
So if you want to drop by then.

228
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
That sounds great.

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I'd love to.

230
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

231
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,400
Okay, so this is part one of our small talk series.

232
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,880
We're going to have 10 episodes and in each episode we're going to be faced with a little

233
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,480
different situation or circumstance where we will be forced to have a very quick chat

234
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
with someone.

235
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
That's right.

236
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,760
And you're often going to find yourself in these situations if you're traveling to an

237
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,160
English speaking country or you're living or working in America, for example.

238
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,160
And so it's really important because I think oftentimes you don't learn this in class.

239
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,960
This is something that you have to really learn when you're in the country or learn

240
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
with us here at EnglishPod.

241
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
That's right.

242
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,160
It's a little bit of social skills for these awkward or maybe new situations.

243
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Exactly.

244
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
All right.

245
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,240
So if you guys have any other questions or doubts, you can find us at EnglishPod.com

246
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
and we'll see everyone there.

247
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Bye guys.

248
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Bye.

249
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Bye.
