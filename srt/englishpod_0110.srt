00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,340
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,080
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,520
And today we have a lesson for all our university students out there.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
That's right.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,640
We're talking about registering for university.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,940
Okay, so it's a difficult process sometimes even in your own language, so we're going

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,540
to try and make it a little bit easier by giving you some of the common words you would

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,280
need to register at a university.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,840
Alright, well I think it's time we get started by listening to the dialogue.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:53,960
And we're going to listen to a young female student as she tries to choose her classes.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,920
Excuse me, is this where I register?

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,360
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,840
Yes, of course.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,520
I need your student ID please.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Here you are.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
Okay, Susan.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,880
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,480
Is this information correct?

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Yes.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,320
I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,880
Sure, that's not a problem.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
Yeah, here's my list.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,140
Yeah, that's perfect.

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,720
What about the subjects for your minor?

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,920
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,600
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,880
Okay, here you go.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
You're registered now.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,920
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,400
All right, great, a very good student taking a lot of classes this semester.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,040
I know, and it sounds like some of them are pretty hard as well.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, they are.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, she used some of those very common phrases that we would need when we are registering

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
at university.

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,400
So let's take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay.

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,440
So, the first thing, I think we need to deal with this word to register.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,200
Register.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,960
So register for university.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,080
Okay, so we've mentioned this word many times, so I think it would be a good idea to listen

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,100
to some examples and then we'll come back and explain it.

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,520
Example one.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,920
I registered to attend the conference on international trade this month.

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,680
Example two.

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,600
It is your obligation as a good citizen to register to vote.

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,560
Example three.

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,720
It is necessary to register on our website before joining the conference.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,120
So when you register for something, you put your name down on a list, right?

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,040
So in this case, when you register for university, you officially put your name on the list of

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,920
students in that course.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,400
Okay, so you can register for university.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,080
What else can you register for?

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Register for a class.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,280
You can even register to vote.

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Okay, so register.

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,280
Now she was registering for her classes and we saw these words that we know already, but

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,040
it's a good idea to take a look at them.

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
We heard that she is a business major.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
So a major.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
A major.

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
A business major.

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400
A business major.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,440
And what is your major?

69
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,640
The major is the major area that you study, the most important area that you study.

70
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
The area where you are specialized.

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,440
Yeah, the area that you focus on.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,200
Okay, now we heard another one that's called a minor.

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,920
So this is another area that you study, but it is less important than your major.

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay, so major and your minor.

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,040
So let's give an example.

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,320
Imagine you must take 100 classes to graduate from university.

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,800
Maybe you have to take 50 for your major and maybe 30 for your minor.

78
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Okay, very good.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,200
And now on your degree, on your title, does it say what is your major and minor?

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,800
Well, I think it depends on the university, but in my case, yes.

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,840
Okay, very good.

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
So major and minor.

83
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Now related to this and what you were saying about your classes, it takes us to our next

84
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,600
word, which is credits.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Credits.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Credits.

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Credits.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Now, this is easily confused with classes sometimes.

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
That's right.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Well, a credit is kind of a point.

91
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,280
So like maybe, so in university, you need a certain number of credits or points to graduate.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,920
Okay, so suppose you need 100 credits to graduate.

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,600
So that's not 100 courses because each course might be worth four or six or eight credits

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,960
depending on how important it is.

95
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Very good.

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,640
So maybe the classes that are part of your major will have more credits.

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
All right, very good.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,280
So, and now we have our last word in this dialogue and it was tuition.

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,480
Tuition.

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,800
She had to pay her tuition.

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,000
So tuition is the money that you must pay for education.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Okay, only for education.

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's right.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,560
So, university tuition, private school tuition or even language course tuition.

105
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,640
Okay, so a tuition is the money you must pay for school only.

106
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Yeah.

107
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,200
So we've seen a lot of great words used for registering at university.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,440
So I think it's time to listen to the dialogue for the second time a little bit slower and

109
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:06,400
then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Excuse me, is this where I register?

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,720
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,640
Yes, of course.

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,320
I need your student ID, please.

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Here you are.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,920
Okay, Susan, it says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

116
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,760
Is this information correct?

117
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Yes.

118
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,200
I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Sure, that's not a problem.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,040
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

121
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah.

122
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Here's my list.

123
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.

124
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, that's perfect.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,640
What about the subjects for your minor?

126
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Oh, yeah.

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,360
I almost forgot.

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,880
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology and neuroanatomy.

129
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

130
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,800
Okay, here you go.

131
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You're registered now.

132
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,920
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,720
All right, so it's time for putting it together.

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,920
Putting it together.

135
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,000
And we're going to look at some phrases here that we can use to talk about education and

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,040
university and we can use them in different ways.

137
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,880
All right, and our first phrase is actually very similar to register.

138
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,920
To sign up for something.

139
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay, I want to sign up for.

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,000
I'd like to sign up for my courses.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,240
I think it would be a good idea if we listen to some examples of how we can use this phrase.

142
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,560
Example one.

143
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,640
I signed up for a one-year gym membership.

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,120
Example two.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,480
If you want to assist our meeting, you need to sign up first.

146
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Example three.

147
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I hate signing up for things online because they just send you spam emails.

148
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, so I can see that to sign up for something is to agree to take part in it.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Okay, so it's a little bit more informal than register.

150
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Yeah, exactly.

151
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Less formal.

152
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
All right.

153
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,320
So, moving on to our second phrase.

154
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,080
This is very important because it's often used improperly, right?

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah, people often make mistakes with this phrase.

156
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,320
All right, so let's look at this phrase.

157
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Second year.

158
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,400
So, she is in her second year.

159
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Now, it seems very simple.

160
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,600
So, why are we explaining this?

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, it often gets confused with grade.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,560
So, when we talk about university, we talk about first year, second year, third year,

163
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,800
fourth year.

164
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,640
We cannot say grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four.

165
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,400
Or year one, year two.

166
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,960
No, it's always first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

167
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,040
Okay, very good.

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Or last year.

169
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Yeah, last year.

170
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
My last year of college.

171
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Exactly.

172
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Very good.

173
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,720
So, now you know how you can explain to someone what year of college or university you're

174
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
in.

175
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Yes, that's right.

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Very good.

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,880
And we have one more phrase to you.

178
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,000
And it was when she was getting her class schedule.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,960
So, class schedule.

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Class schedule.

181
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Now, a schedule is the list of things you do at what time.

182
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Right, so it's the timetable of your day or your week.

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Yep.

184
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
All right.

185
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,560
So, your class schedule will say all the classes that you have and what time they're at.

186
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,400
So, what other types of schedules can we have?

187
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,640
You also have maybe a gym schedule.

188
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
That's right.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
Or even a work schedule.

190
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Right.

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,680
So, we have different types of schedules and you can use it depending on what you are doing.

192
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,000
Those are all the phrases we have for putting it together today.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:57,840
And now, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

194
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Excuse me.

195
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Is this where I register?

196
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,280
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

197
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,760
Yes, of course.

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,440
I need your student ID, please.

199
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,880
Here you are.

200
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,320
Okay, Susan.

201
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,800
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

202
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
Is this information correct?

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Yes.

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,200
I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

205
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Sure.

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
That's not a problem.

207
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

208
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Yeah.

209
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,280
Here's my list.

210
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

211
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,040
Yeah, that's perfect.

212
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,640
What about the subjects for your minor?

213
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Oh, yeah.

214
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
I almost forgot.

215
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,800
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

216
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Wow.

217
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,200
You're going to be busy this semester.

218
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,800
Okay, here you go.

219
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
You're registered now.

220
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,960
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

221
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,360
All right.

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,080
So we were talking about second year, first year, third year, etc.

223
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Yeah.

224
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,960
Now, there are also other names that we give to each year, both for high school and university.

225
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,880
And I think this is only for America.

226
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,440
Like in the United States, we don't do this in Canada, and I always get so confused.

227
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,760
So Marco, what is the name you give to first year students?

228
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay, so first year students are called freshmen.

229
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Okay, because they're fresh.

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Because they're fresh.

231
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,440
Yeah, they just came from middle school, they just came from high school.

232
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
All right.

233
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
And what about the second year students?

234
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
They're called sophomores.

235
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Okay, because they're soft.

236
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Well, it's not soft.

237
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
It's a sophomore.

238
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Like S-O-P-H.

239
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Sophomore.

240
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Sophomore.

241
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,920
And then third year students are called juniors.

242
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,960
Okay, because they're almost the, like junior manager.

243
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Exactly.

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,040
Because then last year students are called seniors.

245
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,640
So the oldest guys in the school.

246
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Exactly.

247
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,520
So you can say, yeah, I'm a sophomore at Arizona State University.

248
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,200
Okay, so we only use this in America though, right?

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Yes, yes.

250
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,600
And not only for university, but also for high school.

251
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Okay.

252
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
All right, guys, that's all the time we have for today.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,840
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.
