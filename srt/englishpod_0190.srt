00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,180
My name is Kathryn and today we have an elementary level lesson about food, one of my favorite

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,600
things to talk about.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,600
That's right.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,520
We are going to talk about food but specifically we're going to talk about a family barbecue.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,320
Okay, what is a family barbecue?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
Well, I'll just say a few words first.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,840
A barbecue is usually something that we do outside.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,480
We bring food, we play games, maybe have some drinks and a lot of the food is grilled.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,600
So that's what we're talking about today.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:46,840
We're going to hear this dialogue first and then we'll come back to talk about it.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,200
Yep, the steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,160
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,760
Yeah, good idea.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,560
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,520
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Great!

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,800
I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
the beers.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,480
This is going to be a great barbecue.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,880
Oh no, it's raining.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,440
Alright, we're back.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,120
So probably a couple of words you didn't really understand.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,040
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,560
Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
Lots of food words, Marco.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
The first one is barbecue.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,000
We were talking about that a minute ago.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,720
A barbecue is something we do usually for a special occasion or for dinner.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
It's a summertime thing.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,180
You go outside when it's warm and the entire family comes and we have food.

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,800
Sometimes people even bring food.

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Right.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,680
So usually as you mentioned, it's something that you do a barbecue.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,560
You have a family barbecue.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
But it's also a verb.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
To barbecue something.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,520
So to cook meat on a barbecue.

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,060
So that's cooking meat not in a stove, not with gas.

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,920
Usually it's under a fire or very warm intense heat coming from coals.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Exactly.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,040
And so before we cook food, usually before we cook meat on the grill, before we barbecue

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,880
it, we have to marinate it.

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,640
So in this situation, the steaks and the chicken are already marinated.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Okay.

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,600
So to marinate something or which is a verb or the steaks and chickens are marinated which

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,120
is an adjective.

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,640
So basically means that you have added spices and maybe some lemon juice, different herbs

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,720
or salts to the meats in order to give it flavor before you cook them.

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Exactly.

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,440
So in Indian cooking for example, you marinate with a yogurt sauce and you leave the meat

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
in the refrigerator for a whole night.

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,640
So marinating or to marinate is a process to give flavor to food.

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Very good.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Alright.

58
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,960
So we've marinated our food, our chicken, our steaks.

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
But also we have hamburgers.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
So we need hamburger buns.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
What are buns?

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Okay.

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,140
Buns are pieces of bread that are for special kinds of food.

64
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,560
So you have a hamburger bun.

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,120
It's a round piece of bread and the hamburger goes on one piece and under another piece.

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
A hot dog bun is different.

67
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,800
It's like a piece of bread that's folded and the hot dog goes in the middle.

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
So bun is a special kind of bread for these kinds of foods.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Alright.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,840
So remember, if you want to have a hot dog, you need to buy hot dog buns.

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,440
So people know already that you're talking about bread.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,760
And if you want to buy a hamburger bread, you say a hamburger bun.

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
That's right.

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,960
So hamburger buns and hot dog buns.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,560
But after we talk about having the hamburger buns, we discuss how many hot dogs we're going

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
to cook.

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,800
So the person says, we should cook a couple dozen hot dogs.

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Alright.

79
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,720
So a dozen is 12 units of something.

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Right.

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
So eggs are sold in dozens.

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
We buy a dozen eggs.

83
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,120
We buy 12 eggs.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Okay.

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,460
Or you can say half a dozen.

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
That means 6.

87
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,720
Half of 12.

88
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,240
But a couple dozen is usually around 24, 25.

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Okay.

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Very good.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,840
So a dozen hot dogs and they are also getting kebabs.

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
What are kebabs?

93
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,680
One of my favorite foods, kebabs are sticks or skewers of meat.

94
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,280
So you have a very thin stick and you put the meat on it and you put that on the grill

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,760
and you cook the meat on the grill.

96
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,280
So yeah, those are very common.

97
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,800
For example, in the Middle East, right?

98
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,080
You have kebabs, sticks of meat and also maybe some vegetables put on it and you grill them.

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Exactly.

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Very flavorful, very tasty meat.

101
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Alright.

102
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,920
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll come back shortly to look at some

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,600
more words.

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Yep.

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,960
The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns.

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,920
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,520
Yeah, good idea.

109
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,280
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

110
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,280
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

111
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Great.

112
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,560
I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for

113
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,620
the beers.

114
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,480
This is going to be a great barbecue.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Alright we're back.

116
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,800
So now why don't we go to a second part of language takeaway and take a look at five

117
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,440
more words.

118
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
Language takeaway.

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,240
Alright the first word that we're going to look at is lawn furniture.

120
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,080
So we're going to have lawn furniture outside.

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,440
Okay so before we even start thinking about food, we have to decide where people will

122
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
sit at this barbecue.

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,760
And so we have to find out how much lawn furniture we have.

124
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,240
Furniture can be a sofa, a table, a chair.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,980
We have furniture in the house.

126
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,560
But lawn furniture is furniture for the outside.

127
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
A lawn is the green grass outside your house.

128
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,800
So it's usually not going to be made out of wood for example because if it rains it might

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
get ruined right.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,400
So usually it's either plastic or maybe even rock or stone.

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Or metal.

132
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Or metal.

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
So that's what lawn furniture is.

134
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,080
Furniture that is made to be outside in your backyard for example or that sits on your

135
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
lawn.

136
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Exactly.

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,760
And so we're going to be on the lawn furniture.

138
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,000
We have the special thing for cooking meat outside, the grill.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,120
Okay so we mentioned that you grill chicken or you grill steaks.

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,320
But it's also a noun.

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
A grill.

142
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
So a grill, what is that?

143
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,320
A grill is like a stove for the outside but instead of having electricity to make the

144
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,200
fire we have gas or propane.

145
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,440
And this is something that we light on fire and we use coals to keep the insides very

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
warm.

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,400
And so this is just a way to cook meats or even vegetables outside.

148
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Okay perfect.

149
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
So that is a grill.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,560
And if you're going to cook foods or vegetables in this way, so you're going to grill them.

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Alright.

152
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,880
And well just in case it gets hot and you want to hide from the sun, we are going to

153
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,800
set up a tent.

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay a tent, you can sleep in a tent but in this case a tent is just a covering outside.

155
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,840
So maybe some cloth or some fabric that will stand over us when we sit down or want to

156
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
be outside.

157
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,960
It's also a way to protect us from the rain.

158
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,040
Alright so as you mentioned a tent is something that you set up temporarily made out of cloth

159
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,080
or plastic to protect you from the sun or rain.

160
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,440
Or if you're going camping you sleep in one.

161
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Alright and now that they have all the food, they need cups and then they mentioned this

162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,840
strange word, it kind of sounds French, serviettes.

163
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,640
So I do think it comes from the French word.

164
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
This is a British way of saying napkins.

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,920
So it's like paper for cleaning your hands and cleaning your mouth that you throw away.

166
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,960
Okay so you can say napkins or if you want to sound a little bit more fancier you can

167
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,600
say serviettes.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,200
And speaking of fancy, let's talk about beer.

169
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,120
Where do we keep beer?

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,840
It has to stay cold right?

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,360
Right so usually you would place it in a refrigerator but if you're outside or you're going camping,

172
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,760
you want to keep them cold or you want to keep something hot.

173
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,720
You place it in a cooler.

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,280
Okay so a cooler is a plastic bin or a plastic box that we put all of the ice in and the

175
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,200
drinks so it's not just for beer, it's also for coke and Sprite and all these different

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
drinks.

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,720
Right so it's usually made to keep something cool but as I said if you want to keep something

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
warm you can also keep it in the cooler.

179
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,260
It keeps the temperature of the foods.

180
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,920
And the nice thing is that it's not electric so you can use it anywhere.

181
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Right.

182
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
Alright so that's all the words for today.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time.

184
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,560
Yep, the steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns.

186
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,480
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

187
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,120
Yeah, good idea.

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,920
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

189
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Great!

191
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,200
We asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for

192
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
the beers.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,880
This is going to be a great barbecue.

194
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:48,320
Oh no, it's raining.

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Alright we're back.

196
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,160
So family barbecues and doing these things.

197
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720
Did you do these when you were young at home?

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
Do you still like to do it?

199
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
All the time.

200
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
I love barbecues.

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
It's one of my favorite ways to eat food.

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,360
The nice thing about a barbecue is you get to sit outside and relax and there's nothing

203
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
better than nice fresh grilled meat.

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,200
Right, and well you have all your friends over so you're having a couple of beers and

205
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,560
you're having some meat and it's actually a really nice way of just having something

206
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,920
at home with good friends and family, right?

207
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Exactly, and some of the most important barbecues we have are in the summer near July 4th.

208
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,180
And so people like to have July 4th barbecues where you celebrate Independence Day and sit

209
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,680
outside and drink and have hot dogs and hamburgers and macaroni and cheese.

210
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,360
Actually while I was in Chile I noticed that as well near their festivities for their independence

211
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,840
which is September 18th.

212
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,920
A lot of people get together and have barbecues and it's so so popular that pretty much every

213
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,320
house in the neighborhood you can smell somebody barbecuing on the weekend.

214
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,960
You're making me so hungry.

215
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,640
Alright guys so if you have any questions, any doubts or if it's common for you guys

216
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,600
to barbecue back home then why don't you send us a couple of comments at EnglishPod.com

217
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600

218
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:27,500
Bye!
