00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,840
My name's Erica and I'm here with Marco.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,560
Marco, hurry up!

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm coming!

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Hurry up, Marco, we've got a lesson.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,600
Okay, I'm here, I'm here.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,560
What did I miss?

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
The lesson.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,280
All right, sorry about that.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,200
We have a great lesson for you today.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,400
We have an elementary lesson.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,840
That's right, an elementary lesson about being in a rush and about giving directions when

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,240
you're in a car.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,360
Exactly.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,040
We're going to listen to two friends who are getting in a car and they're getting ready

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,160
to go somewhere and they're in a big hurry.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:56,200
So let's hurry up and listen to the dialogue.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Hurry up, get in.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,200
All right, man, let's go.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:12,680
Okay, make a left here.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,520
No wait, I meant make a right.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,680
Come on, speed up.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,640
Geez, what's the rush?

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
Don't worry about it, just drive.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,160
Oh no, the light is about to change.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Step on it.

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Are you nuts?

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm not going to run a red light.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,640
Whatever, just turn right here.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,360
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,720
Let's take a side street.

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Go on, get out of our way.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,160
Move, move.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,680
What's your problem?

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Geez, having a fit is not going to help.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,800
Here, I know a shortcut.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,240
Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,920
Let's go, let's go.

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Watch out for that lady.

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm going as fast as I can.

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, we made it, 5.58 just before the library closes.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,640
You're such a geek.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,840
So they were in a hurry and it was all just to get to the library.

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,520
Well maybe he was late returning a book or something.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,760
That's a bit dramatic just for returning a book.

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Yeah.

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
All right, why don't we look at our language takeaway for today.

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
Language takeaway.

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,360
Okay, on today's language takeaway we have five words for you today.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,880
Five really important and useful words that we found in our dialogue.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,400
So let's take a look at the first one.

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Step on it.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,880
Step on it.

54
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,280
Step on it.

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
Step on it.

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,920
So what does it mean when I tell you to step on it?

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
Drive faster.

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,280
Drive faster, right?

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Step on it.

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Exactly.

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,040
You might also say speed up.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Speed up, yes.

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Speed up.

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
That's exactly it.

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Our second word, speed up.

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,200
Also means go faster.

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Go faster.

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,920
And what about the opposite?

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
You might say slow down.

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Slow down.

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Yeah.

72
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,640
Okay, so speed up and slow down.

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,820
So our third word for today is having a fit.

74
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,280
Having a fit.

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Having a fit.

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Having a fit.

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,920
Well, this is a funny phrase and I think listening to a few examples of this phrase might help

78
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,800
us understand its meaning a little bit better.

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,040
Example one.

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,400
Geez, you don't need to have a fit.

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Nothing is going to happen if we're five minutes late.

82
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,920
Example two.

83
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:59,920
My boss is going to have a fit if I don't finish this on time.

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,240
Example three.

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,880
I almost had a fit when my boss told me I had to work this weekend.

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,060
Okay, great example.

87
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,800
So Erica, why don't you tell me what does it mean when you have a fit?

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,800
It means you get really angry and you can't control your emotions.

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,720
So maybe you start screaming and maybe some steam comes out of your ears.

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay, that's having a fit.

91
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Exactly.

92
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Excellent.

93
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Okay, let's take a look at our next word now.

94
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,600
Cut through.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
Cut through.

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
Cut through.

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,440
Cut through.

98
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,840
When you cut through something, it means you just go through.

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Go through.

100
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Yeah, quite simple.

101
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
It gives you the idea that you go through something quickly.

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Quickly.

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,080
So I can say, let's cut through the park.

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,320
Yep, or let's cut through the backyard.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, go through.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,760
And this takes us to our last word for today, shortcut.

107
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Shortcut.

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Shortcut.

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Shortcut.

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,840
Cut. This is a really common word and not many people know about it.

111
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Yeah, you're right.

112
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,480
It's two simple words that when you fit them together, the meaning changes.

113
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,220
It's a great example of this real English we talk about.

114
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,320
And it means to take a shorter way somewhere.

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Exactly.

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,040
So if I take a shortcut, I go the short way.

117
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay, so going back just a little bit to cut through.

118
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
If I cut through the park, that's basically a shortcut.

119
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Exactly.

120
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,560
All right, now it's clear.

121
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,920
Now it's time to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it's going to be slower so then

122
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:53,120
we can understand all these words that we've just talked about.

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Hurry up, get in.

124
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm in.

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Let's go.

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,480
Okay.

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Make a left here.

128
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,120
No wait, I meant make a right.

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,680
Come on, speed up.

130
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,880
Geez, what's the rush?

131
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,600
Don't worry about it.

132
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,840
Just drive.

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,080
Oh no, the light is about to change.

134
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
Step on it.

135
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,400
Are you nuts?

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm not going to run a red light.

137
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
Whatever.

138
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,920
Just turn right here.

139
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,460
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

140
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,240
Let's take a side street.

141
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,920
Go on, get out of our way.

142
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,400
Move, move.

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,280
What's your problem?

144
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,840
Geez, having a fit is not going to help.

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,800
Here, I know a shortcut.

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,520
Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

147
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,880
Let's go, let's go.

148
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Watch out for that lady.

149
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm going as fast as I can.

150
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
Yes, we made it.

151
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
5.58, just before the library closes.

152
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,920
You're such a geek.

153
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,840
Okay, well I think that was a lot more clear this time.

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,120
You know, there was some great language in that dialogue and I would like to look at

155
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,920
how we can put it together.

156
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Putting it together.

157
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,240
Okay, so today on putting it together, we have three phrases for you.

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,640
And we're going to show you how you can use these phrases like a native speaker.

159
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,360
Okay, so all of these phrases we heard in the dialogue, why don't we start with the

160
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,840
first one?

161
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,440
Make a.

162
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
Make a.

163
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,760
So in the dialogue, they say make a left here.

164
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah, and we can extend this phrase to say make a right.

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,480
That would be the equivalent of saying turn left.

166
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Or turn right.

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Turn right.

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
And there's one more.

169
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Make a u-turn.

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Exactly.

171
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,120
That means turn the car 180 degrees all the way around.

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
Make a u-turn.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,380
So make a left, make a right, make a u-turn.

174
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,880
If you're ever in a taxi and you're telling the taxi driver where to go, this is the perfect

175
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
way.

176
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
Make a left here, make a right there.

177
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,240
Okay, so let's move to our second phrase and it is, are you nuts?

178
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,360
Are you nuts?

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
Are you nuts?

180
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,080
So this is a great way of saying.

181
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,200
Are you crazy?

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,680
Are you insane?

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,400
Are you mad?

184
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
So when would we use a phrase like this?

185
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,560
If somebody has a bad idea that you don't agree with, you would say, are you crazy?

186
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,840
Or are you nuts?

187
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,400
So Marco, let's stop this podcast right now.

188
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Are you nuts?

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Okay, I think that's a good example of how we can use this phrase.

190
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Yes.

191
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
So are you nuts?

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,840
Are you insane?

193
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,380
Are you mad?

194
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,240
So let's listen to some examples of are you nuts?

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Example one.

196
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,160
You want to get married now?

197
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Are you nuts?

198
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,760
You only met her three weeks ago.

199
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,200
Example two.

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Are you nuts?

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm not going to cheat on the exam.

202
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,640
What if I get caught?

203
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,300
So I think that's clear and now we can move to our third phrase, which is, let's take

204
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,200
a side street.

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's take a side street.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,360
Let's take a side street.

207
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,040
Again, so if you're in a taxi, this is a great way to suggest a route or suggest a direction.

208
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,760
So we can take this phrase and extend it out with a few more words.

209
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,160
We might say, let's take Wilson Avenue.

210
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,080
Or let's take the highway.

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
So let's take a side street.

212
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,400
Let's take Wilson Avenue.

213
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Let's take the freeway.

214
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay, so now let's take a listen to this dialogue a third time at its normal speed and now you

215
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:20,560
can understand everything that's in this dialogue.

216
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Hurry up, get in.

217
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,480
Hi man, let's go.

218
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:37,120
Okay, make a left here.

219
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,960
No wait, I meant make a right.

220
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,040
Come on, speed up.

221
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Geez, what's the rush?

222
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,360
Don't worry about it, just drive.

223
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,600
Oh no, the light is about to change.

224
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Step on it.

225
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Are you nuts?

226
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm not going to run a red light.

227
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,040
Whatever, just turn right here.

228
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,760
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

229
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,160
Let's take a side street.

230
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,320
Go on, get out of our way.

231
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,560
Move, move.

232
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,120
What's your problem?

233
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,920
Geez, having a fit is not going to help.

234
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,200
Here, I know a shortcut.

235
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,680
Let's go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

236
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
Let's go, let's go.

237
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Watch out for that lady.

238
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm going as fast as I can.

239
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,240
Yes, we made it.

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,440
5.58 just before the library closes.

241
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,720
You're such a geek.

242
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,480
Well this dialogue is all about driving, right?

243
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Yes.

244
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,680
In North America, where both of us are from, driving is everything.

245
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,040
Everybody has a car.

246
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,640
When did you get a car?

247
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,280
My car I got when I was like maybe 19.

248
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Really?

249
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,520
But I learned how to drive and I was driving already by the age of 16.

250
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
Yeah, that's the thing.

251
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,760
In many countries you have to wait until I think you're 18 to drive, but in North America

252
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,320
everyone has a driver's license by the time they're 16 years old.

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,040
Because everything is so far away that you need a car.

255
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,720
Yeah, it's a lot less likely to have subways or trains to travel by in North America.

256
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,200
All right, so now you have all the tools necessary to give directions the next time you're in

257
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
a car or in a taxi.

258
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,400
Well everyone, I really hope you enjoyed this lesson.

259
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:26,680
Now I want to remind you all to come to our EnglishPod website at EnglishPod.com and here

260
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,520
you'll find a lot of tools to help you understand our podcasts better.

261
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:58,600
So with that, until next time, this is goodbye.
