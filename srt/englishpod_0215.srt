00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,640
My name is Katherine and today we're talking about one of our favorite topics here at EnglishPod

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,200
that would be food.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,280
We love talking about food and this time we are going to pick up some food at the deli.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
What's a deli?

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,960
A deli is a special store where a person can buy meat.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,520
Meat and cheese and in this case we're talking about special meats.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,200
It's not just like pork or beef which you could also buy at the butcher.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,760
It is cured meats, cold meats.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,460
So let's take a look at today's vocabulary preview to find out more about this special

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,200
kind of meat.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,520
Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,760
Alright so at the deli you usually pick up cold cuts.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Cold cuts.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,560
So basically the way that I used to remember cold cuts as a child was that cold cuts are

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,000
what you put on a sandwich.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
So sliced turkey, sliced chicken, ham, salami.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,160
Okay like pepperoni would be a cold cut.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
That's right.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,640
So cold cuts are meats that you serve cold normally.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,780
They're usually cured.

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,120
They're not like raw pork or raw beef.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
You put them on a sandwich.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,680
So cured meats would be like that they're smoked.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
They're not cooked.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
No they're not cooked.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
You're right.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,960
They're smoked or they're cured with a kind of chemical or brine.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,280
That means that they're preserved.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,400
They can last for a long time.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Alright very good.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,840
So that's what we're getting at the deli.

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,480
Usually at the deli you can pick up meats, cheeses, and pickles and all that.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
All that good stuff.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:47,400
Alright so why don't we jump into our dialogue and listen to it for the first time.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,440
Honey we're all out of wine and cheese.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Can it wait?

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm watching the game right now.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things.

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Fine.

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
What do you need?

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay pick up some cured meats to go with the wine.

45
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Maybe a pound of Polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami, and any other cold cuts that are on

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
sale.

47
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,400
I think I saw a promotion for pastrami.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,080
Also get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Whoa wait a minute.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Isn't that a bit too much?

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,720
I mean how much is all this going to cost?

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,020
Never mind that.

53
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,480
Get some dips as well.

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,280
Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dips and also some tzatziki.

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,720
If they have bean dip, get that as well.

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Last but not least, get some pickles.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,540
Is that all your majesty?

58
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
Very funny.

59
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
Get a move on.

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,320
People will be here any minute.

61
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Alright we're back.

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,680
So now we're going to go into language takeaway where we're going to take a look at six key

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,260
words.

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,960
Language takeaway.

65
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Alright so the first key word that we have, we actually talked about it already but just

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,480
to make sure that you got it.

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,520
Those are cured meats.

68
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Cured meats.

69
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,040
Well, to cure something is to preserve it in this case.

70
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,780
So be careful because to cure has a couple of different meanings but when we're talking

71
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,380
about food, something that is cured is preserved.

72
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,160
For example, pickles are cured in salty water.

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Brine.

74
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Oh is that what it's called?

75
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Brine?

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Salty water.

77
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
I don't know what pickles are.

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,400
But pickles are like, if you don't put them in brine, they don't taste all soury and nasty.

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,320
No, that's because they're cucumbers.

80
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,240
So a cucumber becomes a pickle after it's been cured.

81
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,640
So we could talk about pork but when pork is cured, it becomes ham.

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Okay.

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Awesome.

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,360
So cured meats are meats that have been preserved through some kind of process like using salt

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
or drying them.

86
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Okay.

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Awesome.

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,000
So a cured meat, I think maybe is liverwurst.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,920
Well, this is a German lesson now, not just an English lesson.

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,240
In English, we have a lot of words that come from German and one of these words is wurst.

92
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Okay.

93
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,600
And that means sausage, right?

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
That's right.

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Sausage.

96
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
So bratwurst, liverwurst.

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,760
And in this case, liverwurst, I'm sure you can guess what part of the pig that comes

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
from.

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Liver.

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Very good, Marco.

101
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
You get a star for the day.

102
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Awesome.

103
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Yeah.

104
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
No.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,400
Liverwurst is a kind of sausage that's made up of this part of the animal.

106
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Okay.

107
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,480
Actually, I've never, I don't know if I've had liverwurst.

108
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
What does it look like?

109
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Is it white?

110
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Is it red?

111
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Is it dark?

112
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
I think it's like light, purplish, whitish.

113
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
I don't know.

114
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
I've had bloodwurst.

115
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
That's good.

116
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Yeah.

117
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Blood sausage is delicious.

118
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Okay.

119
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,960
And well, apart from picking up meats and cheeses at the deli, you can also pick up

120
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
coleslaw.

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
All right.

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,160
Coleslaw is an American classic.

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm sure you could get this other places as well, though.

124
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:58,400
It's basically a cold salad that's made up of cabbage and carrots and maybe onions.

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
But generally, the sauce is white.

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,840
It's like a mayonnaise and vinegar sauce.

127
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,440
So it's very stringy, lots of thin, long pieces and the sauce is white.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Okay.

129
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Yeah.

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
I think this is a very American thing.

131
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm not really sure if I've seen coleslaw in many other places, but I personally don't

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
like it.

133
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Again, because of the whole vinegar thing.

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not a big fan of the bitter stuff.

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,760
I love, we also call it slaw, sometimes with a side of slaw.

137
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I love a hot dog with a side of coleslaw.

138
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Oh, really?

139
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
My favorite meals.

140
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah.

141
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
Oh, wow.

142
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Okay.

143
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
So coleslaw.

144
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Moving on, we have an interesting sauce.

145
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,240
It's Greek, I believe.

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
That is correct.

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
And I'm not going to try to pronounce it because I might mess it up.

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,880
So I'm going to leave that one to you.

149
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Well, I don't speak Greek, but this is how we say it in America.

150
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Tzatziki.

151
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Tzatziki.

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Okay.

153
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Tzatziki is a food that comes from Greece, like you said.

154
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,560
In America, we have a lot of different foods, in Europe too, wherever.

155
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,240
People come from all over the place.

156
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,460
And in America, we've adopted a number of foods.

157
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,060
One of these foods is tzatziki.

158
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,760
It's a white yogurt dip.

159
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Okay.

160
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,400
So usually in tzatziki, there is some onion, some cucumber, some pepper, but it's a really

161
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,680
good thick, creamy yogurt dip that you use with bread or chips.

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Okay.

163
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,580
And that's actually our next word.

164
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,920
You mentioned it's a dip.

165
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,280
So you're using that as a noun and that's our next word, dip.

166
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Dip.

167
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,480
So basically, a dip is a kind of food that you eat with other foods.

168
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Okay.

169
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
So it's like a sauce.

170
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Exactly.

171
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
It's a sauce for finger foods.

172
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,240
So basically, a dip is a food you eat with other foods.

173
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
So you can have chips and dip.

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,760
That would be potato chips with dip.

175
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,320
And sometimes you have tomato dip or cheese dip.

176
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,000
In this case, we have tzatziki or blue cheese dip.

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Blue cheese dip.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
But actually, it's also a verb, right?

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
To dip.

180
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,080
So when you take your potato chip and you dip it in the dip.

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
You can say that.

182
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Yes.

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Dip it in the dip.

184
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Okay.

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,200
So you dip your potato chip in the dip.

186
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Yes.

187
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Very good.

188
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,960
So those are all the words that we have for you today on Language Takeaway.

189
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,520
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency

190
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Builder.

191
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,320
Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

192
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,840
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Can't wait.

194
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm watching the game right now.

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,600
Your friends and family are coming over tonight, and we still need to get a lot of things.

196
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Fine.

197
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
What do you need?

198
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Okay.

199
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Pick up some cured meats to go with the wine.

200
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Maybe a pound of Polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami, and any other cold cuts that are on

201
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
sale.

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I think I saw a promotion for pastrami.

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Also, get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

204
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Whoa, wait a minute.

205
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Isn't that a bit too much?

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,480
I mean, how much is all this going to cost?

207
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
Never mind that.

208
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,360
Get some dips as well.

209
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,160
Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dips and also some tzatziki.

210
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,640
If they have bean dip, get that as well.

211
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,440
Last but not least, get some pickles.

212
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Is that all, Your Majesty?

213
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Very funny.

214
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,480
Get a move on.

215
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,200
People will be here any minute.

216
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,080
All right, we're back.

217
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

218
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Fluency Builder.

219
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,080
This first one is a very, very common phrase.

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,040
We use this a lot in English when we're maybe running late or you need something very quickly.

221
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,480
We say, hey, can you run to the store and get this?

222
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,800
Or do you mind running to the deli?

223
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,960
So the verb here is to run to.

224
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Run to.

225
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Run to the deli.

226
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Does this mean that you're actually going to walk very fast to the deli?

227
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
You're going to run?

228
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,080
No, this is not literal.

229
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,880
This is not, okay, I'm going to go to the deli and I'm going to get some food.

230
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,400
No, this is going quickly.

231
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,480
So I could say, Marco, I have no time.

232
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
Can you run to the store and get me some milk, please?

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,880
Okay, so that means just go really quickly in your car, your motorcycle, any way you

234
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
can.

235
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Or walking, yeah, exactly.

236
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Good.

237
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
So that's run to the store, run to the deli.

238
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,160
In this case, we saw it in the sentence, do you mind running to the deli?

239
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
So do you mind going quickly?

240
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
So this is going quickly.

241
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
Do you mind running to the deli?

242
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,000
This is a thing that we can do.

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,040
And so she was telling him what to get and he's like, whoa, this is going to be really

244
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,080
expensive.

245
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,400
And she answered with this phrase, never mind that.

246
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,560
Never mind that.

247
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,400
Okay, this is a phrase that we use when we want to say, don't worry about it.

248
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
That doesn't matter.

249
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
No problem.

250
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
It's not important.

251
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,520
So, never mind, you could say by itself, never mind, forget about it.

252
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,080
But never mind that is like saying, this argument is over, it's not a problem.

253
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
So never mind that.

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
As I was saying, let's go to the store.

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Okay, good.

256
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,600
So it's not important, it's not relevant, don't worry about it.

257
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Very good.

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,440
And the last phrase that we have for you is a very interesting phrase when the girl said,

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,520
you know what, very funny, but get a move on.

260
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,160
People will be here any minute.

261
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Get a move on.

262
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Get a move on.

263
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,440
So as we often say here at EnglishPod, this is the kind of phrase we have to look at as

264
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,900
a chunk, as a unit, as one piece.

265
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,720
You can say get, get me this, or I move, I moved my house.

266
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360
But get a move on means hurry up.

267
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Start leaving now.

268
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,000
Go, go to the store, be quick about it.

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,540
So this is a command.

270
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Get a move on.

271
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,800
Okay, so take it as a phrase, just like you know the phrase hurry up or go quickly.

272
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,640
Remember the phrase get a move on as a way of saying, come on, quickly, go, go, go, quickly.

273
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
That's right.

274
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,200
Or as I always say when I'm with friends and we're going slowly somewhere, I say, hey,

275
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,060
guys, let's get a move on.

276
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Let's get a move on.

277
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,240
They're going to close.

278
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Let's get going.

279
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Let's go here.

280
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay, very good.

281
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
So get a move on.

282
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Get a move on and why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for one last time.

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,720
Honey, we're all out of wine and cheese.

284
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,840
Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?

285
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Can it wait?

286
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm watching the game right now.

287
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,000
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things.

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Fine.

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What do you need?

290
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, pick up some cured meats to go with the wine.

291
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,160
Maybe a pound of Polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami and any other cold cuts that are on

292
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
sale.

293
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,200
I think I saw a promotion for pastrami.

294
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,240
Also, get some coleslaw and a jar of olives.

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
Whoa, wait a minute.

296
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Isn't that a bit too much?

297
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean, how much is all this going to cost?

298
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,300
Never mind that.

299
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,760
Get some dips as well.

300
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,560
Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dips and also some tzatziki.

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,020
If they have bean dip, get that as well.

302
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,820
Last but not least, get some pickles.

303
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,840
Is that all, your majesty?

304
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Very funny.

305
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Get a move on.

306
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:11,000
People will be here any minute.

307
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All right, we're back.

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,200
So now, Catherine, I understand you're a big fan of pickles and olives and all that stuff.

309
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,800
I love cured food.

310
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Oh, really?

311
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Pickled.

312
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,440
Have you ever had a pickled tomato?

313
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I hate pickled tomatoes.

314
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,960
Pickled tomatoes, pickled pickles, pickled olives, everything.

315
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I love it all.

316
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,240
I hate, I actually, there are a couple of things that I don't really like.

317
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,380
For example, coleslaw, you mentioned that it has cabbage in it and many people may know

318
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,680
this vegetable as this purple lettuce, right?

319
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,240
It looks like a lettuce, but it's purple.

320
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
That's right.

321
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
I hate it.

322
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
I don't like it.

323
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,600
And I actually hate olives and pickles.

324
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
I can't really eat them.

325
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,440
Sounds like you don't like bitter things like vinegar, olives.

326
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,280
Yeah, yeah, no.

327
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Not a big fan.

328
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm not a big fan of anything that's bitter.

329
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I love it.

330
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
It's one of my favorite.

331
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,480
I love salty foods and I love bitter foods and that's all I have to say about it.

332
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,760
I've never really understood how people have like a whole pickle and they take it out of

333
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,120
the jar and they just bite into it.

334
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,360
It's like, that's nasty.

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,800
Well, the adjective to describe a pickle's flavor is sour.

336
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Sour.

337
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,160
It's very sour.

338
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,760
And in America, at delis, you can buy full sours or half sours.

339
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Oh, really?

340
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,160
Some pickles are less sour than others.

341
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,200
We call it a half sour.

342
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,680
My favorite pickles are full sours.

343
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Really?

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,840
Make you cry a little bit.

345
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,000
The whole pickle thing, is this very American?

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,280
Because you always have pickles in burgers, for example, right?

347
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
You go to McDonald's, you have pickles in burgers.

348
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,560
Is this very American or is this coming from another place?

349
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,960
It comes from Europe.

350
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Oh, really?

351
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,560
A lot of German food involves pickles, pickled vegetables.

352
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,000
The Koreans also, Korean food has a lot of pickled vegetables like kimchi, which is pickled

353
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
cabbage.

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, that's right.

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
And in Chinese culture as well, a lot of pickled foods.

356
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,200
So I think this is something that's very common all over the world.

357
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
You can have pickled fish.

358
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Really?

359
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah.

360
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
You can pickle anything.

361
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,200
I don't know if we pickle things in Latin America.

362
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
This is why it seems very strange to me.

363
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,120
But this is a really interesting topic.

364
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,640
Why don't you let us know what your favorite cured meats are?

365
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,060
I know there are a lot of different types.

366
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,880
And if you like pickles or not, maybe some people out there will support me and say they

367
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
don't like pickles.

368
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
All right.

369
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,360
And if you have delis in your home country, let us know.

370
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
I've always been curious about this.

371
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,560
Do you have delis or do you just have a butcher shop?

372
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,920
What's the difference?

373
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Awesome.

374
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,880
So we'll see everyone there, EnglishPod.com.

375
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Until next time.

376
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Bye everyone.

377
00:14:35,880 --> 00:15:00,640
Have a great day.
