00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,320
Welcome back to another great lesson at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,520
And my name's Erica.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,760
And today we're going to be building something.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,120
That's right.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,240
We've got a lesson about construction.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
Cool.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,980
So we're going to be working at a construction site today and we're going to learn a lot

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,720
of cool vocabulary with different types of tools.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,000
And we'll also learn some phrases that you can use to talk about work.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,440
So even if you're not really interested in building and making stuff with your hands,

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,040
you will learn some language to talk about work in general.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
All right.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,960
So before we get started with this construction dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
preview.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,240
Well, Marco, we're going to look at two words now.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,320
And like you said, we're building something in this lesson, right?

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Right.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
We're going to be building a deck.

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
A deck.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
A deck.

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,760
All right.

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
So a deck.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
What is that?

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,520
Basically, it's an elevated wooden platform that houses will have like in their backyards

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
maybe.

29
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,360
So it's a platform that's a little bit higher off the ground behind your house.

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,760
So it's very popular for houses to have decks and people will put out a table and chairs

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,640
and maybe have lunch out there or something.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Or barbecue or something.

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Exactly.

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Yeah.

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Okay.

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
So a deck.

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, they're building this deck and they need to follow some plans.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Plans.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Plans.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,280
The plans that we're talking about are construction plans.

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Yeah.

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,560
It's kind of like the map for the deck.

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
How you're going to build it.

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Exactly.

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,120
So we can have floor plans, for example.

46
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,880
So that shows you how the building looks like where the different rooms are.

47
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,120
Like a house, right?

48
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,960
So it's basically the map for a construction.

49
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,280
Okay, great.

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
So two interesting words.

51
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,600
We're going to hear both of these in the dialogue.

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,080
Now why don't we get started and find out what's going to happen as they're building

53
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:05,080
this deck.

54
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,840
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've been hired to build a deck on this here house and

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,200
turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
There is one catch though.

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
We've only got one day to finish this.

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,240
So I'm going to need everyone to give 110% today.

59
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,560
It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here and I know that together we can

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
tackle this project.

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
That being said, let's get to work.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
That's right.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,440
Now remember, we've been over the plans, but we really need to make sure that everything

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,960
is up to code.

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough.

66
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,360
So please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,280
And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb, measure twice, cut once.

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,880
Okay, guys, let's get at it.

69
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,200
Bob, pass me that hammer.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
The nails won't go in.

71
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,080
The wood is too hard.

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,760
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

73
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
That did it.

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Hey, do me a favor and help me cut this two by four, will you?

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Pass me that circle saw and grab hold of the end of the board.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,480
Now help me drill some holes in it so we can place the bolts.

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,960
I think you should sand the edges.

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,640
Look at all these splinters.

79
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Someone could get hurt.

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,000
Geez, you've got to take pride in your work.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,160
Yeah, you're right.

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,240
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

83
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,040
Julia, get over here with that level, measuring tape, and that box of screws.

84
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Oh no, look out below.

85
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,800
All right, so there are a lot of people building the deck.

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,040
They have to build it fast.

87
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,840
They've only got one day.

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
So it's a really big challenge, huh?

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,600
Yeah, and I think this is a good lesson in maybe not rushing through important projects,

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
right?

91
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Exactly.

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,880
So we saw some really interesting tools that they were using.

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,000
So why don't we look at that first in Language Takeaway.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Language Takeaway.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,600
All right, so we've got some language all about tools.

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,360
So why don't we just get started?

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,960
So they mentioned a nail gun.

98
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Nail gun.

99
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
A nail gun.

100
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,280
So we all know about hammers and nails, right?

101
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Right.

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
So the nails are what you put in the wood.

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Exactly.

104
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,200
Now this is an advanced tool, so you don't have to use a hammer.

105
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:37,000
It's kind of hard to explain, so why don't we listen to the sound this tool makes.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Well, I guess like its name suggests, it's a gun for putting nails in wood.

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,640
Yeah, it actually uses compressed air to push nails really fast into the wood.

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
All right.

109
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
All right, so they are nailing some pieces of wood together, but they also needed to

110
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,000
cut the wood, and they said, help me cut the two by four.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,080
Yeah, she said, help me cut this two by four.

112
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
So a two by four.

113
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,880
This is a very popular type of wood that you use in construction.

114
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
A two by four is basically two inches by four inches.

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,800
So two inches high and four inches wide.

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,280
So it's the most popular and common type of wood that you would use for construction,

117
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,320
a two by four.

118
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,740
You'll hear it all the time.

119
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,960
So they're going to cut the two by four, and C said, pass me the circular saw.

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,240
A circular saw.

121
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
A circular saw.

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
So a saw, we understand, is something you use to cut wood, but you have many types of

123
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
saws.

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:51,280
You have a band saw, you have a circular saw, and this one makes this sound.

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
So I guess it's called a circular saw because the blade or the cutting part is shaped in

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
a circle.

127
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,620
Yeah, a circular saw.

128
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,040
So after they cut the piece of wood, one of the guys said, I think you should sand the

129
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
edges.

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
To sand something.

131
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
All right.

132
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,200
So if you want to sand usually a piece of wood, you want to use paper covered in sand

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,080
to make it very smooth.

134
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,200
Yeah, exactly.

135
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,240
And so they also mentioned a sander, right?

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,280
A sander is basically a machine that has this sandpaper on it and will do the hard work

137
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
for you.

138
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
All right.

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,120
So to sand something and a sander.

140
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,400
Now our next word is very related to sanding something because if you don't sand a piece

141
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,680
of wood, it might have splinters.

142
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Splinters.

143
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Splinter.

144
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Splinters.

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,480
So like I said, if you cut a piece of wood, there are little pieces of wood that stick

146
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,640
out and you can get hurt.

147
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
They can get under your skin.

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Yeah.

149
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,360
So tiny, tiny parts of wood.

150
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
That's called a splinter.

151
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
A splinter.

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Okay.

153
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,840
So why don't we go on to our next tool.

154
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,200
They were talking about a level.

155
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
A level.

156
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
The level.

157
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
All right.

158
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,200
So this is a tool that all carpenters have and it's basically a tool that has a little

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,680
bit of water in it, right?

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Yeah.

161
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,440
And it helps you make sure that everything is straight and flat.

162
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Exactly.

163
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
So that's a level.

164
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,680
Every carpenter has it.

165
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
And also a measuring tape.

166
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,920
A measuring tape.

167
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Measuring tape.

168
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,680
Now I'm sure if this was a video podcast, we could show you what a measuring tape was

169
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,280
and you'd really understand it, but we'll do our best to describe it for you.

170
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,560
So a measuring tape is like a ruler that rolls up.

171
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Yeah.

172
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,760
It's a very convenient ruler because it can roll up and you can measure something that

173
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,920
is maybe six feet or three meters long and you can extend it.

174
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,320
And when you're done measuring, you can put it back and just put it in your pocket.

175
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Yeah.

176
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Every carpenter has one.

177
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
A measuring tape.

178
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
All right.

179
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,400
So that's our last tool that we're going to talk about.

180
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,240
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder where we've got some phrases that you can

181
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,200
use to talk about work.

182
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,960
Fluency Builder.

183
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,200
So when the contractor started giving them instructions, he said, I need everyone to

184
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,960
give 110% today.

185
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,380
To give 110%.

186
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,120
So when you give 110%, you are basically trying very hard.

187
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah.

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,240
You give everything you have to your job.

189
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Right.

190
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,240
So it's not only 100%, it's 110, more than what's needed.

191
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,560
So no lunch break.

192
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Exactly.

193
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,840
So as they were talking about the instructions, one of the guys said, the carpenter's rule

194
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
of thumb.

195
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,040
A rule of thumb.

196
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,120
So this is an interesting phrase, rule of thumb.

197
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
What does that mean exactly?

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Okay.

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Well, you know what?

200
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,880
I think we can understand the meaning pretty clearly if we listen to some examples.

201
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,040
Example one.

202
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,000
The rule of thumb in making a sale is confidence.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,640
Without confidence, you don't make a sale.

204
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,080
Example two.

205
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,560
The tailor's rule of thumb is twice the circumference of the wrist is the circumference of the neck.

206
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,460
Example three.

207
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,000
You don't have to take everything I say about marketing as a rule of thumb.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,080
One of the guys noticed a few problems, you know, the splinters, and he said, you've got

209
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,400
to take pride in your work.

210
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Okay.

211
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,080
He said to take pride in your work.

212
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
To take pride in your work.

213
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,560
Why did he say that to her?

214
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
What is he trying to tell her?

215
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,120
Well, because she made some mistakes, she didn't do such a good job.

216
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,120
He's wanting her to work harder, work better, work more carefully.

217
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Okay.

218
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,960
And so she can be proud of her work and say, this is a job well done.

219
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,080
So when you take pride in your work, you work so well and do such a good job that you feel

220
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,360
really happy about it.

221
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
All right.

222
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Good.

223
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,960
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again for the last time and then we'll come back

224
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:58,800
and talk about construction.

225
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,520
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've been hired to build a deck on this here house and

226
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,900
turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.

227
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,320
There is one catch though.

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,500
We've only got one day to finish this.

229
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,960
So I'm going to need everyone to give 110% today.

230
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,240
It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here and I know that together we can

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
tackle this project.

232
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
That being said, let's get to work.

233
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
That's right.

234
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,120
Now remember, we've been over the plans, but we really need to make sure that everything

235
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
is up to code.

236
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough.

237
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,040
So please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

238
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,920
And remember the carpenters rule of thumb, measure twice, cut once.

239
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,760
Okay, guys, let's get at it.

240
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,880
Bob pass me that hammer.

241
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,120
The nails won't go in.

242
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,800
Wood is too hard.

243
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,480
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

244
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
That did it.

245
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,280
Hey, do me a favor and help me cut this two by four, will ya?

246
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,680
Pass me that circle saw and grab hold of the end of the board.

247
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,200
Now help me drill some holes in it so we can place the bolts.

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
I think you should sand the edges.

249
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
Look at all these splinters.

250
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
One could get hurt.

251
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,760
Jeez, you got to take pride in your work.

252
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Yeah, you're right.

253
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,960
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

254
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,600
Julia, get over here with that level measuring tape and that box of screws.

255
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,080
Oh no, look out below.

256
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:45,360
So an interesting aspect of North American culture is projects like this, right?

257
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,960
Building a deck or maybe adding a room to your house.

258
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah, that's right.

259
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,560
And we call this DIY.

260
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,760
Right, DIY, do it yourself.

261
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,680
So it's a very popular summer project, right?

262
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Right.

263
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,960
So if you live in a neighborhood in North America, you might see like, you know, the

264
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,080
dad of a family outside building something and all his friends come over and they, you

265
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,000
know, drink beer and build this big thing together.

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,160
So it could be a tree house, it could be a deck, it could even maybe be adding another

268
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
room to the house.

269
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Yeah.

270
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,080
And you know, it's actually, it's so popular that there are tons of TV shows about how

271
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,800
to build stuff for your house.

272
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,320
And there are a lot of really big stores where you can go and find like all of this equipment

273
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,040
for building stuff for your house.

274
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Right.

275
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,400
So basically there are these big stores where you can get anything from paint to wood to

276
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,240
tools, huge amount of material so you can do it yourself.

277
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
You can DIY.

278
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
All right.

279
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,440
So that's all the time we have for today but let us know what you think and tell us if

280
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,080
you are into doing handiwork like this, like maybe building a tree house or building a

281
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
deck.

282
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
That's right.

283
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,760
You can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

284
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
As well, you can also leave your questions there.

285
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
All right.

286
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,240
So we'll see you guys there and until next time.

287
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Thanks for listening and goodbye.

288
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Bye.
