00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,160
My name is Kathryn and today we're talking about going out for a drink.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
That's right.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,440
We're going to a bar and we're going to order cocktails.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,400
So we're going to learn all about the different types of cocktails and a little bit more language

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,960
that you can use at a bar.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Exactly.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,440
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:29,520
We'll be back in a moment.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
What can I get you?

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,080
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,280
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,440
That's a ladies drink.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
You're embarrassing me.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,920
It's a good drink.

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
It's too soft.

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,480
Order something with a little more kick to it.

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Fine.

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,600
I'll have a Sex on the Beach.

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,520
You have got to be kidding me.

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Come on.

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
It's delicious.

25
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,800
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Forget it.

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,160
I'm ordering for you.

28
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,560
I'll have a Scotch on the Rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

29
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
Put it on my tab.

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Here.

31
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,800
Now, this is a real drink.

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
It's strong.

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,040
This is going to get me wasted.

34
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
That's the idea.

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
All right.

36
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
We're back.

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,480
So now, let's take a look at some of those drinks on Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,440
Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,160
So in Language Takeaway today, we're going to focus on the names of drinks.

40
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,680
So we heard four of them in today's dialogue.

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
What was that first one, Marco?

42
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,320
The first one was a Cosmo or also called a Cosmopolitan.

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Okay.

44
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,880
So this is something if you watch the TV show Sex in the City, you will have heard before

45
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,640
because the girls always order Cosmos.

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,840
Now, a Cosmopolitan is served in a martini glass, right?

47
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Right.

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
You've seen the martini glass.

49
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,360
It kind of looks like a triangle.

50
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,800
And it's very easy to spill.

51
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeah.

52
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
That's right.

53
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
So what does a Cosmo have?

54
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,120
Because obviously, a cocktail is a combination of different liquors or alcohol with maybe

55
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,080
juices and stuff like that.

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
So what does a Cosmo have?

57
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,720
That's a good question.

58
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Cosmo is a vodka drink, I believe, and it's served in a martini glass.

59
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,400
But it's generally considered a drink for ladies, for women.

60
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Why is that?

61
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,880
Probably because it's a weaker drink, but also because it's popular in the media and

62
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,200
in movies and stuff as a women's drink.

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
So that's how it got that reputation.

64
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I see.

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
All right.

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Very good.

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
So that's what a Cosmo is.

68
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,000
And now we move on to another very popular drink, a little bit more tropical.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,280
I think everyone always has it when the Caribbean or when they're on vacation at the beach.

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,920
It's called a Sex on the Beach.

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Okay.

72
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,560
This name might make you laugh because Sex on the Beach, it's very descriptive, but it's

73
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
actually a very common drink.

74
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,040
And in the dialogue, he talks about how he likes to have this drink served in a pineapple

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
or a coconut.

76
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
So that means it's very fruity.

77
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,600
And I think it's a rum drink, right?

78
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah.

79
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,920
And it usually has either coconut juice in it or maybe some pineapple juice.

80
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Very fruity.

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Very fruity.

82
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,160
I think they add a little bit of vanilla or even ice cream or milk or something like that.

83
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
So it's very fruity.

84
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
It's kind of like a milkshake with liquor.

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Weird.

86
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Yeah.

87
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,880
I don't know that I've ever had one, but this is the part of the dialogue where his

88
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,680
friend says, come on, you need to buy something that's more manly.

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,480
He orders a Scotch on the rocks instead.

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay.

91
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,240
So a Scotch is a type of liquor.

92
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,720
It's a whiskey.

93
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
That's right.

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Scotch whiskey comes from Scotland and it's a whiskey drink.

95
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,240
And basically, Scotch on the rocks means Scotch poured over ice.

96
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Ice.

97
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,360
So, in this case, rocks means ice.

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
And you'll hear this often.

99
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
Do you want that on the rocks?

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,200
Do you want that on ice?

101
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Right.

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,400
So you don't say, I want whiskey with ice or you don't say, I want Scotch with ice.

103
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
You can just say on the rocks.

104
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Scotch on the rocks.

105
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,280
So it may be if you're ordering a rum drink and you don't want it mixed with anything,

106
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,000
you can say rum on the rocks.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
On the rocks.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Very good.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,880
And not only are we ordering a Scotch on the rocks, but we're also ordering a Manhattan.

110
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
So what does a Manhattan have?

111
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
All right.

112
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,080
A Manhattan is a very strong cocktail.

113
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,400
It has bourbon, which is a kind of whiskey.

114
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
It's an American whiskey.

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,720
It has vermouth, which is also a very strong ingredient.

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
It has bitters.

117
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,920
What is bitters?

118
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,160
Bitters is another kind of ingredient that is often used in cocktails to make things

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
bitter.

120
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Ah, okay.

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
So it's not a sweet drink.

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
No, no, no.

123
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
It's not a sweet drink.

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Although they sometimes put a little bit of lemon or orange rind in the drink and that's

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
the skin of the orange.

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay.

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,440
So both these drinks are pretty strong.

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,680
They're very interesting though.

129
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,160
All the ones that we've seen, the Cosmo, the Sex on the Beach, they're all called cocktails.

130
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,280
And a cocktail has the characteristic that it usually has alcohol, right?

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
That's right.

132
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,880
So cocktail is a mix of different ingredients, but it's an alcohol-based drink.

133
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Okay.

134
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,600
You can also get non-alcoholic cocktails.

135
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
So there is that option.

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
All right.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Very good.

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So why don't we take a break?

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,520
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

140
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
What can I get you?

141
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

142
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,240
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

143
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
That's a ladies drink.

144
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
You're embarrassing me.

145
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
What are you talking about?

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
It's a good drink.

147
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
It's too soft.

148
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Order something with a little more kick to it.

149
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Fine.

150
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
I'll have a Sex on the Beach.

151
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,480
You have got to be kidding me.

152
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Come on.

153
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
It's delicious.

154
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,800
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

155
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Forget it.

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm ordering for you.

157
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll have a Scotch on the Rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

158
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,000
Put it on my tab.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Here.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,880
Now, this is a real drink.

161
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
That's strong.

162
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,000
This is going to get me wasted.

163
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's the idea.

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All right.

165
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We're back.

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,080
So now, let's talk a little bit more about these drinks on Fluency Builder.

167
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,920
So Marco, there are many different ways to talk about drinks but the most important ones

168
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,680
that we often discuss, especially with cocktails, is weak drinks versus strong drinks.

169
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
That's right.

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
Weak drinks versus strong drinks.

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,320
Usually, the Cosmo or maybe the Sex on the Beach, it's considered to be a weak drink.

172
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
That's right.

173
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,920
So it's not very strong because there's less alcohol.

174
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,320
Like a Cosmo has fruit juice, like cranberry juice, and the Sex on the Beach is very fruity

175
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,040
so it makes it less alcoholy.

176
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
That's right.

177
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,960
And actually, those two also have one type of alcohol.

178
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,400
So it's not very strong.

179
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:47,160
Whereas, maybe a Manhattan has all this mix of bourbon and other drinks as well so it'll

180
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,880
be a strong alcoholic drink.

181
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Yeah.

182
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,400
And Scotch on the Rocks is also very strong because it's just scotch.

183
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Right.

184
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
You're not mixing it with anything.

185
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
No.

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
There's just some ice and some scotch.

187
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,920
So that's a strong drink.

188
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Okay.

189
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,920
So obviously, his friend was saying that all those drinks are too weak.

190
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,240
He should order something with a little more kick to it.

191
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
So in this context, kick means strength.

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,880
So alcohol.

193
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,240
He wants a drink that's not weak, that's strong.

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,880
So a strong drink has more kick than a weak drink.

195
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,080
So can we use this with food or with other situations?

196
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,160
You can, but with food, it usually means spice.

197
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,920
So Indian food tends to have a lot of kick to it.

198
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,720
That means it's very spicy.

199
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Okay.

200
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,880
So with alcohol, it's strong.

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,560
With food, it's usually spicy.

202
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
If this rice has a kick to it, it means it's a little spicy.

203
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
That's right.

204
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,840
So just think about kick as meaning that something is strong or has a strong flavor.

205
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Okay.

206
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Very good.

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,400
Now, when they were ordering, they didn't pay immediately because she said, put it on

208
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
my tab.

209
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
All right.

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,840
So to put something on a tab, this is really important when you're going to a bar or a

211
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
restaurant and you want to order drinks.

212
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,760
A tab is a bill that you don't pay immediately.

213
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,760
The bartender will write down all of the drinks that you have and all of their prices and

214
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,520
you pay when you leave.

215
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Okay.

216
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,720
So if you put something on your tab, you'll pay it later or when you leave.

217
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
That's right.

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,280
So normally at a bar in America, you say, I want to start a tab.

219
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,780
That means I want to start a bill and you give the bartender your credit card and he

220
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,960
will keep your credit card until you leave.

221
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Oh really?

222
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,200
So he keeps your credit card until you leave because obviously maybe you start a tab and

223
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,720
then you want to leave and you don't want to pay then it's a problem.

224
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,920
Or people get a little bit drunk and they forget they have to pay.

225
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,960
So bartenders now keep your credit card so that even if you forget to pay, they can charge

226
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
you.

227
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Oh wow.

228
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Okay.

229
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Very interesting.

230
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,680
And now for our last phrase, he was a little bit concerned because this drink is so strong.

231
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
He said, this is going to get me wasted.

232
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Okay.

233
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,160
So to be wasted or to get wasted means to get very, very drunk.

234
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,200
To drink too much.

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,880
So if you say I'm wasted, it means I'm very drunk.

236
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm very drunk.

237
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,120
You could say, oh, look at those, those boys over there.

238
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,280
They're all wasted.

239
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,760
They're all, you know, being drunk and sick and yeah.

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Okay.

241
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,680
So it's a very informal, very casual kind of a colloquial way of saying being drunk

242
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,120
or being intoxicated.

243
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
That's right.

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,320
So it's, it's something we often use with friends or as you know, with young people,

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,820
but it's not something you want to use in your English class because it's not a good

246
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
thing to be.

247
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,360
It's not a good thing to be wasted.

248
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Okay.

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Very good.

250
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,560
So now let's take a break and listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to

251
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:45,440
talk a little bit more.

252
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
What can I get you?

253
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,040
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

254
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,160
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,320
That's a ladies drink.

256
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
You're embarrassing me.

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
What are you talking about?

258
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
It's a good drink.

259
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
It's too soft.

260
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Order something with a little more kick to it.

261
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Fine.

262
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll have a sex on the beach.

263
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,440
You have got to be kidding me.

264
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Come on.

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
It's delicious.

266
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,680
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

267
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Forget it.

268
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm ordering for you.

269
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,480
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

270
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,440
Put it on my tab.

271
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Here.

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,760
Now this is a real drink.

273
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
That's strong.

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
This is going to get me wasted.

275
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,560
That's the idea.

276
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,380
All right.

277
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,840
So about cocktails, liquors, what is your favorite cocktail when you go out?

278
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,640
I almost always order gin and tonic.

279
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
That's my cocktail.

280
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
So gin is another type of liquor?

281
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
That's right.

282
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,120
Gin is another type of liquor like vodka or whiskey.

283
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,520
It has a very unique taste.

284
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,200
And tonic is a kind of water but it has a certain flavor to it.

285
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
It has a flavor to it.

286
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,080
So gin and tonic usually has some gin, some tonic water and some lime.

287
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,400
But the tonic water is kind of bubbly.

288
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,440
That's right.

289
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
It's bubbly.

290
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,920
I like bubbly drinks.

291
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,360
So you like champagne and stuff like that.

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Yes, exactly.

293
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I see.

294
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
What's your favorite?

295
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,840
I am a whiskey guy and so I usually order something like this scotch on the rocks.

296
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,720
I never like to mix it with anything else.

297
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,400
And especially I really don't like having sweet drinks.

298
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,000
So you're a purist.

299
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Kind of.

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,520
It's just that when the sweet alcohol and things that are sweet, I don't really think

301
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
go that well together.

302
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,080
No, I think I agree.

303
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,800
Although there are some sweet alcohols.

304
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Our Italian friends will be familiar with limoncello.

305
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,240
It's a dessert liqueur which tastes like lemon.

306
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,520
Or also Kahlua which is very sweet.

307
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,760
It's a coffee alcohol, right?

308
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Right.

309
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,880
So many people like to put Kahlua in their coffee to have Irish coffee.

310
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
That's right.

311
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:00,080
And actually the alcoholic world is very vast and actually many people don't drink alcohol.

312
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,200
Many people may have it occasionally.

313
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,320
But the other interesting thing is that usually countries have a national alcoholic drink.

314
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,440
So for example, the Mexican national alcoholic drink would be tequila.

315
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
That's right.

316
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Or Russian or Eastern European, vodka.

317
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,480
So in your country, maybe you have a local or a national alcoholic drink we would be

318
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,360
very interested to know about.

319
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
That's right.

320
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Let us know.

321
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

322
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
We'll see you guys there.

323
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
All right guys.

324
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
See you.

325
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Bye.

326
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:54,220
Bye.
