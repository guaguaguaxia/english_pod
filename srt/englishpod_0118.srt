00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,440
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,480
And today we have a fun dialogue.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
That's right.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,040
Well, maybe the language in this lesson you won't use every day, but it's fun, it's interesting,

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,840
and it's a little bit on the lighter side.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
That's right.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Today we're going to be looking at baby talk.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,040
So we're going to see some of these words that aren't really words.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,120
They're not real words that you can find in the dictionary, but native English speakers

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,360
use them when they're talking to little babies.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,160
Yeah, in many languages, there's a rule for how you make baby talk words, right?

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Right.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,300
But in English, we don't have really clear rules about how you make a word a baby word.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,280
So we're going to teach you a few of these baby words.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Exactly.

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,520
So before we listen to the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,440
Okay, we have two words here we're going to hear in the dialogue.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,360
And the first one is diaper.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Diaper.

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
Diaper.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,920
Okay, so a diaper, a baby uses a diaper.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
That's right.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,600
It's a piece of cloth or material that you put around the baby so that it can go to the

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
bathroom and not make a mess.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay, a diaper.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,480
Now we also have another word that we commonly use in the English language, it's Nana.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Nana.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Nana.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,920
So Nana is the name we call a grandmother.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,600
Right, so an informal name, just like in Spanish, we would say something like Abue or Abuelita.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
Or in Italian, you might say Oma.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,040
This is another way that we can call a grandma or granny.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Nana.

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,760
Okay, so Nana.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,520
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time, let's see how these new parents

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,760
are talking to their little baby using baby talk.

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Honey, the baby's up again.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,040
It's your turn.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,760
I went last night.

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,240
Fine.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,880
Hello, little baby.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Why are you crying, little baby?

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,160
Oh, I see, you made a doo-doo.

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,960
What's going on, hon?

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,840
Why is the baby crying?

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
The little baby made a doo-doo.

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
What a good boy.

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,240
Look at what I have here.

54
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Mickey Mouse jammies.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,960
Oopsie daisy, did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes, he did.

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Yes, he did.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,840
You just made a wee-wee all over daddy.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,640
Hold still while I change his yucky diaper.

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,440
What's going on in here?

61
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, look, it's Nana.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say hi to Nana.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, he's so adorable.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I could just eat him up.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, say hi to Nana.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hi, Nana.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hi, Nana.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hi, Nana.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hi, Nana.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hi, Nana.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Okay, say bye to Nana.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Time to go beddy-bye.

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:25,840
Okay, well, that was pretty cute, wasn't it?

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,160
A cute dialogue.

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,400
The baby seemed to be cute and, well, everyone's excited about the new baby.

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,020
But they use some really interesting little words that are pretty unfamiliar.

77
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,840
So let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,880
All right, so as we mentioned before, these words aren't actually words.

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
You won't find them in the dictionary.

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
Right, but you'll hear them commonly when people are talking to babies and you might

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,300
see them in a movie or something like that.

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,000
So why don't we get started with the first one?

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,960
All right, the first word that may seem a little bit strange.

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,160
The father said, hello, widdle baby.

85
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Widdle baby.

86
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,960
Okay, widdle.

87
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,920
So widdle is just a baby talk way of saying little.

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Little, that's right.

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,320
Now the father saw that the baby was crying because he made a doo-doo.

90
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,960
The baby made the doo-doo, not the father.

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,480
Right, the baby made a doo-doo.

92
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
A doo-doo.

93
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,960
Okay, so basically a doo-doo is when the baby poos or poops in the diaper.

94
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay, so, you know, sometimes you go to the bathroom and it might take a little bit longer.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Exactly.

96
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
That's because of the doo-doo.

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
The doo-doo.

98
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,800
Right, the actual technical or maybe the proper English word for this would be defecate.

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,240
Okay, so make a doo-doo.

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,960
All right, now our third words are interesting because he said icky diaper.

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,240
That's right, an icky diaper.

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,360
And then he also said yucky.

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,380
So we've got two words here that mean the same thing, icky and yucky.

104
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,160
And basically means disgusting.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,880
Right, something that's really, really not nice.

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
So you would say icky or yucky.

107
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,480
Now these words have other similar words.

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,440
We might recognize ick or yuck.

109
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,560
Right, so you would use ick or yuck if something is disgusting, but when you're kind of talking

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
to a baby, you would say icky, yucky, smelly.

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,540
Yes, the adjective.

112
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,440
Now our next word, the father said he has some Mickey Mouse jammies.

113
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Jammies.

114
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Jammies.

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
Okay, so what are jammies?

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Well the word jammies is short for pajamas.

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,800
Okay, pajamas, so the clothes that you put on when you go to sleep.

118
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Jammies.

119
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Jammies.

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,560
All right, and now for our last two words, they mean the same thing as well.

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,460
The little baby tinkled all over daddy.

122
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,360
So to tinkle.

123
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
And then his mom said a wee-wee all over daddy.

124
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
You made a wee-wee.

125
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,600
Okay, so tinkle and wee-wee.

126
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,840
Usually also going to the bathroom, but this time to pee.

127
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,320
To pee, exactly.

128
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
To urinate.

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,400
A wee-wee.

130
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,880
So the verb to tinkle and the noun a wee-wee.

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Very good.

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,880
So these are the words that we have for you today in language takeaway.

133
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
As you can see, they're kind of cute and very common when you're talking to babies and you

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
know, you have to be a little bit nicer.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,280
All right, so why don't we listen to the dialogue another time, a little bit slower, and you'll

136
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,920
catch these words a little bit easier.

137
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,280
Honey, the baby's up again.

138
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
It's your turn.

139
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,400
I went last night.

140
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,840
Fine.

141
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,080
Hello, little baby.

142
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,440
Why are you crying, little baby?

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh, I see.

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,360
You made a doo-doo.

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
What's going on, hon?

146
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,040
Why is the baby crying?

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,520
The little baby made a doo-doo.

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
What a good boy.

149
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,760
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

150
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
Look at what I have here.

151
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Mickey Mouse jammies.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,920
Oopsie daisy.

153
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,280
Did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

154
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes he did.

155
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Yes he did.

156
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,800
You just made a wee-wee all over daddy.

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,880
What's going on in here?

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,200
Oh, look, it's Nana.

160
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Say hi to Nana.

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh, he's so adorable.

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,440
I could just eat him up.

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,720
Okay, say bye to Nana.

164
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Time to go beddy-bye.

165
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,760
All right.

166
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,200
So now that we've seen those great words, let's take a look at two phrases that we're

167
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,880
going to look at now in Fluency Builder.

168
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,000
Fluency Builder.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,900
So the mother didn't really want to get up and look after the baby.

170
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,700
She said, it's your turn.

171
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
It's your turn.

172
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,860
It's your turn.

173
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,520
So when she says, it's your turn.

174
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,360
That means you should do it now.

175
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Right.

176
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
So she's basically saying, now you have to do it.

177
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,720
I did it last time, so now you have to do it.

178
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
It's your turn.

179
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
That's right.

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
It's your turn.

181
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,040
And, well, the Nana, the grandmother, she was really, of course she really loves this

182
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,520
little baby, and she said, I could just eat him up.

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,480
I could just eat him up.

184
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,760
I could just eat him up.

185
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Now does she want to really eat him?

186
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
No, of course.

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Of course not.

188
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,440
So what does she mean by this?

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,840
This is a phrase we often use with very cute things.

190
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,600
It just means, oh my God, he's so cute.

191
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay, he's so cute that I wish I could just hug him and kiss him a lot.

192
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,960
Yes, we might use this with babies or maybe with puppies.

193
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,720
I could just eat him up.

194
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
All right.

195
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,440
So great two phrases that we've just taken a look at.

196
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,480
Let's go back to our dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a

197
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,680
little bit more about these babies.

198
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:21,360
Honey, the baby's up again.

199
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
It's your turn.

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,240
I went last night.

201
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,880
Fine.

202
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,760
Hello, little baby.

203
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,840
Why are you crying, little baby?

204
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,040
I see you made a doo-doo.

205
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,880
What's going on, hon?

206
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Why is the baby crying?

207
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,440
The little baby made a doo-doo.

208
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,880
What a good boy.

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

210
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
Look at what I have here.

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,800
Mickey Mouse jammies.

212
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,640
Oopsie daisy.

213
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,000
Did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes he did.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes he did.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,720
You just made a wee-wee all over daddy.

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,200
Hold still while I change his yucky diaper.

218
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,080
What's going on in here?

219
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,840
Oh look, it's Nana.

220
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Say hi to Nana.

221
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Oh, he's so adorable.

222
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
I could just eat him up.

223
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Okay.

224
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,400
Say bye to Nana.

225
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Time to go beddy-bye.

226
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:36,480
Okay, so they are obviously new parents.

227
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,080
They've just had a baby, so they're excited about him waking up.

228
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,180
They're all excited about the baby and how he wakes up and everything.

229
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,360
But an interesting thing, the baby was sleeping in another room.

230
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,040
In English-speaking countries, people have sort of two different opinions about how you

231
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,520
should sleep with your baby.

232
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,800
Some people want to have the baby in the bed with them, right?

233
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,600
But some people think, no, the baby should definitely sleep in its own room.

234
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,680
Okay, in another room in a crib.

235
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Yeah.

236
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Right.

237
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,280
I think this is a very important issue because many people consider that it's a good thing

238
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,440
for the baby to sleep with the parents and it feels safe and you can make sure the baby's

239
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
okay.

240
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,120
And it's easier for waking up to feed the baby and change his diaper.

241
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Exactly.

242
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,120
And well, if the baby is sleeping with its parents, it might not wake up as much.

243
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,320
But other people think if you let the baby sleep with the parents, the baby will become

244
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,240
kind of spoiled and not a very good baby.

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Right.

246
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,400
It might become too dependent on the parents.

247
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,920
And for example, if you ever want to go out or leave the baby with a babysitter or when

248
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,120
the baby starts maybe preschool or kindergarten, it might not be really independent.

249
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,280
So why don't you tell us what you think?

250
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,240
Do you think it's a good idea to allow a baby to sleep with you or should it sleep in its

251
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
own room?

252
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,560
Yeah, you can tell us at our website EnglishPod.com where you can also ask any questions you have

253
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,200
about the language in this dialogue.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,400
All right, guys.

255
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
So we'll see you there and until next time.

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.

257
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:22,860
Goodbye!
