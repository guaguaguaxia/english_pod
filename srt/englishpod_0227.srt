00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,900
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about weddings.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,900
That's right.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,000
We are having a wedding but we're actually planning all the things out for the wedding.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
So there are lots of things to think about when you're planning a wedding and I don't

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,400
think that the woman in today's dialogue has forgotten anything.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Let's take a listen to the dialogue first and we'll be back in a moment.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,520
Trina, will you marry me?

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,160
Yes, yes, yes!

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,400
Jared, of course I'll marry you.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,840
Oh babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
laughter.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,360
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,760
Oh Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,320
I hope you don't mind but I've already chosen a date, six months from now in the summer.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,200
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I had plenty of time to start planning.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
She what?

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,700
Oh, don't worry sweetie.

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,800
I didn't know when you were going to propose.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,860
It was still a nice surprise.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,040
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out.

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,880
There's almost nothing left to do.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,400
I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
400?

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,120
No need to sweat it.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,180
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,200
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
venue.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,160
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle of

33
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,040
course would be officiating.

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,760
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counselling.

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,400
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,680
My stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that.

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,760
My cousin will be the official photographer.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,960
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,760
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,520
And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
and will get the youth group to serve us.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
they might have to tone it down a bit.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,800
Or we could hire a DJ.

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,160
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,360
What's their name again?

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,160
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding and our theme colour

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,080
would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine.

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,280
And there would be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
toasts.

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,440
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favours?

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,360
Who else am I missing?

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake.

54
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh wow.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,320
See, it's going to be wonderful.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,240
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

57
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:47,520
If I survive the next six months.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Alright we're back.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,920
So she talked a lot.

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,600
So there are a lot of words and phrases here that we're going to take a look at.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,920
So let's start with a couple of them on Language Takeaway.

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,600
Language Takeaway.

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,040
Alright so on Language Takeaway, why don't we start off with the first word and the basic

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
one.

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,280
When you plan a wedding, the guy needs to propose.

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Or the woman.

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Let's be 21st century here.

68
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,560
Normally it's the man but to propose in this instance means to propose marriage.

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,360
So basically this is the part where someone gets down on his knee and he says, you know,

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,960
sweetie pie, I want to be with you forever.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Will you marry me?

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Right.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
To propose.

74
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,520
So to propose is to ask someone to marry you.

75
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
That's right.

76
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
But it can also mean something else, right?

77
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
To suggest.

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
That's right.

79
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,680
So I could propose an idea.

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Or I could propose a plan.

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,840
But in this case, to propose has another meaning and it's basically to ask someone to marry

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
you.

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Okay.

84
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Very good.

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,160
So now we've proposed to someone.

86
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,960
So we need to start planning our wedding and I think one of the first steps is you need

87
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,080
to know how many people are going to be there and who you're going to invite.

88
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
That's right.

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,160
So when you're planning a wedding, you have to think about the people that are going to

90
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,280
attend the wedding so you prepare a guest list.

91
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Okay.

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
So a guest list.

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
Now it's pretty simple, right?

94
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,800
You have a list where you put everyone's name there and you know how many people are coming.

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Exactly.

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Okay.

97
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
A guest list.

98
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,280
Now you have your guest list and now you need to pick a place where your wedding will be.

99
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
That's right.

100
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,120
So we often talk about two parts to a wedding.

101
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,240
The first part is the ceremony, the wedding ceremony.

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
Maybe if you're religious, that happens in a church.

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

104
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,840
But there's a party afterwards and that's what we're talking about here.

105
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
We're talking about a reception.

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Okay.

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,520
A reception is basically the party part of the wedding where you drink and eat and listen

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
to music and dance.

109
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,040
So obviously for that, you need a space, a place to have the party and we call it the

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
reception venue.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Okay.

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
A venue.

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,960
So as you said, the reception is the party and the venue is the place where you have

114
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
it.

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
Now a venue is not a specific word, right?

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
You can use venue for many different places.

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
That's right.

118
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,120
So for example, someone's having a concert, I can ask him, hey, what's the venue?

119
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay.

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,280
That means what is the theater or where's this place you're going to have the concert?

121
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay.

122
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,800
So for example, a stadium can be a venue or a restaurant can be a venue.

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Exactly.

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,520
So a venue is a place where an event can be held.

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Okay.

126
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Very good.

127
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,240
So now we have our reception venue.

128
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,480
We have our guest list and the girl was talking about her uncle officiating.

129
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
What does she mean by to officiate?

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Okay.

131
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,580
So like you said, the verb here is to officiate.

132
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,200
Her uncle will be officiating.

133
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,960
That means he will be the person who marries them.

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,840
So maybe you've seen movies before where there's a priest who says, you know, do you take this

135
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,080
woman to be your lawfully wedded wife until death do you part?

136
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,680
That person who says that, the person who asks the questions, he or she officiates.

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Okay.

138
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Officiate.

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,480
So that's basically the action of marrying someone or leading the ceremony.

140
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
That's right.

141
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,160
And in America, this isn't just anybody.

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,240
Someone has to have a license or has to be a priest and has to have the authority to

143
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
officiate.

144
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Okay.

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Very good.

146
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,120
So that's a very interesting word there too, officiate.

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,760
Now moving on, when we talk about the food for the reception venue, well, we need somebody

148
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,960
to cook it and prepare it and that's when we hire caterers.

149
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
That's right.

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,960
So a caterer is kind of like a cook, but a caterer basically arranges a meal for many

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,400
people.

152
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
And usually the person will bring the food to you.

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,080
So for example, if we're going to have a party, Marco, and we're going to throw it at a venue

154
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,280
10 miles away, the caterer will bring the food to us.

155
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Okay.

156
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,560
So that's a caterer.

157
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,640
You get someone to cater your wedding.

158
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
That's right.

159
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Or cater a party.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,840
So I've had parties before that I've called caterers to make the food for.

161
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,760
So basically they work with me and I tell them the kind of food I would like and they

162
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
prepare it.

163
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Okay.

164
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Very good.

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,680
And now for our last part for the wedding planning, you have the food, you have the

166
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,080
venue, you have everything, but you also need to decorate a little bit and this is when

167
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,160
you call a florist.

168
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Florist.

169
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,680
So this sounds a lot like flower, right?

170
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Florist flower.

171
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,120
And that's basically what this person does.

172
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,960
A florist is a person who prepares flowers or who cuts flowers and uses them to decorate.

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Okay.

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,560
So you go to the florist to buy flowers, roses and different types of things.

175
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Okay.

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
A florist.

177
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Very good.

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,680
So we have six key words there that are related to planning a wedding.

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,600
Why don't we move on now to a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

180
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Fluency Builder.

181
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
All right.

182
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,680
So this first phrase is a really good one.

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a little bit gross.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,160
We're talking about sweat.

185
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,600
The woman in this dialogue says, hey, no need to sweat it.

186
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
So what does this mean?

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
All right.

188
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,320
So if you say to sweat means when you're running, you're doing exercise, it's hot, water starts

189
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,280
to come out of your skin.

190
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Yummy.

191
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Right.

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,440
But if the person says, hey, don't sweat it or no need to sweat it, it's a colloquial

193
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,360
way of saying, don't worry.

194
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Okay.

195
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,600
So we're not actually talking about sweat here.

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,840
So maybe Marco, you and I are working on a project together and I say, listen, Marco,

197
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm so sorry.

198
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,840
I have a family emergency.

199
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,800
I can't finish the project with you.

200
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Would you be able to help me out?

201
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm so sorry.

202
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Sure, sure.

203
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Don't sweat it.

204
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
It's not a problem.

205
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Okay.

206
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
So don't worry.

207
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Don't worry.

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Right.

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,440
So if you tell someone to not sweat it, don't sweat it, or no need to sweat it, you're basically

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
telling them it's okay.

211
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
It's not a problem.

212
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,200
Everything's going to be fine.

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Great.

214
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,080
So the next phrase here is also kind of relaxed.

215
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,760
It's kind of laid back.

216
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,080
So the woman is still describing some of the things she's prepared for the wedding and

217
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,240
she says, hey, listen, don't worry.

218
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,920
The music was a no brainer.

219
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Okay.

220
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
No brainer.

221
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Okay.

222
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
This is really easy.

223
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,880
Well, your brain is inside your head, right?

224
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,520
So if you say no brainer, it's basically saying you don't have to think about it too much

225
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,440
or it's very easy, very simple.

226
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Okay.

227
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,560
So I was deciding on where to go on vacation and the options were Thailand or Antarctica.

228
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
That's a no brainer.

229
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Thailand.

230
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
Obviously, I want to go where it's sunny and warm.

231
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,380
So a no brainer means I didn't even have to think about it.

232
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
It was that easy.

233
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
Right.

234
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,920
The decision making was a no brainer.

235
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,360
All right.

236
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,720
So for our next phrase, the girl was also talking about the music and she was talking

237
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,800
about a band, maybe like a rock band and she said, well, maybe they could play, but they

238
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,000
would need to tone it down.

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,840
So this is a favorite phrase of parents, I think, all over the English speaking world.

241
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,200
Tone it down.

242
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,820
In this case, we're talking about music.

243
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,040
So maybe like you said, the friend's band is a rock and roll band and it's really loud

244
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,120
and angry and in your face, but for a wedding, that's not appropriate.

245
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,080
So to tone it down means to make it more appropriate for the occasion.

246
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,760
So maybe less loud or no offensive language or no swear words.

247
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Right.

248
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,960
That's basically what tone it down means, right?

249
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,920
If someone says you need to tone it down, it's a little bit more direct.

250
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,480
Like you said, if your parents tell you this, it's maybe because you're being a little bit

251
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,240
too loud or you're yelling or you're being irrespectful.

252
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,160
So that's why your parents would tell you, hey, you need to tone it down a bit.

253
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
That's right.

254
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,080
Or sometimes we have this in the office where someone doesn't understand how to communicate

255
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
in a positive way.

256
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,240
And so they say, oh, that paper you did was really bad.

257
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
It was stupid.

258
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,680
I don't ever want to see it again.

259
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,560
Say, well, maybe you need to tone it down a little bit.

260
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,840
Think about the words you're using and make them a little bit less harsh.

261
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:15,840
So kind of to relax, to reduce your level of being aggressive, being loud, that's to

262
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
tone it down.

263
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Exactly.

264
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Okay.

265
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
A lot of great phrases there.

266
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,700
Why don't we now go back, listen to our great dialogue one last time and we'll be back to

267
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:33,160
talk a little bit more.

268
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,520
Trina, will you marry me?

269
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,920
Yes, yes, yes.

270
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,320
Jared, of course I'll marry you.

271
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,760
Oh babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

272
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,720
I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the

273
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
laughter.

274
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,280
I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

275
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,640
Oh Jared, I can't wait for our wedding.

276
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,320
I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date six months from now in the summer.

277
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Melissa saw you buying the ring last month, so I had plenty of time to start planning.

278
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
She what?

279
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,680
Oh don't worry sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose.

280
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,740
It was still a nice surprise.

281
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,160
As I was saying, I've got it all planned out.

282
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,760
There's almost nothing left to do.

283
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,400
I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly 400 guests attending.

284
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
400?

285
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,000
No need to sweat it.

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,080
My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be a low budget anyway.

287
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,120
So roughly 400 people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
venue.

289
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,320
I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church, and my uncle of course

290
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
would be officiating.

291
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,640
We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counselling.

292
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,280
The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.

293
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,540
My stepsister and her string quartet will take care of that.

294
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,640
My cousin will be the official photographer.

295
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,640
Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer?

297
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,400
And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet

298
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,080
and will get the youth group to serve us.

299
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,080
I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night, though

300
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,280
they might have to turn it down a bit.

301
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,680
Or we could hire a DJ.

302
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,040
Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings.

303
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,240
What's their name again?

304
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,040
I was thinking that we could have an island paradise themed wedding, and our theme colour

305
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,980
would be a soothing blue-like aquamarine.

306
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,200
And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts.

307
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,280
What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favours?

308
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Who else am I missing?

309
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh, your uncle could be our florist, and his wife could make our wedding cake.

310
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Oh wow.

311
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,200
See, it's going to be wonderful.

312
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,120
Oh, this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

313
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:48,640
If I survive the next six months.

314
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,840
Alright so about weddings and planning out a wedding, do you think 400 guests is a small

315
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
wedding?

316
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
No.

317
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,800
No, this woman is out of control.

318
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,960
In fact, in English, we have a word for a bride, or like a woman who's getting married,

319
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,080
that describes someone who's completely nuts about the wedding.

320
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
We call her a bridezilla.

321
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Bridezilla.

322
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Like Godzilla.

323
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Exactly, the movie Godzilla.

324
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
He's a monster.

325
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
And he's out of control.

326
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,400
He's out of control.

327
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,560
And a bride who's so obsessed with her wedding that nothing else is important, she is a bridezilla.

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Now it's a very big thing for a woman, right, for her wedding to be nice and perfect and

329
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
everything.

330
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Do you think guys are more relaxed in this sense?

331
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
I don't know.

332
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,240
I think it depends on the guy, as always.

333
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,320
There are some people who want to be very involved, and some people who don't care.

334
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,960
But in general, I think men are less worried about the details.

335
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,040
Just as long as there's a wedding, it's fine.

336
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Exactly.

337
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,200
Although a lot of men, when the wedding actually happens, start to get very nervous.

338
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,000
But kind of like having doubts, maybe cold feet.

339
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
Yes, cold feet.

340
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Like should I get married?

341
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,440
Should I not get married?

342
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,000
I think it's very interesting because you see this in movies a lot.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,360
And I've always wondered how often or how common is it for a guy or a girl to say no

344
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,960
or to leave a wedding when it has already started.

345
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Because you know, you have invited all these people, all these friends and family, maybe

346
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,840
people came from different countries, and food is paid for, venue.

347
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,960
You spend so much money on a wedding and for you to say no.

348
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200
I don't know how common it is.

349
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,640
It's very common in movies, but I really don't know anyone who's experienced this.

350
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,600
I don't either, actually, now that you bring it up.

351
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
So maybe we could talk about this.

352
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,040
Is this common in your country?

353
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,680
First of all, do people spend a lot of money on weddings?

354
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,440
And second of all, have you ever heard of someone actually leaving the wedding before

355
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
they finished?

356
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,160
Yes, during the ceremony.

357
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Not before, during.

358
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
During the ceremony.

359
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,280
So our website is EnglishPod.com.

360
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,480
And we hope to see you there.

361
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Until next time.

362
00:15:50,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Bye.
