00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,780
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,960
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a kind of education that is quite unique

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,440
actually a little bit different from the kind of education that most people get.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
That's right.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,640
So we normally go to school to learn but on this occasion we're going to talk about a

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,320
different way of obtaining your education.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,040
We're talking about homeschooling someone.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,640
Let's check this word out in today's vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,920
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,320
Alright so the word is homeschool, to homeschool someone.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,240
It's I guess a verb.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,440
And what does it mean if you're homeschooled?

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,360
Well you think about the word school, home, it means that you study at home.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,560
But you don't go to school every day.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,400
Instead you have a parent or maybe a friend of a parent who comes to your house to teach

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,960
you every day.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,940
So it's basically like having a tutor for but not to help you with school but to actually

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,040
teach you everything that you learn at school.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,300
That's right and some people are homeschooled with their siblings, so brothers and sisters.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,640
Other people are homeschooled alone.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:17,680
We'll talk about some of these things in a moment but let's take a listen to our dialogue.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,880
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
What?

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Why?

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,160
Well our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,160
I've been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,240
Like what?

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,400
I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
interaction.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,440
Well first of all I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,320
more relaxed and fun way.

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,280
I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,480
his or her strengths or weaknesses.

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,200
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,960
Good luck with that.

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,440
All right we're back so now let's take a look at some of that language on Language

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,920
Takeaway.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,160
So as we mentioned in the introduction to today's podcast, homeschooling is one of many

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,960
different educational options.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,560
The most common ones are, in the beginning of the dialogue, public and private school.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,800
So in most places you will have public schools where basically the education is paid for

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
by the government.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, that's right.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,360
So public schools are schools that are available to all students.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,680
You don't have to pay to attend them.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,000
This is of course in America.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,680
In Britain the system is a bit different.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,700
But in America you have the public schools which most kids go to.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Of course if your parents don't want you to study in public school there's another option

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,640
that's called private school.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
That's right.

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,120
Private school as the name says, it's not really private but what happens is that it's

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,600
not available free for everyone.

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,960
You have to actually pay to go to the school.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
That's right.

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,680
The school has a tuition, kind of like a private college or university.

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,160
So you have to pay every semester or every year.

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,040
And usually these schools also have application standards.

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,700
So they interview you, they interview your parents.

63
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,600
So there's a lot of different things you have to do to attend these schools.

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,280
So they're a bit more exclusive.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
That's right.

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,640
So these are basically some three options you have.

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,080
Homeschooling, public schools, private schools.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,920
And well the two parents are kind of discussing the options of why it would be maybe not a

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,880
good idea to homeschool one of the kids.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,080
And she says that it would be isolating our children from social interaction.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Alright.

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,200
So let's take a look at the word to isolate.

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,920
This is a verb.

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,220
And I like to think of island, isolate, kind of similar in a way.

75
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,840
Basically to isolate from is to keep away from.

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,600
So if your student or your child is being homeschooled, he or she might be isolated

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,920
from other students.

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,120
They're not near or with other students.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
That's right.

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,800
So to isolate means to keep away from or to keep separately.

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,440
So like you said, maybe if you're on an island, you are isolated from the rest of the world.

82
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
That's right.

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,920
I live in the country far away from the city.

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,600
I feel isolated from other people.

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,200
So she's saying that the kid might be isolated from social interaction.

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Alright.

87
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,840
Now, social interaction.

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,120
This is a two-word phrase.

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
We usually take it as a phrase.

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,720
This basically means talking to or playing with other people, other kids.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Right.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,960
So I guess in this case, it's personal or physical social interaction because nowadays

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,520
we have social interaction via the internet.

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
That's right.

95
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,520
But in the case of a student going to school, it would be of course playing on the playground,

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
attending class.

97
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
But social interaction means talking to or being with other people.

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
That's right.

99
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,400
Well, and the other parent argued that there are many advantages and specifically he said

100
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,120
that having a one-on-one class is better for the kids.

101
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,040
Alright, so this word one-on-one refers to one teacher, one student.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Right.

103
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,200
One parent, one child.

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,680
It means when you're talking to someone and there's no one else around.

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,240
Alright, so usually tutors teach you one-on-one.

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,920
You sit at a table and your tutor helps you study.

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,120
But in the case of homeschooling, the student learns one-on-one.

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,960
So learns directly from the teacher.

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,560
Right, and that's different from public schools obviously because you have one teacher for

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,200
maybe 30 students.

111
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
That's right.

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
So that's one-on-one.

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
That's one-on-many.

114
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Right, exactly.

115
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,600
But one-on-one is also a word you can use when you talk about meetings.

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,520
So you could say, hey Marco, can we have a one-on-one meeting later?

117
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,400
I'd like to talk to you alone.

118
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,920
So that means I'm not going to talk to you with other people around.

119
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,960
Right, okay, it's like a private meeting.

120
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Yeah.

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Very good.

122
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,520
So let's take a listen to the dialogue again and then we're going to come back and we're

123
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:06,960
going to take a look at some key phrases.

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,320
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

125
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
What?

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Why?

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,480
I have been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
Like what?

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,720
I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
interaction.

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,880
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,640
more relaxed and fun way.

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,600
I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,840
his or her strengths or weaknesses.

136
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

137
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

138
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,400
Good luck with that.

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,640
All right, we've picked out four key phrases for you today.

140
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,240
Let's take a look at those on Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,680
So the first phrase today in Fluency Builder is the phrase to read up on.

143
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,360
So the sentence was, I've been reading up on homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Right.

145
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,920
So basically if you say you have been reading up on a subject or a topic or something, it

146
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,880
means that you've been reading about it, you've kind of been informing yourself.

147
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,200
You're doing research about a topic.

148
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,840
So in this case, one parent is researching the homeschooling option.

149
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,200
So here she is reading maybe articles in a magazine or books or looking on the internet.

150
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,080
But you don't actually just have to read up on education.

151
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,880
You can read up on anything, right?

152
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Right.

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Exactly.

154
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,920
So you can read up on anything that interests you or you can do research on anything.

155
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,560
So you can read up on dinosaurs, for example.

156
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,720
I've been reading up on dinosaurs lately.

157
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,280
And did you know that the brontosaurus is not a real dinosaur anymore?

158
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
That's right.

159
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay, so we've been reading up on the advantages of homeschooling and he starts by, well, defending

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,000
his position on what the advantages are with the phrase.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
Well, first of all.

162
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
All right.

163
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,960
This is an important little phrase.

164
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,120
This is something you can use, like you say, Marco, when you're going to have an argument

165
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,360
or maybe a discussion about something and you want to tell your points, your side of

166
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,440
the argument.

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,960
And so first of all means I have a list, but this is my first point.

168
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Right.

169
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,320
So it's a nice little phrase to open up this list of things that you're going to say, right?

170
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
That's right.

171
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,680
So you should drink orange juice, Marco, because first of all, it tastes good, but second of

172
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,080
all, or, but also it's very good for your body.

173
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Right.

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,640
So first of all is the first main point.

175
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,600
So you can say second of all.

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,000
Can you go like third of all, fourth of all?

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Not really, right?

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You don't really say it.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,920
I guess you could, but.

180
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,600
So you go first of all, second of all, and then maybe just go and also.

181
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
Or lastly.

182
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,560
And then lastly to end it.

183
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Okay.

184
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Very good.

185
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,160
Now, one of the other points that he talked about, well, apart from the one-on-one class

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,640
was that the reason why a one-on-one class was better is because he could focus on his

187
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,120
or her strengths and or weaknesses.

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,280
All right.

189
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,160
So strengths or weaknesses or strengths and weaknesses.

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,360
This is a set phrase.

191
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,820
And it's important to remember that these two words are opposites.

192
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,680
So strengths, that's the things you're good at.

193
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
And weaknesses.

194
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,840
Things you're bad at.

195
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Things you're bad at.

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,600
And so, especially when you're studying in a school or you're homeschooling, it's important

197
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,640
that the teacher understands the strengths and weaknesses of the student.

198
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,480
Because something that you're really good at, maybe you should encourage and something

199
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,520
you're bad at, you should work harder at improving.

200
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
That's right.

201
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
So it's usually fixed phrase.

202
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,800
You'll even get it in job interviews.

203
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,520
Somebody will say, well, what do you think are your strengths and weaknesses?

204
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Right.

205
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,640
So remember that phrase, strengths and weaknesses.

206
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Okay.

207
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,480
And lastly, he said that, well, even though the idea is interesting, it might be difficult

208
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,320
to make the parents or the grandparents agree with him.

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,720
So he said he will bring it up over Sunday brunch.

210
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Okay.

211
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,280
I will bring it up.

212
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Bring it up.

213
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,420
Well, you're not actually holding something.

214
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,880
This means that you will mention it in conversation.

215
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,120
Mention the topic, right?

216
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
That's right.

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,660
So maybe grandma and grandpa don't think homeschooling is a good idea, but you will discuss it or

218
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,680
you will suggest it during Sunday brunch.

219
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
Right.

220
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,720
So if you want to discuss a topic, you usually say, I will bring it up with the president,

221
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
for example.

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
That's right.

223
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,640
You will talk about it with the president.

224
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,120
You can also say, please don't bring it up.

225
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Right.

226
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,160
So maybe you told a secret and you don't want the other person to know and you say, okay,

227
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
please Marco, don't bring it up.

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay.

229
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Very good.

230
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
All right.

231
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,880
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

232
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

233
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
What?

234
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Why?

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,360
Well, our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

236
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,400
I have been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

237
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Like what?

238
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,600
I think that by doing something like that, we would be isolating our children from social

239
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
interaction.

240
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,680
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a

241
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,560
more relaxed and fun way.

242
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,480
I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on

243
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,720
his or her strengths or weaknesses.

244
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,400
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

245
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,720
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

246
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,800
Good luck with that.

247
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay.

248
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,280
So homeschooling is a very interesting option.

249
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,080
I think it's very common, more common nowadays in Britain and North America.

250
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:57,840
But how do people that are homeschooled go to college if they didn't go to a high school?

251
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,080
Well, I believe that most people when they finish homeschooling will take some tests

252
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,640
to prove that they've actually learned the material that is required by the state.

253
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,720
Because, you know, in America, each state sets the educational standards.

254
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,900
And so it's important that you learn certain science and math skills.

255
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,920
And then once you take those tests, you would get your GED, your graduate diploma.

256
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,880
And that means that you've learned everything that a high school student should know.

257
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Right.

258
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,880
So it's interesting because it would seem a little bit strange to not want your kid

259
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
to go to school.

260
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,880
But at the same time, there are many reasons why parents don't want their kids to go to

261
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
school.

262
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,960
Like in this dialogue, maybe the schools are not really good or too expensive.

263
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,200
What do you think about homeschooling?

264
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
Would you send your kids to homeschool?

265
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,040
I don't think I would do homeschooling because I think it's really important for students

266
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,200
to or for children to learn how to get along with others and to learn to negotiate and

267
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,080
to learn to play and to also learn to respect their teachers because you have a different

268
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,280
relationship with your parents than you do your teachers.

269
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,280
And I think there's a lot of valuable social lessons you can learn at school.

270
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,760
But I do understand why a lot of people choose this option, especially if the schools in

271
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,980
their area are poor performing schools so that the students aren't learning enough.

272
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,440
Or if maybe they're not safe because some schools there's some bullying or there's some

273
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
violence.

274
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,400
And so for those reasons, I definitely understand the motivation to do homeschooling.

275
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,560
But then again, you can't.

276
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,040
I mean, you can get homeschooled from kindergarten all the way through high school, right?

277
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,880
But there is no homeschooling for university unless you do like an online degree or something

278
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
like that.

279
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
You can't really be homeschooled for college.

280
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,160
No, there's distance courses so you could use the internet and learn online.

281
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,920
But no, you can't homeschool for university.

282
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,240
It's a very debatable topic.

283
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,000
A lot of people defend it saying it's good.

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,480
It brings parents closer together to their kids, that kids enjoy learning, that they

285
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
learn better, etc.

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Other people don't really agree with it.

287
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
So what is your opinion?

288
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
Do you agree with homeschooling?
