00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,720
My name is Catherine and today we're looking for a new job.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,200
That's right, we are looking for a new job and so we're bringing you this great lesson

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
where we're going to teach you in English a lot of terms related with looking for a

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,760
job or things like a resume, cover letter.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,260
So before we get into that, why don't we take a look at a word that we have in Vocabulary

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,680
Preview.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,440
Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,880
So this is actually the name of a job.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
It's a position.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,320
It's a gas station attendant.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,100
Okay, a gas station attendant.

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,920
Now we know what a gas station is, right?

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
That's right.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,080
It's a place where you go to fill your car with gas.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Okay.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,880
So an attendant at a gas station, what does he do?

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,320
He or she is a person who will help you put the gas in your car.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,840
So an attendant is someone who is almost like an assistant or a helper.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,040
You can have a bathroom attendant, someone who gives you a towel after you wash your

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
hands.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
I've seen those in the fancy restaurants.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,680
Yeah, so gas station attendant.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
Alright, so why don't we take a look now at our dialogue.

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,480
Let's listen to it for the first time and we'll be back in a bit.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,920
Woohoo!

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,680
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
What happened?

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm in the market for a job.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,640
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,480
I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,720
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,200
of cake to write.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,760
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
personally.

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,640
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

38
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Goodbye my penniless days, hello salary and a career.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,560
Ben, we're 15.

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,600
What kind of job are you looking for?

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,240
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,080
You know, starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
in the world.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Uh huh.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,920
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,240
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline.

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Don't you?

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,760
Alright, we're back.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,400
So now you're probably wondering what those words meant.

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,480
So why don't we take a look at a couple of them in Language Takeaway.

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,680
The first phrase we have today is one that's very important when you're looking for a job.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,840
It's called job listing or job listings here.

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Okay, job listings.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,320
And this is really common before the internet existed.

57
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,480
You would have the listings in your local newspaper, right?

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Exactly.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,320
In the movies, you always had the person sitting with the newspaper circling the potential

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
jobs.

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Right, with a red marker.

62
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Exactly.

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,400
But now that we have the internet, you have lots of websites that have job listings.

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,080
And so a job listing is literally a list of jobs that are available.

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Okay.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,560
So you look through the job listings.

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,080
Maybe you found one that's interesting.

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
There's an email address.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
So what do they ask for?

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,960
They ask you to send in your resume.

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Okay.

72
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,520
A resume is very important when you're looking for a job.

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,160
It's a document.

74
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a piece of paper that tells someone all of the work that you've done before, your

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,800
job experiences, and it tells them where you went to school and what your qualifications

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
are.

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,840
So it's a summary of your work life.

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Okay.

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
And that's why it's called a resume, right?

80
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,360
It's pretty much a summary of your work life, as you say.

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
That's right.

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,240
And a different one, sometimes people use this, is a CV, curriculum vitae, and that's

83
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,860
an academic summary of your life.

84
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,320
So you have the work summary and the study summary.

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Okay.

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Very good.

87
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,080
So if you send in your resume, what's recommended is that you attach it with a cover letter.

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay.

89
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,320
Well, cover letter, you know the word letter.

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,680
It's something that you write to somebody else.

91
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,840
But a cover letter is like a cover for your resume.

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,480
It's a letter where you explain to the future boss or future employer what exactly you want

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,400
and how this job is going to help you get it.

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Okay.

95
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,920
So that's basically a small little introduction to yourself, right?

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,440
Before they read your resume, who you are, what you're looking for, maybe very quickly.

97
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Exactly.

98
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
So you can say, Hi, my name is Catherine.

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm very motivated and excited to have the opportunity to talk to you about why I'm a

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,720
skilled employee and why I will benefit your company.

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Very good.

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
All right.

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,800
So you've sent in your resume and your cover letter.

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,200
And well, maybe you're looking to get into a career as a gas station attendant.

105
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,040
So what's the difference between job and career?

106
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Okay.

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,320
And this is very interesting because in many languages, there is a similar word, which

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
for example, in Spanish is carrera, right?

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,880
And that means like a profession.

110
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,920
So many people translate it literally as career, but it's not the right word.

111
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,720
What is a career?

112
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,040
A career I think of as a long term goal.

113
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,820
A career is your profession.

114
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,240
It's the name you give yourself.

115
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,000
But a job is a position in a company from one time to another.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So for example, my job here is host of EnglishPod.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,400
But maybe in the future, I will have a media career.

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,320
That means that my job or jobs will have to do with this profession.

119
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,880
It's kind of a bigger thing, a longer thing.

120
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
So maybe you can think of it this way.

121
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,920
A career is like, as you say, bigger picture, like the macro category, right?

122
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,000
You're into media and television, for example.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,760
And your job specifically is a podcast host.

124
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,440
But in the future, maybe I want to have a different job in this career and move into

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,900
production and be a TV producer.

126
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,080
So that's a part of my career path.

127
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,120
I can move forward.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,000
So career is very important word.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,360
So we've taken a look at a couple of great words.

131
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

132
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,480
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the

133
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
letters personally.

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,720
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Goodbye my penniless days.

136
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,680
Hello salary and a career.

137
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Ben, we're 15.

138
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,560
What kind of job are you looking for?

139
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

140
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,640
You know, starting at a simple lowly job, just like all the greats before they made

141
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,440
it big in the world.

142
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,040
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

144
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,280
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline.

145
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
Don't you?

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,920
All right.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,880
We're back.

148
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,000
So now we have lined up for you three key phrases that we found in this dialogue.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,520
So let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

150
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
Fluency Builder.

151
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
This first one's a great phrase.

152
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,840
It's going to make you sound very fluent in English if you use it.

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,160
We say in the market for.

154
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm in the market for a new job.

155
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
All right.

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,320
So this person is looking for a new job.

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,480
He is in the market for.

158
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,840
I could also say, I'm in the market for a new house.

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
Marco, do you know any good real estate agents?

160
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,080
So what does that mean if you say I'm in the market for a new job or you're in the market

161
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,200
for a new house?

162
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,040
I am right now actively looking for this thing.

163
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,320
I really want one.

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You're available.

165
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Yes.

166
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Okay.

167
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,440
So I'm in the market for a new job.

168
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm in the market for a new car.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,520
It means the market is the marketplace.

170
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,040
Right, right.

171
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,120
And this sometimes you could see it related in movies.

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,200
For example, they say if a person gets married, they are no longer in the market.

173
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,680
I'm in the market for a husband.

174
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Right.

175
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Do you know any nice guys?

176
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
All right.

177
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,440
So you're in the market.

178
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
You're looking for a job.

179
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,920
And well, if you're qualified, it will be a piece of cake to find a new job.

180
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,440
Isn't this a delicious phrase?

181
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,720
So piece of cake, you think what does cake have to do with anything?

182
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,760
Well, cake, this is a way to say something is easy.

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,440
Okay, so it's really easy.

184
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,720
This often happens in our office actually, because you and I understand computers, but

185
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,040
we work with someone who has a hard time with computers.

186
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,480
And she's like, oh, it doesn't work.

187
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
And we're like, it's a piece of cake.

188
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
It's a piece of cake.

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
It's so easy.

190
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,360
Why is this hard?

191
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,080
So a piece of cake is a way to say something simple.

192
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,400
And it's a very, very, very common phrase.

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
You'll hear it all the time.

194
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,360
A piece of cake, don't worry about it.

195
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Piece of cake.

196
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Hey, can you help me out with this thing?

197
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,040
Sure, it's a piece of cake.

198
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,520
All right.

199
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,320
And for our last phrase, he was talking about his position as a gas attendant.

200
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,560
And he said, well, you know, all the greats, all the famous people, they started somewhere

201
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,280
before they made it big.

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,720
What does he mean with they made it big?

203
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Well, the phrase to make it big or in here in the past tense, made it big, means to be

204
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,960
successful.

205
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,600
So we're talking about, for example, Albert Einstein.

206
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,720
Albert Einstein worked in the patent office in a clue.

207
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,000
He was a clerk in Europe.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,280
And you know, that's not a very impressive job, but it was a job.

209
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,800
And he made it big later on as a physicist.

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,000
And so to make it big is to succeed, to become famous or successful or important.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Right.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
Or sometimes people say, yeah, I made it.

213
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,520
I made it big or I made it in my life.

214
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,000
And that means that you were successful.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Or this product is going to make it big.

216
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,920
It's going to be really successful.

217
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,080
Yeah, that's good.

218
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Okay.

219
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,400
So it's a key phrase to make it or to make it big.

220
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a little bit.

221
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,640
Woohoo!

222
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,880
This just might be the start of the rest of my life.

223
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,040
What happened?

224
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,240
I'm in the market for a job.

225
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,840
I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until

226
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,680
I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for.

227
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,920
I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece

228
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,400
of cake to write.

229
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,040
I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters

230
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
personally.

231
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,840
And you know, I can be charming in interviews.

232
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,640
Goodbye my penniless days.

233
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,840
Hello salary and a career.

234
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,760
Ben, we're 15.

235
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
What kind of job are you looking for?

236
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,440
Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

237
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,280
You know, starting at a simple lowly job just like all the greats before they made it big

238
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
in the world.

239
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
Uh huh.

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,280
But I'm just in it for the money, right?

241
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,400
How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies?

242
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,440
Besides, I love the smell of gasoline.

243
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Don't you?

244
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:32,520
All right, so talking about jobs, now I noticed something that in the United States, unlike

245
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,560
many other countries, there are no gas station attendants anymore.

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
There are.

247
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Touche.

248
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,280
There are actually a lot of gas station attendants in New Jersey because it's the law that you

249
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,000
cannot pump your own gas.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,640
You cannot put gas in your own car.

251
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Why is that?

252
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,560
It's a way for the New Jersey government to increase the amount of jobs in the states.

253
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,800
So to create jobs, they made gas station attendants.

254
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Oh wow.

255
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
Yeah, I've noticed in some states, for example, you just go up to the pump and if you have

256
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,280
your credit card, you put in your credit card and you pump your own gas.

257
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,840
And apparently it also has to do with health issues because people who are working in gas

258
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,200
stations tend to have serious health problems later on.

259
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,400
I mean, you're inhaling all these gases from the gasoline.

260
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
That's right.

261
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
It's very unhealthy.

262
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,920
And I think that's also very dangerous in some places because gas stations are often

263
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,200
robbed because there's only one person and no security sometimes.

264
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,520
So there are some negative parts of being a gas station attendant.

265
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,080
But if it's a job and you need a job, it's probably a good one.

266
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Yeah, no, true.

267
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,280
I actually, I remember seeing Back to the Future when in the 50s, you would pull up

268
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,040
to a gas station, somebody would check your tire pressure, they would check your oil and

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,480
they would clean your windows and it's just like full service when you pulled up to a

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
gas station.

271
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
They might even buy you a beer.

272
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,160
Alright, so it's really interesting about these positions.

273
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,760
I imagine that in other places, some job positions that maybe we would find a little bit strange

274
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
or uncommon.

275
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Absolutely.

276
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,800
And I encourage everyone today, this is your homework, tell us on EnglishPod.com what is

277
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,600
your job and what's your career.

278
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
What's your job and what's your career.

279
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,080
So what's the career you would like to have in the future.

280
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Very good.

281
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Alright, so we'll see you guys there.

282
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
