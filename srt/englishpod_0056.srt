00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,640
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,320
And today we're going to be bringing you a great lesson that's talking about a bank

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
robbery.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, and this is an important lesson for all of our future bank robbers out there.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,120
Yeah, we are going to teach you some words that you would use for planning a bank robbery,

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,880
but you can apply them to other situations, hopefully not.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,240
Yeah, I hope you apply them to other situations.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Hopefully you won't rob a bank.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,560
We don't want to be responsible for any crimes you can commit.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Yes.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,520
Alright, so why don't we start by looking at some of the vocabulary in Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,880
Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,120
We have one word for you today that you'll hear in the dialogue and it is filling in.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Filling in.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,560
Filling in.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,880
So to fill in for somebody, right?

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Yes.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,440
That means that you are replacing them.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Yes.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,840
So if Marco can't host the show today, maybe Dany will fill in.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay, so to take the place of someone.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Exactly.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Alright.

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,280
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,760
Let's listen to this bank robbery and let's see what happens.

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:27,320
Alright, so this is what we're going to do.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,960
I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go to the bank wearing these uniforms.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Got it.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,440
No problem, boss.

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,240
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,880
on another route today.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
Don't lose your cool.

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Just act natural.

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,960
What if they want to call and confirm?

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
You let them.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
What?

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Don't worry.

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
We have the phones tapped, so the call will be passed through to me and I'll pretend to

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
be the transport company.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
You're so clever, boss.

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,200
Okay, shut up.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,280
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Don't get greedy.

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Are you ready?

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Let's go.

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,720
Well, it sounds like a pretty interesting plan.

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
It does sound like a plan.

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
Do you think it'll work?

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
I don't know.

54
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,120
I guess we'll have to maybe talk a little bit about that later.

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay.

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Yeah.

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,560
Let's take a look at the language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,720
Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,500
Okay, we heard five really great words in this dialogue that I'd like to look at now

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,080
in Language Takeaway.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
So let's go to the first one.

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Now we heard the boss say that they got replicas of the uniforms.

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
Right, replicas.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Replicas.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Replicas.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Replicas.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,840
So this is really easy.

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,960
Something that's a replica is a copy.

69
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Exactly.

70
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Right?

71
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,520
So for example, in Las Vegas, there's a replica of the Eiffel Tower of Paris.

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Yes.

73
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,600
Actually, I lived in a small city where there was also a replica of the Eiffel Tower.

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Really?

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Yeah, in France.

76
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
That is kind of weird.

77
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Well, there are a lot of replicas.

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,480
Even now on the street, maybe you can see replica watches, right?

79
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,600
That supposedly are Rolex, but they're not.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,880
And many, many other things.

81
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
So, copies.

82
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Yes.

83
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Not the real thing.

84
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Not the real thing.

85
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,960
All right, so let's take a look at the next word.

86
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Tapped.

87
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,520
We have the phones tapped.

88
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,680
We have the phones tapped.

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,760
Tapped.

90
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,640
So if you tap someone's phone, you do something to the telephone line so that you can hear

91
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,160
their conversations, right?

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Right.

93
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,040
And actually, the police do this sometimes, right?

94
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Right.

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
You see it in movies all the time.

96
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
You connect a wire to the phone so you can listen to the conversation.

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Exactly.

99
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,960
So, you tap the telephone line.

100
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,040
So in our dialogue, they tapped the bank's phone, right?

101
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,360
And he said if they make a call, he will patch the call through to him.

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Yes.

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Right?

104
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
So, patch through.

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Patch through.

106
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Yeah, patch a call through.

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Patch through.

108
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
And we use this today.

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Yeah.

110
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Like if you call an office, right?

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
And you say, oh, can you patch me through to Carol?

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Yes.

113
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Right?

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
So, can you connect me to another phone line?

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Connect me.

116
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah.

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Right.

118
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
All right.

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Now, let's take a look at our next words.

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Clever.

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Yes, the boss is very clever.

122
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
The boss is very clever.

123
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,960
All right.

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,760
So if you're clever, you're...

125
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
You're smart.

126
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Yeah.

127
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
You're really smart.

128
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah.

129
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Right.

130
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,960
So, you're clever and this is a clever plan.

131
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Clever plan.

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Exactly.

133
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,680
Now, let's take a look at our last word.

134
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Don't be greedy.

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Greedy.

136
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Greedy.

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Greedy.

138
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
To be greedy is a bad thing.

139
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Right.

140
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
You want everything.

141
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
You want everything for you.

142
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Yes.

143
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
You don't share.

144
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Yes.

145
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,880
So, like at lunch today, when you had that cake.

146
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
And I didn't share?

147
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah.

148
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I was very greedy?

149
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Uh-huh.

150
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Yes.

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,840
With food, I am greedy.

152
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
All right.

153
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
So, these are some great words.

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,960
And I think, you know, if we listen to the dialogue another time, a little bit more slowly,

155
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,960
we'll be able to hear them a little bit better.

156
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,480
All right.

157
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,600
So this is what we're going to do.

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
I've carefully mapped this out.

159
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
So don't screw it up.

160
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,680
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms.

161
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear when they pick up the money.

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,760
Got it.

163
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,960
No problem, boss.

164
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,400
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're

165
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,480
on another route today.

166
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,400
Don't lose your cool.

167
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,640
Just act natural.

168
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,000
What if they want to call and conform?

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
You let them.

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
What?

171
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
Don't worry.

172
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
We have the phones tapped.

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,880
So the call will be patched through to me.

174
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,400
And I'll pretend to be the transport company.

175
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,640
You're so clever, boss.

176
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,200
Okay, shut up.

177
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Only take as much money as you can fit into these bags.

178
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,720
Don't get greedy.

179
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,960
Are you ready?

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,240
Let's go.

181
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,480
Okay, so now we understand these words that we talked about in Language Takeaway.

182
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,120
So now let's take a look at some of these great phrases in Fluency Builder.

183
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Fluency Builder.

184
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,880
We've got three phrases for you here.

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,180
And these are all phrases you might use when you're planning something.

186
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,200
So the first one, mapped out.

187
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,320
I've carefully mapped this out.

188
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Mapped out.

189
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
To map out.

190
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,800
So when you map something out, what do you do?

191
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,560
Well, you literally create a plan.

192
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,280
You draw a map of what you're going to do.

193
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,480
So here, is it only for like travel or?

194
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
No, no, no.

195
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,800
It's like, for example, if we're starting a new project in the company, you can map

196
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,200
out the project, what you're going to do this month, next month.

197
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,240
So it's a plan.

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,200
So you draw every step in the plan.

199
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,440
Every step, right.

200
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,000
So you said, well, I've mapped out this plan for a new project.

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
Okay, interesting word.

202
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,040
I think we should hear some examples of how it's used.

203
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,960
Example one.

204
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,760
So I have the future all mapped out.

205
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,680
Well, you'll get a job as a waiter, then we'll get married.

206
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,640
And two years later, we'll start having kids.

207
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,440
Example two.

208
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,480
We're mapping out the marketing plan at the meeting today.

209
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,040
Example three.

210
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:04,160
Okay, I've mapped out our trip and it should take about 10 hours.

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
All right, so mapped out.

212
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Really, really clear now.

213
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,520
Let's take a look at our next word.

214
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
All right, so if you've mapped out a plan, you don't want to screw it up.

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,280
Right, screw it up.

216
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Screw it up.

217
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,760
Or screw up.

218
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Yep.

219
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
So to screw something up means that you made a mistake on something.

220
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Or you did something wrong.

221
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
You did it wrong.

222
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Yep.

223
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,520
Okay, so for example, if I'm taking an exam and I make a mistake, I screwed up on the

224
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
exam.

225
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Exactly.

226
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,960
Or for example, here, when we're recording, Marco and I make mistakes a lot.

227
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,160
Maybe more me than Marco.

228
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,960
We always screw up.

229
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Yeah.

230
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Exactly.

231
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,720
So to make a mistake, it's a really informal word, but very, very common.

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah.

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
And you know, it sounds really, really natural when people use this.

234
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,200
All right, so now let's take a look at our last word.

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
Lose your cool.

236
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,520
Lose your cool.

237
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,240
Don't lose your cool.

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
So what is this, to lose your cool?

239
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
It's a weird expression.

240
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,360
It's a weird expression.

241
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,280
Why don't we just give you an example of a person that loses his or her cool.

242
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,640
What do you mean you're not ready to go?

243
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
It's time to go.

244
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
We have to go now.

245
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Boninato!

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
We were supposed to leave!

247
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Punietta, now we're sitting here again.

248
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm going to wait for you.

249
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Boninam!

250
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,160
Okay, so basically, you lose your temper.

251
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,920
You become irritated.

252
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,720
You lose control of your emotions.

253
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Right.

254
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,720
So Marco, when you lose your cool, is it always that you get angry?

255
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,260
You don't always get angry.

256
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,760
Maybe you get irritated or impatient.

257
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Or even nervous.

258
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Nervous.

259
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah.

260
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Right?

261
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
So basically, you're not in control of your emotions.

262
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Yeah.

263
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,120
Okay, so we've looked at a lot of great phrases, a lot of great words.

264
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,640
So we can listen to our dialogue now for the third time, and then we'll come back and talk

265
00:09:49,640 --> 00:10:03,640
about this bank robbery business.

266
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,080
All right, so this is what we're going to do.

267
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,720
I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.

268
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go to the bank wearing these uniforms.

269
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,480
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

270
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,520
Got it.

271
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,240
No problem, boss.

272
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,880
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom, and say that

273
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
they're on another route today.

274
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
Don't lose your cool.

275
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Just act natural.

276
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
What if they want to call and confirm?

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
You let them.

278
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
What?

279
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Don't worry.

280
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,360
We have the phones tapped, so the call will be patched through to me, and I'll pretend

281
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
to be the transport company.

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
You're so clever, boss.

283
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Okay, shut up.

284
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,080
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

285
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Don't get greedy.

286
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Are you ready?

287
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Let's go.

288
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:57,400
So there's a lot of movies about bank robberies, but obviously they happen in real life.

289
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,720
So this dialogue is actually based on real events, right?

290
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,680
Yeah, this actually happened in real life, and so it's actually a very creative and nonviolent

291
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,760
way of robbing a bank.

292
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,640
Okay, so what happened?

293
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,360
Basically, this guy went to a bank dressed up as one of those security guards that transport

294
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,000
the money from the bank to another safe place.

295
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,680
He had fake credentials or replica credentials.

296
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
So fake ID.

297
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Yeah, he had a replica of the uniform.

298
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,960
And he walked in, he took all these bags, him and his partner, and they took him to

299
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
the truck and drove off.

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
The bank didn't realize that they had been robbed.

301
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,480
They thought it was a routine thing.

302
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,800
Three or four hours later, the real security guard shows up.

303
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,600
They were long gone, and they still can't find them.

304
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Really?

305
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,580
So a very clever plan.

306
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,840
Very clever and very effective.

307
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,040
I think they stole over half a million dollars.

308
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Okay, well guys, don't try this at home.

309
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Don't try this at home, but real life, real English, right?

310
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Exactly.

311
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,640
Okay, so come to our website, leave your questions and comments.

312
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
Tell us what you think will happen with these guys.

313
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,960
Do you think they'll be successful?

314
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,120
Do you think they'll get caught?

315
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,160
Yeah, they might end up in jail.

316
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Maybe somebody will lose their cool and get caught, right?

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,040
Well thanks for listening guys, and until next time, goodbye.
