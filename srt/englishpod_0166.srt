00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,440
My name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,200
And today we have an intermediate level lesson talking about appearances.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
That's right.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,680
We are going to change or somebody wants to change their appearance and they're going

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,480
to have surgery.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Well, before we get started, let's look at what kind of surgery they're having in today's

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,520
vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
All right.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,320
So today we're going to be talking about plastic surgery specifically.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Plastic surgery.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,720
So why plastic?

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
I have no idea.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
I don't either.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
No.

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,440
Well, basically, plastic surgery is, you know, surgery for your appearance, right?

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,920
It's not really for health reasons.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
That's right.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,340
And sometimes they add things to you.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,480
Sometimes they take things away, but they're not for your health.

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,160
They're not for your heart or your lungs.

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Right.

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
It's for your appearance.

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,240
Yeah. and also called cosmetic surgery.

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
That's right.

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
And we'll be hearing that later.

30
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,480
But cosmetic means having to do with your appearance like cosmetics.

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Right.

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
Exactly.

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
All right.

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
So we're going to be talking about this.

35
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:18,440
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back.

36
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
What are you doing?

37
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
Look at me.

38
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,720
I look so old.

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,800
I look as if I were 30.

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Come on.

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Stop being so vain.

42
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,320
You look great.

43
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
You are beautiful.

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,960
Yes, I am.

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,120
But I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

46
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
See?

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,560
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,960
You're 25.

50
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Stop being ridiculous.

51
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Besides, I think that people who get Botox have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

52
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Doesn't look natural.

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Whatever.

54
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,720
I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

55
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,240
I think you need to get brain surgery.

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,320
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

57
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
You look amazing.

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,440
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

59
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,240
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

60
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,440
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

61
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,800
You're fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you.

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,920
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Really?

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Yeah.

65
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,920
I got my nose job, I was black and blue for a week.

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
Alright, we're back.

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,160
So yeah, they think this girl really wants to get this surgery.

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,200
But she doesn't seem to know why.

69
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,440
She's just like, I'm in a bad mood.

70
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I want surgery.

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
And that's the worst reason.

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
And it's pretty painful from what I hear.

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
Expensive and painful and potentially dangerous.

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Yeah, exactly.

75
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
But we can talk about that at the end.

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Alright.

77
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,040
So why don't we start with the words that we saw that are all related to surgery in

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,680
Language Takeaway.

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Language Takeaway.

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Okay, well this first one might be the reason for surgery, not necessarily a kind of surgery.

81
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
If someone is vain.

82
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,040
Okay, so if a person is vain, this is an adjective.

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,000
That means that they are very, they care too much about their appearance, right?

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Right.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
And they care so much that they only care about themselves.

86
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
So do I look good?

87
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,440
I love my face, my eyes.

88
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I look so good.

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,400
So a person who is vain thinks very highly of themselves.

90
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Okay, very good.

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,200
And well, this person I think wanted to get surgery as well because she said she had wrinkles.

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,520
Okay, wrinkles are little lines on your face.

93
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
So maybe on your forehead or next to your mouth.

94
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,000
And generally, when we get older, people get more and more of these.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,200
And you have, even you have wrinkly skin when you're in the bathtub for too long and you

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,240
look in your hands, they look like raisins.

98
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
You have wrinkly skin.

99
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
That's right.

100
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Wrinkles are little lines in your skin.

101
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
All right.

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
And well, you have wrinkles as you said around your mouth and eyes.

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
And sometimes under your eyes, you also have some sagging skin.

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Or under your chin.

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,360
Under your chin as well, yeah.

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
That's right.

107
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,960
So sagging means coming down, means it's heavy.

108
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
It's like hanging.

109
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Yeah.

110
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Right.

111
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,520
So sagging, something sags.

112
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,040
It's heavy, it pulls down.

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,640
But if you have sagging skin, that means your skin is no longer tight.

114
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,280
It's kind of loose and it hangs.

115
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Falling off your face.

116
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Okay.

117
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,920
And well, a new popular treatment that is not really surgery is this Botox.

118
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
That's right.

119
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,520
So Botox is something that women and some men do every couple of months I think and

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
they have to get shots.

121
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Right.

122
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
They're like injections.

123
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
That's right.

124
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,620
And they tighten your skin.

125
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,280
And so you can get Botox in your face, your forehead or your eyes and it makes you look

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,840
younger for a couple of months.

127
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I've heard that they also put them in their lips to make them like fuller, right?

128
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,920
That's right.

129
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,680
And sometimes you can say that someone's had too much Botox because they can no longer

130
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,320
smile or they can't stop smiling.

131
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
Exactly.

132
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,040
And well, very related to this is also when people get a facelift.

133
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Okay.

134
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
A facelift.

135
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,880
So basically it's that a doctor, a plastic surgeon will tighten the skin on your face

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,720
so he'll pull your eyes and the skin next to your ears to make your face look younger.

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Right.

138
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
So that's called a facelift.

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,560
So it's to kind of take away those wrinkles, right?

140
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Or the sagging skin.

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Right.

142
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Lift means to pull up.

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Right.

144
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
It's the opposite of sag.

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Very good.

146
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Alright.

147
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,320
So this dialogue has a lot of rich vocabulary related to surgery.

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,640
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back with the second part of

149
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:51,120
language takeaway to explain a little bit more.

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
What are you doing?

151
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Look at me.

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
I look so old.

153
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,480
I look as if I were 30.

154
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Come on.

155
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Stop being so vain.

156
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
You look great.

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You are beautiful.

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
Yes, I am.

159
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,800
But I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.

161
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,320
See?

162
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,240
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

163
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,640
You're 25.

164
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Stop being ridiculous.

165
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,360
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

166
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
It doesn't look natural.

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Whatever.

168
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,400
I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

169
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
I think you need to get brain surgery.

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,040
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

171
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
You look amazing.

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,120
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

173
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,920
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

174
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,120
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,080
You're fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you.

176
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,600
Plastic surgery hurts.

177
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Really?

178
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Yeah.

179
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,080
When I got my nose job, I was black and blue for a week.

180
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,320
All right, we're back.

181
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,680
So what other surgical procedure is in store for us?

182
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,760
Well now the big ones.

183
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,800
So we've left the face and we're talking about the rest of the body.

184
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
The first one is a tummy tuck.

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,920
Okay, so a tummy tuck.

186
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
What is that exactly?

187
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,080
Well, let's look at these two words by themselves because maybe tummy, people have heard before.

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
This is another way to say stomach.

189
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
Usually children say tummy.

190
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,880
Right, my tummy hurts.

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,320
My tummy hurts and doctors, they'll say stomach.

192
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,600
But the name of this surgery is tummy tuck because tuck means to put in or to fold.

193
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,920
And so my mom used to say tuck in your shirt.

194
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,800
You know when your shirt comes out of your pants and that means you put it back in.

195
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,640
Well a tuck means to fold your stomach under.

196
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,440
It means to make your stomach look smaller and they put staples or I think they sew you

197
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
up.

198
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Yeah, they sew you up.

199
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
It's pretty painful, right?

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I've heard that.

201
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,920
Usually this is because somebody got a liposuction for example and that's our next word, liposuction.

202
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,880
Okay, lipo, that's kind of fat, right?

203
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Yeah.

204
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
And suction means to pull like a vacuum.

205
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Right.

206
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,360
So that's basically what they do.

207
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,600
They open the person up and kind of use a sort of vacuum type device and suck all the

208
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,400
fat out of the stomach or the balcony areas, you know, the love handles that are also called.

209
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,960
And this way, they remove all this excess fat.

210
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,520
And because they do this, sometimes the skin, since it's been stretched out because you

211
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,160
were a little bit fat, they need to have a tummy tuck.

212
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,040
That means to hide the extra skin.

213
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,480
The extra skin to kind of hide it.

214
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,480
So these two words, these two procedures actually go hand in hand because maybe if you're very

215
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,320
fat you get a liposuction but that doesn't solve your problem because now you have all

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
this sagging skin off your stomach.

217
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
That's right.

218
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,200
So you have to have a tummy tuck as well.

219
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Alright.

220
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,240
So yeah, very, very dangerous procedure I've heard as well, right?

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Yeah.

222
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,520
And they usually only do it with people who are very, very fat.

223
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,300
That means dangerously fat.

224
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,880
Because if you do it on a skinny person, you could really hurt them.

225
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,800
Yeah, of course, fat is also necessary for our bodies.

226
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,480
Alright, so now moving back up to the face again, a very common procedure, I think one

227
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,960
of the most common ones is a nose job.

228
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,620
A nose job.

229
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,200
And so nose job is very colloquial.

230
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,080
You'll hear this on the TV.

231
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Nose job means to fix someone's nose, to change the shape or appearance of their nose.

232
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,960
And so oftentimes people with really big noses want smaller noses.

233
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,000
And so the doctor will take some bone away and will put the skin back.

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,280
Yes, that's right.

235
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,400
So this is called a nose job or formerly known as like a nose surgery, right?

236
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
That's right.

237
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,160
Rhinoplasty is the official name.

238
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,160
And actually I've heard it's very painful because they have to break your nose before

239
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
they fix it.

240
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Exactly.

241
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Wow.

242
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I can't believe people do this.

243
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,480
And well, one of the very common ones among women most likely is our breast implants.

244
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
That's right.

245
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,440
So breast implants, am I allowed to say boob job?

246
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
Yeah, you can.

247
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,520
Well, the very common phrase for this is boob job.

248
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,280
Boob is a very colloquial term for breasts.

249
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,640
And breast implants are, well, an implant is something that you put inside something.

250
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Okay.

251
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,360
And so a breast implant is a piece of silicone.

252
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,880
So it's like plastic, but it's more like a liquid plastic.

253
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Yeah.

254
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,560
Just imagine like this big plastic bag with like gel, right?

255
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Inside of it.

256
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,960
And they put that inside a woman's chest to make her breasts bigger.

257
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,120
And so these are very, very popular surgeries, breast implants.

258
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Right.

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Exactly.

260
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,480
I guess many models and many types, different types of women get breast implants.

261
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
That's right.

262
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,900
And the verb there is to get.

263
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,120
So she got breast implants.

264
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Right.

265
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Okay.

266
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Because they're things.

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Very good.

268
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
All right.

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a

270
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,880
little bit more.

271
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
What are you doing?

272
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Look at me.

273
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,160
I look so old.

274
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,240
I look as if I were 30.

275
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Come on.

276
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,480
Stop being so vain.

277
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,760
You look great.

278
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
You are beautiful.

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,400
Yes, I am.

280
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,580
But I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

281
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.

282
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
See?

283
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
You're 25.

285
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Stop being ridiculous.

286
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,120
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

287
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,800
It doesn't look natural.

288
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Whatever.

289
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,160
I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

290
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,680
I think you need to get brain surgery.

291
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,780
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

292
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,360
You look amazing.

293
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,900
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

294
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,720
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

295
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,880
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

296
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,240
You're fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you.

297
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

298
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Really?

299
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Yeah.

300
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,480
When I got my nose job, I was black and blue for a week.

301
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,680
All right, we're back.

302
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:18,440
So, as you mentioned, all of these surgeries are very painful and very expensive, right?

303
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
They are.

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,200
The plastic surgery industry is huge.

305
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,560
I was just reading an article that said that re-dos are becoming very popular.

306
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,760
There are doctors who perform re-dos.

307
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
That means-

308
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
To re-do a surgery.

309
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
That's right.

310
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,160
They're fixing other surgeries because oftentimes people go in, they say, I want a nose job,

311
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,680
they get a nose job, and then it's not the nose they wanted.

312
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,920
They have doctors now who specialize in fixing former surgeries.

313
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Wow.

314
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,720
I've heard also a lot about the plastic surgery tourism industry where people get offered

315
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,600
a package, for example, to go to countries like Argentina where they have good doctors

316
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,480
and it's very inexpensive compared to the states to get plastic surgery.

317
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,080
It's also popular now in Asia, I believe they're traveling to Hong Kong to get plastic surgery

318
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
done.

319
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Interesting.

320
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah, I know.

321
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,920
But it's one of those things that if you have the money and you really feel that you want

322
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,160
to improve your appearance, then-

323
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
But is it an improvement?

324
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
I don't know.

325
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
It is.

326
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
It's a little fake.

327
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Yeah, it is a little bit fake.

328
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,480
Like, for example, but it does help people with their self-confidence, right?

329
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,520
Sometimes, for example, with the case of breast implants, some women feel very, very self-conscious

330
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,040
about them having smaller breasts.

331
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,920
They want to get bigger breasts and they feel more confident, happier, and stuff like this.

332
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,560
I guess if it helps and if you really want it, everyone's to their own.

333
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,280
Well, I'm curious what our users think about this.

334
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,640
Have you had plastic surgery?

335
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
Would you like to have plastic surgery?

336
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

337
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Right.

338
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
We'll see you guys there.

339
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Until next time.

340
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Bye.

341
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:13,240
Thank you.
