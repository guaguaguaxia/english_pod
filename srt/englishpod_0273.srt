00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Catherine and we're talking about the stars today.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,320
That's right. Today we're going to talk about a very popular subject. Many people believe

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,320
in the horoscope.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,320
So a horoscope is basically a system, a very old system of determining your future and

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,560
describing your personality. And so it all depends on when you were born and where you

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,800
were born. So what stars were in the sky when you were born.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,800
That's right. So basically, as many of you may know, there are 12 signs and we're going

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,120
to talk about a couple of them and a little bit more about horoscopes and this, I don't

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,920
know, I guess it's kind of like a branch of science or...

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Pseudo-science.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Pseudo-science.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,880
Yeah, I don't think there's much testing that's going on, but it's definitely something that

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,400
a lot of people believe in. So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,400
back in a moment to talk more about it.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,520
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month. My outlook is very positive. It says that

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,840
I should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,460
What are you talking about? Let me see that. What are horoscopes?

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,720
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,560
the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries. When

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
were you born?

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,080
January 5th.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,400
Let's see. You're a Capricorn. It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,160
could see new exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
summers.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,120
That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically non-existent.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,040
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,440
No it's not. Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See, it

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,120
says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,360
Well you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,840
What does it say about me?

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,440
A Capricorn is serious minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,440
That sounds just like you!

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,280
Alright we're back. So a very interesting dialogue between these two girls talking about

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
one of them believing in the horoscope and the other one doesn't. But they mentioned

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,880
a lot of interesting things, so we're going to have two language takeaways today. Let's

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,080
start with language takeaway part one.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Language takeaway

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,520
Alright, so one of the most common things you'll hear when we talk about the horoscope

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,000
in English is an outlook. And an outlook can be positive or negative. So what exactly is

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
an outlook?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,220
Well, if you notice Lydia said, my outlook is very positive. So basically she's talking

44
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,720
about her future.

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,320
Alright, so the way that she sees the future or the way that the horoscope talks about

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,520
the future is a positive one. So you could say, you know those eight balls? They're black

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,240
and they have like a message and you shake it and it gives you a message.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
You ask a question I think sometimes.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,000
You ask a question and it says outlook positive.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
That's right.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,500
Outlook negative. So that means in your near future things will either be positive or negative.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,320
So I guess you can apply it for example to a company. You say that a company has a positive

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
outlook.

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,160
Or even a person. You know he's a very positive person so he has a positive outlook. He thinks

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
good things are going to happen.

56
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:42,160
Okay, very good. So talking about horoscopes, obviously we must mention the 12 zodiac signs.

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,440
Okay, so each month has its own sign and they're not exactly the months. They're a little bit

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,800
different but each sign is kind of an animal or a symbol.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
That's right.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,880
So for example, a lot of August is part of the Leo sign in English. That's the lion.

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,320
And so the lion is the animal, the zodiac.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,080
So the zodiac sign is one of these signs. Like Leo is one of the zodiac signs. And I

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,200
guess all 12 signs are considered the zodiac or the horoscope.

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,360
Exactly and you can actually talk about the zodiac in terms of other cultures. There is

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,040
a Chinese zodiac. So we could say it's the year of the horse. But that's a little bit

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,320
different from what we're talking about here with the Western horoscope.

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay, very good. So all of this actually comes down to the, as we say, the pseudoscience

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,920
or the branch called astrology.

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,960
Astrology. So this is a very hard word for some people to remember because they want

70
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,120
to say astronomy. But it's different. Astronomy is the scientific study of the skies, the

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,800
stars, planets, things like that. Astrology is different. It's what we're talking about

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,320
here, the horoscope and reading the stars to understand what our personal futures will

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,560
hold for us.

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,600
That's right. So astronomy is an exact science part of, I guess, physics where you talk about

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,600
the stars or the composition of the stars and their movements. Whereas in astrology

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,200
we're talking about zodiacs and horoscopes and basically what star was in the sky when

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,520
you were born but in a different way. It's not very scientific.

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,040
That's right. So astrology is normally what you would see in the newspaper when you're

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,520
trying to find your horoscope, astrology or horoscope.

80
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,280
And actually every time you read the newspaper, if you look up your zodiac sign, it makes

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,760
a prediction about your day or your week or maybe even sometimes the month or year.

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,680
That's right. And so prediction is basically a guess about what will happen for you.

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,280
That's right. So many times you see that the horoscope will say finances are in trouble,

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,520
be careful with how you spend your money. So they're making a prediction that in the

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,680
future maybe you're going to have money problems so you have to be careful.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,720
Exactly or in the dialogue you will have a passionate summer fling. This is a prediction.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,240
It has not yet happened. It will happen.

88
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,480
That's right. That's right. A prediction. So now talking a little bit more about the

89
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,280
zodiac signs that we saw in the dialogue, we mentioned two, Aries and Capricorn.

90
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,920
So a lot of people who believe in astrology say that astrological signs are broken up.

91
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,040
They're divided into different kinds of sign. We have water signs, air signs, earth signs

92
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,760
and fire signs. One of the famous fire signs is Aries, right?

93
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,800
Aries. It's like the god of war in the Greek mythology.

94
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,880
That's right. So it's pronounced Aries. Aries.

95
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,840
A-R-I-E-S. Aries. That's right.

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,920
And the other one is a Capricorn. Capricorn. So that's like a goat?

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah. It's kind of like a ram. A ram.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,040
So an earth sign. That's right. So there are 12. These are just

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,040
two of them and obviously there are a lot more. I guess off the top of my head we have

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,520
Taurus or Leo. There's also a Scorpio.

101
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Sagittarius. Sagittarius.

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,360
Gemini. Gemini, which are like twins, twin people.

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,320
There's Pisces. Virgo.

104
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,520
And Virgo, the Virgin. And I don't know if we're missing anything.

105
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,280
I can't think now. We'll have to talk about it at the very end of today's lesson. But

106
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,800
we actually have some interesting things to talk about in a minute here. We have to talk

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,480
about the personality characteristics that are common when you're talking about different

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,880
zodiac signs. Okay. So before we get to that, let's listen

109
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:43,240
to our dialogue again. Hey, Lydia. What are you reading?

110
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month. My outlook is very positive. It says that

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,560
I should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

112
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,200
What are you talking about? Let me see that. What are horoscopes?

113
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,440
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for

114
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,280
the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries. When

115
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,800
were you born? January 5th.

116
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's see. You're a Capricorn. It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you

117
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,880
could see new exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting

118
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,960
summers. That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,360
work and my love life is practically non-existent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

120
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,200
No, it's not. Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It

121
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,600
says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

122
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,120
Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,880
What does it say about me? A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical.

124
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,880
She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you.

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,760
Alright, we're back. So now, let's take a look at these personality traits on Language

126
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
Takeaway Part 2.

127
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Language Takeaway

128
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,560
Alright, so one of the great words that we heard in today's dialogue was exotic. This

129
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,400
is not necessarily describing a person, but usually things or clothes or places. In this

130
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,160
instance, it was some place exotic. What's an exotic place?

131
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,880
It's basically a place that's very unique and I guess it's kind of not common to go

132
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,200
there or to find. For example, many people talk about an exotic getaway going to the

133
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,800
jungle because it's so exotic. You have so many strange animals and plants and everything

134
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
is so unfamiliar.

135
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,080
Right, so in my mind, Tahiti is very exotic. It's full of jungle and there's also beaches

136
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,000
and it's very unusual for someone who's from America because it's just so far away.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,040
That's right, exotic. So, someone can also have an exotic personality because maybe they're

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,920
a little bit strange or not strange but not so common, maybe unique.

139
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Yeah, although exotic is usually kind of a sexy thing when you're talking about people.

140
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,160
You know, she looks very exotic. That means she doesn't look like everybody else here.

141
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,000
That's right. But another adjective to describe someone's personality is somebody that's very

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
energetic.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,360
All right, so energetic sounds like the word energy. That's because they're related. So,

144
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,280
someone who's energetic has lots of energy. He or she likes to do a lot of things and

145
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,760
wants to always go places. You know the energetic person at your office. They always drink coffee.

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,960
Maybe they make everyone else really tired just listening to them.

147
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,840
That's right. And actually, a person that's energetic usually also loves to socialize.

148
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,680
That's right. So, loves to means they like to but they like it a lot, right? But to socialize

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,240
means to talk to other people or to go to parties or to meet new people.

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,480
So if it's a verb, to socialize means to talk to people, to meet people, to greet people.

151
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,480
You love to have contact with other people.

152
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,920
So yeah, you're right. Very, very common for people who are energetic.

153
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,280
Okay. And what about someone that's practical? What is that like?

154
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,520
Someone who's practical does a lot of things. Maybe someone who's practical always comes

155
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,200
to their activities prepared. So in my car, I'm very practical. I have extra water and

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,440
a spare tire. But you can also say, I'm a very practical person. I like to do things

157
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,600
that I can achieve as opposed to someone who always wants to do things that they can't

158
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
really achieve.

159
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,920
Okay. So a practical person is usually very realistic and very down to earth. Maybe someone

160
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,600
that's practical, if they're going on a trip, they'll only take what's necessary, not more

161
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
than they need.

162
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, exactly. Let me give you a good example. I like to go hiking and sometimes I see women

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
who have not made very practical decisions about the shoes they wear. So I like to wear

164
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,440
hiking boots. These are very practical. Wearing high heels on a mountain is not very practical.

165
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,640
That's right. Okay. Very good. Now, we also mentioned that a Capricorn is serious minded

166
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,440
and conventional in many ways.

167
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,360
Someone who's serious minded maybe doesn't like to have fun and go out and do things

168
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,080
that are silly. Someone who's serious minded is usually very practical, I think, and really

169
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,080
has a goal, wants to achieve that goal. No time to be silly. No time to make jokes.

170
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,880
So it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is boring, but they're just very, as you said,

171
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
practical.

172
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
That's right.

173
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,080
And what about that a Capricorn also likes to do things in conventional ways?

174
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,760
All right. So conventional means doing something in a conventional way means that you're doing

175
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,520
it in a traditional way. So this is a thing we've always done. We've always done it in

176
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,440
this way, and I'm going to continue to do it in this way. So the opposite is unconventional.

177
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,480
That means doing things in new ways, doing things with your imagination. And so something

178
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,520
that's very conventional is something that has been established, and we're just going

179
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,800
to continue doing it that way.

180
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,920
So for example, someone that gets married in a church is the conventional way, but someone

181
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,200
that gets married while skydiving is very unconventional.

182
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,920
That's right. Unconventional. Absolutely.

183
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,080
Very good. So a lot of great vocab here. Why don't we listen to her dialogue one last time,

184
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,920
and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

185
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:40,080
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?

186
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month. My outlook is very positive. It says that

187
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,400
I should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

188
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,040
What are you talking about? Let me see that. What are horoscopes?

189
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,280
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for

190
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,240
the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15, so I'm an Aries. When were

191
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
you born?

192
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,640
January 5.

193
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,960
Let's see. You're a Capricorn. It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,720
could see new exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting

195
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
summers.

196
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,760
That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically non-existent.

197
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,680
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

198
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,080
No it's not. Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See, it

199
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,400
says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

200
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

201
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
What does it say about me?

202
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,640
A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways.

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
That sounds just like you!

204
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,480
Alright, so talk about the horoscopes. Which sign are you?

205
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm a Leo, which is actually... I don't believe in the horoscope, but I have to say, every

206
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,160
time someone tells me about Leos, Leo the Lion, right? I agree with most of their descriptions

207
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,200
of my personality. So, outspoken, loves to socialize, very opinionated, which means I

208
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,400
have an opinion and I don't like to listen to other people, loves to argue very loud.

209
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,880
So these are all qualities that I think I have, and some of them are bad, some of them

210
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,800
are good, but you know, that's the way it is.

211
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,720
But you don't really believe in what magazines or newspapers say about your outlook?

212
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,760
Nah, I don't... yeah, the predictions are usually just basic guesses. But what about

213
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
you? What's your sign?

214
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,280
I am a Taurus, so I was born in May.

215
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
A bull.

216
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,880
A bull, yes. So I'm very stubborn and very strong. I don't really know what all the characteristics

217
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,200
about the Taurus are.

218
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Opinionated?

219
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Opinionated, I know that it's stubborn.

220
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Loves to argue?

221
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah, exactly.

222
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Doesn't like to be corrected?

223
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,840
Are you describing Taurus or are you describing me?

224
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Both.

225
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:13,040
All right, so it's actually very interesting. I think in many ways, sometimes the glove

226
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,640
does fit and someone's zodiac sign describes them very well. But again, maybe like the

227
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,160
dialogue says, they are very broad descriptions that basically any person can relate to.

228
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,120
Absolutely. I think that that's one of the tricks to horoscopes or to predicting someone's

229
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,040
future. You tell them enough very vague things that maybe some of them will fit and some

230
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
of them won't.

231
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
That's right.

232
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,080
But I'm very curious to hear about you guys. What are your signs? What's your sign? That

233
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,940
means what's your zodiac sign?

234
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,440
That's right. That's actually also a very common date question people say, oh, what's

235
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
your sign?

236
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Or a pickup line.

237
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Or a pickup line.

238
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Hey baby, what's your sign?

239
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,800
To see if you're compatible, right?

240
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,400
Right. So let us know. We're not trying to pick you up. We're just curious. You'll find

241
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,120
a lot of the words for the zodiac in today's lesson on our website, EnglishPod.com.

242
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
All right. We'll see you guys there.

243
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Bye.

244
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:29,280
Do it again, do it again.
