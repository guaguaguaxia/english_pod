00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello everyone and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,920
Erika, today we have a great intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,920
That's right.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,880
We've got a lesson about love.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,080
About love.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,080
And about apologizing.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,680
Ah, okay.

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,040
Love and apologizing.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,040
They go together.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,040
Yes, they do.

13
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,880
Especially if you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, right?

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
That's true.

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Okay, so why don't we start by looking at our vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,560
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,360
In today's vocabulary preview, we will learn two important words from our dialogue.

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,000
What's the first word?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
Knock over.

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
Knock over.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,520
Knock over.

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,360
Knock over.

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,640
So that's a really simple one.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,600
When you knock something over, you make it fall down.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,720
Make it fall down.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Yep.

27
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,240
So speaking of knocking things over, this morning I knocked over my coffee cup all over

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
my desk.

29
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Yeah, I saw that.

30
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,960
You almost ruined our lesson plan for today.

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,080
Yes, I did.

32
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,400
It was all over the place.

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,560
Okay, let's look at our second word.

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Explode.

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Explode.

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Explode.

37
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Explode.

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:28,240
So, when something explodes, this is what happens.

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,680
All right, that's pretty clear.

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,600
That's more than clear, I think.

41
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,120
So now we've looked at our two vocabulary preview words for this dialogue and we are

42
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:47,520
ready to listen to it for the first time.

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,640
What's going on?

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Watch out!

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Hey, watch where you're going.

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,680
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Are you all right?

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Oh, I don't know.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,880
I feel terrible.

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,820
I really didn't mean to knock you over.

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,520
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,880
Really it was an accident.

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Please accept my apologies.

54
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Just let me try to stand up.

55
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:36,740
Oh, wait a second, you seem really familiar.

56
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,780
I think I know you from somewhere.

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,060
Yeah, that's right.

58
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,120
I think we've met somewhere before.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,220
We met at Aaron's place last weekend.

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,940
What a coincidence.

61
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,420
But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

62
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,140
I've got a nine o'clock meeting.

63
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
But here's my number.

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,980
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

65
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,900
Ouch, my ankle.

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,420
I think it's broken.

67
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:06,340
You can't just leave me like this.

68
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,020
Are you calling an ambulance?

69
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:37,940
Nope, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

70
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,420
I love happy endings.

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
Such a romantic dialogue.

72
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah, this guy, oh my God, he is amazing.

73
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,540
I would love to meet a guy like that.

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,160
Like that, like crashing into you?

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,660
Maybe not like that.

76
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,700
Okay, well I think it's time to look at some of the language in this dialogue.

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,940
Let's start with our language takeaway.

78
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,380
Language takeaway.

79
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,820
Today we have three important words from our dialogue that we will learn for our language

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,140
takeaway.

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
The first word is familiar.

82
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,140
Familiar.

83
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,140
Familiar.

84
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,140
Familiar.

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,620
This one, I think, is a little bit hard to explain.

86
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,540
Yeah, so let's listen to some examples on how we use familiar.

87
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,140
Example one.

88
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,820
Norman Clark.

89
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,820
That name sounds familiar.

90
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,980
Where have I heard it before?

91
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,180
Example two.

92
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,180
Do you know where we are?

93
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,500
I have no idea.

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Nothing looks familiar.

95
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,140
I think we're lost.

96
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,980
Example three.

97
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,980
You look really familiar.

98
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,140
Did we go to high school together?

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,700
So when something's familiar, you think you know it, but you're not exactly sure.

100
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,460
Exactly, familiar.

101
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,700
Okay, our next word is place.

102
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Place.

103
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Place.

104
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,260
Aaron's place.

105
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Exactly.

106
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,140
So when we refer to place, we refer to house.

107
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,100
Right, so I can say, hey Marco, come over to my place for dinner tonight.

108
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,540
Exactly, or I could say, we're having a party at my place tonight at eight.

109
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,260
You might ask someone, how's your new place?

110
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Right.

111
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
How's your new apartment?

112
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,420
Exactly, that's a good one.

113
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,100
So place, it's a house.

114
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Right.

115
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,180
Our final word today is coincidence.

116
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Coincidence.

117
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Coincidence.

118
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
Coincidence.

119
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,340
So, again, we have some great examples for you to understand how we use coincidence.

120
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,420
Example one.

121
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,660
I'm going to New York this weekend.

122
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,540
What a coincidence, I am too.

123
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,740
Example two.

124
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:16,580
By coincidence, everyone in the room was named Alex.

125
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,460
Example three.

126
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,780
We met by pure coincidence.

127
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,260
One day we ran into each other on our bikes and we've been together ever since.

128
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,380
A coincidence is something that happens by chance, right?

129
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,460
Right, you didn't plan it, it just happened.

130
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, these funny little things happen all the time.

131
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,780
I love it when these coincidences happen.

132
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,540
Yeah, they're great.

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,220
So Erica, why don't you tell us about a coincidence that's happened to you?

134
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:53,260
Well, the other night I was having dinner in a restaurant and I looked up and I saw

135
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,220
my old professor from university.

136
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,060
It was such a coincidence because here we are in Shanghai and I see my professor from

137
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,980
Canada having dinner at the table next to me.

138
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,500
It was such a coincidence.

139
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
That is a coincidence.

140
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Yeah.

141
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,140
Or has it ever happened to you that you're thinking of someone and that person calls

142
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
you?

143
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,500
That happens all the time.

144
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
That's a coincidence.

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,820
Okay, so now that we have learned these three language takeaway words, we can listen to

147
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,660
our dialogue a second time but this time it's going to be slower.

148
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,140
Hey, watch where you're going.

149
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,220
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

150
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,460
Are you all right?

151
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,260
Oh, I don't know.

152
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,220
I feel terrible.

153
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,620
I didn't mean to knock you over.

154
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,420
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

155
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,900
Really, it was an accident.

156
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,260
Please accept my apologies.

157
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,300
Just let me try to stand up.

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,060
Oh, wait a second.

159
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,700
You seem really familiar.

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,460
I think I know you from somewhere.

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,140
Yeah, I think we have met somewhere before.

162
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
That's right.

163
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,060
We met at Aaron's place last weekend.

164
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,900
What a coincidence.

165
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,260
But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

166
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,060
I have a nine o'clock meeting.

167
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,740
But here's my number.

168
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,620
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

169
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,580
Ouch, my ankle.

170
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,920
I think it's broken.

171
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,660
You can't just leave me like this.

172
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,860
Are you calling an ambulance?

173
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,300
No, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

174
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:49,980
Well, that was much clearer, wasn't it?

175
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,700
Yes, that was clear.

176
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,500
And this brings us to Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Fluency Builder.

178
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,140
In today's Fluency Builder, we're going to show you different ways of apologizing.

179
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,540
It's so important to be able to apologize well and fluently.

180
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Exactly.

181
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,740
And you also want to say something different from I'm sorry.

182
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Right.

183
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,260
So that's what we're going to show you today.

184
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,100
We heard some great expressions for I'm sorry in the dialogue.

185
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Let's listen now.

186
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm so sorry.

187
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,420
I feel terrible.

188
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,380
Please accept my apologies.

189
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm so sorry.

190
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,540
I feel terrible.

191
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,100
Please accept my apologies.

192
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,980
Yeah, I feel terrible.

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,540
I say this one all the time.

194
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,300
Yeah, it's a great way of saying I'm sorry.

195
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,860
Now, also, if you want to say I'm sorry, you also want to tell the person that you made

196
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,100
a mistake, right?

197
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
That's true.

198
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,460
And we did hear some wonderful expressions for I made a mistake in this dialogue.

199
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,060
I didn't mean to knock you over.

200
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,060
It was an accident.

201
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,620
I didn't mean to knock you over.

202
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,940
It was an accident.

203
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,700
Well, I didn't mean to knock my coffee cup over this morning.

204
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Exactly.

205
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
It was an accident.

206
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,940
It was.

207
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,140
Not on purpose, right?

208
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,340
Or so you think.

209
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,940
Okay.

210
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,980
So all of these phrases are really useful and great for apologizing and telling someone

211
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,460
you made a mistake.

212
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,740
Well, it's time for us to listen to our dialogue a third time.

213
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,780
This time it will be at its normal speed and I think you'll be able to understand a little

214
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
bit better.

215
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
Whoa!

216
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,780
What's going on?

217
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Watch out!

218
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Hey, watch where you're going.

219
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,780
Oh, no.

220
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,780
I'm so sorry.

221
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
Are you alright?

222
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
Oh, I'm fine.

223
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
I'm fine.

224
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm fine.

225
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
I'm fine.

226
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I'm fine.

227
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
I'm fine.

228
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,780
I'm fine.

229
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
I'm fine.

230
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm fine.

231
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm fine.

232
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,780
I'm fine.

233
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
I'm fine.

234
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm fine.

235
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
I'm fine.

236
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I'm fine.

237
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
I'm fine.

238
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Ugh, I don't know.

239
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
I feel terrible.

240
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I really didn't mean to knock you over.

241
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,180
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

242
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,940
Really, it was an accident.

243
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,500
Please accept my apologies.

244
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,120
Just let me try to stand up.

245
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,040
Why do birds suddenly appear?

246
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh, wait a second.

247
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
You seem really familiar.

248
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,800
I think I know you from somewhere.

249
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,080
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,120
I think we've met somewhere before.

251
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,240
We met at Aaron's place last weekend.

252
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,960
What a coincidence.

253
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,440
But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt, and I should probably get going.

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,200
I've got a nine o'clock meeting.

255
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
But here's my number.

256
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,160
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

257
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Ouch!

258
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
My ankle!

259
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,480
I think it's broken.

260
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:04,360
You can't just leave me like this!

261
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
Are you calling an ambulance?

262
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Nope.

263
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

264
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,440
Great dialogue and great music, right?

265
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Awful music.

266
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Who picked that, Marco?

267
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,880
Of course, me.

268
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm a romantic type.

269
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
I love romantic music.

270
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Really?

271
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Yes.

272
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,880
Well, speaking of a romantic type, do you believe in love at first sight?

273
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I kind of do.

274
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Really?

275
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
I'd like to believe it.

276
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Yeah, well...

277
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
That surprises me.

278
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,760
Well, I think the first time that you see someone, it impresses you some way, and you

279
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
feel attracted to that person.

280
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Really?

281
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Yeah.

282
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,640
What is the first feeling that you get that makes you want to talk to that person or get

283
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,840
to know that person?

284
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,640
I am the exact opposite.

285
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Really?

286
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,240
When I see somebody for the first time, my first impression is, oh, it's wrong.

287
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,760
So if I see someone and I like them at the beginning, in three weeks I'll hate them.

288
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,800
And if I see someone and I don't like them when I first meet them, I'll be their best

289
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
friend.

290
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,600
So love at first sight doesn't work for me.

292
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm sure that our listeners have some stories that love at first sight.

293
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Maybe they've met their wives or their boyfriends in this way.

294
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,040
I'd like to hear about it.

295
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,120
Me too.

296
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,120
And if anybody knows the name of the songs we used, also be sure to post it on the discussion

297
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
board.

298
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
That's right.

299
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Our challenge for this week.

300
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,680
Our challenge for this lesson.

301
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Yeah.

302
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,000
So that's all for today, everyone, but be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,960
and as we said, leave all your comments, your stories, and see if you know the name of the

304
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
songs.

305
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Okay, well, thanks for listening, everyone, and until next time, goodbye.

306
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Bye.

307
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:33,880
Bye.
