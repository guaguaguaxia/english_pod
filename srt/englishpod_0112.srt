00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,080
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,740
And today we are going to be looking at a very useful lesson because, well, sometimes

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,500
you need to call a plumber.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, so first of all, why don't we start with vocabulary preview because I think we

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,780
need to know this word, plumber.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,780
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,640
All right, so on vocabulary preview today we're going to look at two words and the first

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
one is the one that we mentioned, plumber.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,640
A plumber.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,280
So it's a person, a plumber.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Yep.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,400
And a plumber is the person who fixes everything in your house that is related to water, right?

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,040
Okay, so he fixes the toilet, the sink, the shower.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,600
Yep, that's the plumber.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,840
And now the second word is obviously related to plumber and it's water pipes.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,180
Water pipes.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,180
Water pipes.

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,240
The pipes.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,240
So the plumber fixes or looks at the water pipes as well.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Yep.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,160
And those are a tube that carries water in and out of your house.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,640
Okay, so water pipes.

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,720
You also have different types of pipes like gas pipes.

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Yep.

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Okay.

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,120
Okay, so what are we learning in this lesson?

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,600
So in this lesson we're going to be learning how to describe when you have problems with

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,520
plumbing, when you have problems in your sink or in your toilet and how you can describe

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
it.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,760
And so I think we should take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see what types

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:44,000
of problems this woman is having with her plumbing.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Good afternoon.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Did you call for a plumber?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, yes I did.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please come in.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm so glad you came.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
This old house is falling apart.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,480
Come into the bathroom.

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
See here.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,480
There's water leaking everywhere.

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,600
I see.

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Let me have a look.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,600
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,880
Let me just get my plunger.

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,480
No, that's not working either.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,320
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

49
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,240
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,800
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
You know how kids are.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,120
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,880
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,640
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
That might lead to more problems in the future.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,120
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,360
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
That would be great.

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,080
Is it expensive?

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
Let's see.

62
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,640
I would say about $800.

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
What?

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
That's more than I'm making a...

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,360
All right, well, it sounds like she's having some big problems with her plumbing, but actually,

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,880
I'm really interested that the plumber makes so much money.

67
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,320
That is a very interesting thing, and we're going to talk a little bit about that later

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,080
on, but I think we should look at those kind of difficult words that we found in the dialogue

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,240
now in Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,200
Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,360
So we have five words here, all to do with a plumber and water pipes.

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,900
Now the first word, they talked about that there was water leaking everywhere.

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,160
So you have water leaking.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Water leaking.

75
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,800
So to leak.

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,080
When something leaks, it lets liquid come out when it shouldn't.

77
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,160
Okay, when it shouldn't.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,640
So maybe you have a bottle of water and it's closed, but maybe there's a hole in the bottle.

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
So it leaks.

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
So it leaks.

81
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,520
All right, and so there was water everywhere, it was leaking, and maybe the reason was because

82
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,840
the toilet is clogged.

83
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Okay, clogged.

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,440
The toilet's clogged.

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Clogged.

86
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,160
Now, what does it mean if the toilet is clogged?

87
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,920
If the toilet is clogged, there is something that stops the water from going down.

88
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,440
Okay, so there's something blocking it.

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,880
Okay, a clogged toilet.

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,040
Now the plumber said that it might be clogged and he tried to fix it with a plunger.

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
A plunger.

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
A plunger.

93
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
A plunger.

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay, so it's kind of hard to describe what a plunger is, so why don't we listen to the

95
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:43,420
sound a plunger makes in a toilet.

96
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,480
All right, so the plunger is the tool that you use to unclog a toilet.

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay, that's what you use, a plunger.

98
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,480
So the plunger didn't work and he wasn't able to fix the toilet and he said that there's

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,040
something in the pipes causing a blockage.

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,000
All right, so our next word, a blockage.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Blockage.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, a blockage is something that stops water from flowing.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,640
Okay, so something is blocking it.

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
So you have blockage.

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Yep.

106
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Very good.

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,440
And we have one more word on Language Takeaway and that word is faucet.

108
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
A faucet.

109
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
A faucet.

110
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,360
All right, so the faucet is the part of the sink that lets water come out.

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,800
Okay, so you have a faucet in your sink.

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,480
Yeah, so you put your hands under the faucet so you can wash them.

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,920
Okay, that's the faucet.

114
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah.

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Very good.

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,520
So now that we've learned about these different tools and these different ways of describing

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,000
problems with your plumbing, let's listen to this dialogue another time, a little bit

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,960
slower now, and then we'll come back and take a look at some great phrases.

119
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,680
Good afternoon.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,920
Did you call for a plumber?

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,800
Yes, yes, I did.

122
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Please come in.

123
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm so glad you came.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,160
This old house is falling apart.

125
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
Come on into the bathroom.

126
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,840
See here, there's water leaking everywhere.

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,320
I see.

128
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Let me have a look.

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,360
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,440
Let me just get my plunger.

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,200
No, that's not working either.

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,600
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a blockage.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

135
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

136
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
You know how kids are.

137
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

138
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,880
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they should also be changed.

139
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,040
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

140
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,680
That might lead to more problems in the future.

141
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,280
I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

142
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

143
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
That would be great.

144
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,720
Is it expensive?

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Let's see.

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
I would say about $800.

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
What?

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon.

149
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,560
Well, we've got three phrases that you can use when you need to describe something not

150
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
working with the pipes.

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,880
So let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

152
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,240
Fluency Builder.

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,960
So the lady called the plumber and he arrived and well, she described her house as old and

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,320
that it's falling apart.

155
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
It's falling apart.

156
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,800
This old house is falling apart.

157
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,520
So when something is falling apart, it's old and it's breaking slowly.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Exactly.

159
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,360
So we can say the house is falling apart or maybe this old car is falling apart.

160
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,760
You can also use it for people.

161
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh, I'm getting so old and falling apart.

162
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Very good.

163
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
So you're getting sick.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Yeah.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
All right.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Very good.

167
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Now for our second word.

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,120
Well, the woman said that maybe her daughter was flushing things down the toilet.

169
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,360
Okay, so to flush something down the toilet.

170
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,440
To flush something down the toilet.

171
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,560
So before we explain this, let's listen to a toilet being flushed.

172
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:32,160
Okay, so that's the sound of flushing and when you flush something down the toilet,

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
what happens?

174
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,600
Basically, you throw something into the toilet and then you flush it.

175
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
So it goes away.

176
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
All right.

177
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
So flushing something down the toilet.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,680
Well, she also talked about the faucet and it wasn't shutting off properly.

179
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Shutting off.

180
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,920
To shut off.

181
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Okay.

182
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,340
Shut off.

183
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,320
When you shut something off, you turn it off.

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Okay.

185
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,480
So we can say to shut something off or to shut off something.

186
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Right.

187
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,960
So, hey, Marco, can you shut off the computer?

188
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,600
Okay, or I can say, can you shut the faucet off?

189
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Exactly.

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Great.

191
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
So we took a look at these three phrases that will help you describe again, these situations

192
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,160
or problems that may happen in your bathroom or with liquids.

193
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,320
And well, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll come back and talk

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:31,000
a little bit more.

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Good afternoon.

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Did you call for a plumber?

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, yes, I did.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please come in.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm so glad you came.

200
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
This old house is falling apart.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Come into the bathroom.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
See, here.

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
There's water leaking everywhere.

204
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,580
I see.

205
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,800
Let me have a look.

206
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,600
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

207
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,760
Let me just get my plunger.

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,480
No that's not working either.

209
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,320
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

210
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

211
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,240
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

212
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,800
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

213
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,000
You know how kids are.

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,160
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

215
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,840
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty so they also should be changed.

216
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,600
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

217
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
That might lead to more problems in the future.

218
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,080
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

219
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,320
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

220
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,600
That would be great.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,040
Is it expensive?

222
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,200
Let's see.

223
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I would say about $800.

224
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
What?

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,920
That's more than I make in a day and I'm...

226
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,480
We heard in this dialogue that this plumber is making about $800.

227
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
That's a lot of money.

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,760
That's a lot of money.

229
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,640
And actually this in many countries is not far from the truth.

230
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
That's right.

231
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,800
For example, in Canada, there is a shortage.

232
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,940
There's not enough of these people like plumbers who can do this type of work so they can charge

233
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
a lot of money.

234
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,360
So this type of work is called a...

235
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,240
He's not really a professional, right?

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Right.

237
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
He is a trades person because he works in a trade.

238
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Okay.

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,280
So like a plumber, an electrician, a person that paints your house, those are all trades.

240
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,480
And well, it is true because now many people don't want to learn or do these types of trade

241
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,240
because well, it's not considered to be such a great job, right?

242
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah.

243
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,760
But the funny thing is now if you're a plumber and you get your first job as a young person,

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,200
you can make so much more money than a person with a history degree, for example.

245
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Exactly.

246
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,240
Because there is a shortage of these types of...

247
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
You can call them professionals.

248
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Yep.

249
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Right.

250
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
So well, what about in your countries?

251
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,520
Let us know how these types of trades work.

252
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,640
Are there many of them?

253
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,500
Are there not many of them?

254
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,480
Because well, of course, in different countries, it's a little bit different, right?

255
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,480
In some countries, there are too many tradesmen.

256
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,120
So visit us on our website, EnglishPod.com and tell us all about that.

257
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,760
And remember, if you have any questions about the lesson, you can ask them there as well.

258
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
All right.

259
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,800
So we'll see you guys there.

260
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
And until next time.

261
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.

262
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:44,080
Bye.
