00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,640
My name is Katrin and today we have a very dangerous lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
That's right.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,360
Today we're going to talk about guns or specifically about weapons.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,840
So yeah, we're talking about kinds of guns.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,000
There are more than I think I ever knew and we're going to discuss about six today.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,800
But before we get going, Marco, we've got a phrase in vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
That's right.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,880
So today on vocabulary preview, we're going to take a look at shooting range.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,440
Have you ever been to one of these places?

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,080
Yes, a shooting range.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,840
It's a place like you say, and it's a place where you can fire your weapons or you can

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,280
use guns safely so you don't kill anyone or you don't hurt someone.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,040
No, basically, yeah, it's a place to practice shooting.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,800
So maybe for example, if you want to practice how to shoot guns, you go to this place and

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,240
they have special things to help you improve your shooting abilities.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,120
Usually these are very, very secure.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,600
They have guards and things because you don't want to give the guns out to anybody.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
That's right.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,720
But let's listen to today's dialogue about a shooting range and find out what kinds of

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:14,280
guns they have.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,600
Hey Nick, what are you up to?

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Not much.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Just heading over to the shooting range.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
You want to come?

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Seriously?

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,120
You mean to fire a real weapon?

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I don't know, man.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,640
Yeah, it will be fun.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,800
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,400
I also have a revolver that's really fun too.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,160
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah, that would be cool.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,400
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Or what about a flamethrower?

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
Whoa, take it easy there, Rambo.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't get carried away.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,080
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,720
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,560
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,960
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,880
unless you are ready to shoot.

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,280
Wow, I didn't know.

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,800
The reality is different, you know.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,680
Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
So are you ready?

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Let's do it!

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Alright we're back.

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,560
So obviously this guy was very excited about using these weapons.

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,000
And you may have heard that we're using this word weapons.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,760
It's basically all of these things.

55
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,920
I guess anything that can be used in defense or hurt someone.

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
Yes, anything that can be used to hurt someone as a weapon.

57
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,080
So a knife can be a weapon, not just guns.

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
Guns are a kind of weapon.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
That's right.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
So if we're looking at our first type of gun or our first type of weapon, we have a 9mm

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
pistol.

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,640
Okay, so the weapon is the pistol.

63
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,280
And the pistol is basically a handgun.

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,640
But it comes in different sizes.

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,920
So that's what the 9mm refers to.

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
That's right.

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,220
That's the size of the projectile that will come out of the weapon.

68
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,440
And a pistol, as you said, it's a handgun.

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,720
It's usually small.

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,520
And it can fit in your hand, so you can use just one hand to use this weapon.

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Okay, so there's a similar handgun that's a little bit bigger.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,520
That's called a revolver.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,880
That's right, a revolver.

74
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,000
So this one has a revolving chamber.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,960
So you kind of see this in the old western movies when they have six bullets, right?

76
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,200
And they like swing their guns into their side holsters.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yeah.

78
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Well, yeah, that's right.

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
The revolver refers to the...

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,280
Well, to revolve, it means to move around, to spin.

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
That's right.

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,640
So the place with the bullets basically spins after you shoot the gun.

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
That's right.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
So that's why it's called a revolver.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,040
Unlike the pistol, the pistol will usually not really have a revolver.

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,000
It will have a magazine.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Now, moving on to our next type of weapon, we have the very famous machine gun.

89
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,880
That's the one that shoots off really fast.

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,920
And so basically, it's called a machine gun because it's automatically releasing all these

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
bullets at once.

92
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,640
You just pull the trigger and many, many, many bullets come out.

93
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
That's right.

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,040
So in a pistol or in a revolver, usually you have to press the trigger once and it shoots

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
only once.

96
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,720
But in a machine gun, you can keep it pressed and all these bullets will start flying out.

97
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,200
Very, very dangerous.

98
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Very dangerous.

99
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Okay.

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
So now moving on to the next one, we also took a look at a shotgun.

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
This is...

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Well, this is not the biggest gun we're going to talk about today.

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,440
But it's a very large gun, very long, and you have to use two hands to hold it.

105
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,400
This is what you usually use when you go hunting, right?

106
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
That's right.

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,120
So as you said, it's very long and it's very loud.

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,080
And it doesn't really shoot bullets.

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,040
It shoots little pellets, little cartridges that are filled with little rocks, for example.

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
And that's what it shoots.

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,800
And this is why it's not very precise like a machine gun or a handgun, but it does a

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
lot of damage.

113
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Absolutely.

114
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,200
And what's something else that does a lot of damage?

115
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
Our next gun will do that.

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Well, this guy got a little bit excited and he said he wanted to use a rocket launcher.

117
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Okay.

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,920
So you know what a rocket is.

119
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,520
A rocket is something that's basically a projectile that goes into the sky and can basically blow

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,240
up big buildings or cars.

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
That's right.

122
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,640
And that's what a rocket launcher is.

123
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,720
Now, maybe you've heard of the word bazooka.

124
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
A bazooka is a type of rocket launcher.

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
It's the one...

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
It's very, very, very wide and it's circular.

127
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,520
And you usually see it in movies like Rambo, we talked about, where Rambo will hold it

128
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
on one shoulder.

129
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
It's so big.

130
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Yeah, exactly.

131
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,880
And the rocket shoots out and can destroy huge buildings.

132
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
That's exactly right.

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,760
So that's why it's called a rocket launcher.

134
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,400
Now for our last type of weapon, we have a flamethrower.

135
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Okay.

136
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, a flame refers to fire.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,960
So fire has flames.

138
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,360
Those are the parts that kind of come up on a fire.

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
They're red and orange.

140
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,360
And a flamethrower is a device, is a weapon that will shoot flames, not bullets.

141
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Exactly.

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,680
It was very popular back in World War II to actually shoot the flamethrower into bunkers

143
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,880
or into holes because then this is how you can get people out of there.

144
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,760
And I think flamethrowers are used now to some sort of degree like to fumigate sometimes

145
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
or to burn weeds when you're in a field.

146
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Right.

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,160
But they're not really used as weapons anymore.

148
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,960
Although I think that I've seen a number of them in action movies.

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Really?

150
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Yeah.

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
In action movies, of course.

152
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,040
So we have a lot of guns, a lot of different types of weapons.

153
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,000
Why don't we go back to the dialogue?

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Let's listen to it again and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

155
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Hey Nick.

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
What are you up to?

157
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Not much.

158
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,920
Just heading over to the shooting range.

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
You want to come?

160
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Seriously?

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,320
You mean to fire a real weapon?

162
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I don't know, man.

163
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
Yeah, it will be fun.

164
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

165
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,600
I also have a revolver that's really fun too.

166
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,400
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

167
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,860
Yeah, that would be cool.

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,560
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun.

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,200
Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile.

170
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Or what about a flamethrower?

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,920
Whoa, take it easy there, Rambo.

172
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
Don't get carried away.

173
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,280
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

174
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,920
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

175
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,760
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,160
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger

177
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,040
unless you are ready to shoot.

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,480
Wow, I didn't know.

179
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,160
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

180
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,040
The reality is different, you know.

181
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,920
Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

182
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,280
So are you ready?

183
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Let's do it.

184
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,760
All right, we're back.

185
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,280
So now let's take a look at our phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

186
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,680
Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,080
So this first phrase comes from the beginning of today's dialogue when Nick is saying,

188
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,400
well I'm not doing much, I'm just heading over to the shooting range.

189
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
That's right.

190
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,200
So we know what shooting range is but when he says I'm heading over to the shooting range.

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,680
Well this can be confusing because to head over has nothing to do with the head on your

192
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
body.

193
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Right.

194
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,800
It means I'm going towards some place.

195
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,520
I'm going to this place.

196
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,760
So it's just another way of saying going to, right?

197
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,520
So for example, you can say I'm heading over to my friend's house this afternoon.

198
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,160
That's right, so I'm going to my friend's house this afternoon.

199
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,880
But remember that this is a pretty relaxed, pretty informal way of saying something so

200
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
you wouldn't say I'm heading over to work.

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Right.

202
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,600
You say hey I'm heading over to his house to hang out or I'm heading over to the pizza

203
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,720
restaurant to grab a bite to eat.

204
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
That's right.

205
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Okay.

206
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,080
So now obviously we saw that one of the guys got very excited about the idea of using all

207
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,680
these cool weapons and his friend said whoa, take it easy there Rambo.

208
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
Don't get carried away.

209
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
I love this phrase.

210
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,440
This phrase is something you say to someone who is maybe too excited about something.

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
That's right.

212
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
It means don't go crazy.

213
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Don't exaggerate.

214
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Right.

215
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,880
So maybe at the shooting range they'll have a revolver and they'll have a pistol but they're

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,400
probably not going to have a rocket launcher or as he said an anti-tank missile.

217
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,240
These are crazy weapons from movies.

218
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,440
And so the friend is saying no, you're exaggerating.

219
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Don't get carried away.

220
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,560
Now for example maybe you go to the mall and you go shopping and maybe you got a little

221
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,280
bit carried away and you spent too much money.

222
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,360
That always happens to me during the holidays.

223
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,760
I get carried away and I buy way too much stuff.

224
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
That's right.

225
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,140
So that's the way that you would use carried away.

226
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,560
And now for our last phrase, he was actually explaining a couple of rules of weapon handling

227
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,400
and he said that there are some rules that he has to abide by.

228
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Okay.

229
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
So this is a fixed phrase.

230
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,520
We use the verb to abide with a word like the rules.

231
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,280
So to abide by the rules or we must all abide by the rules.

232
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,640
This is a fancy way of saying to follow the rules or to recognize the rules.

233
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
That's right.

234
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,220
So you have to abide by the rules of your school or maybe you have to, everyone has

235
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,400
to abide by the law.

236
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Right.

237
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,480
Or some people can say there are rules in the Bible that other people abide by.

238
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
That's right.

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Okay.

240
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
So a lot of great stuff.

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,800
I think we've taken a look at a lot of different types of weapons and phrases.

242
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,960
So pretty interesting stuff.

243
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,440
Why don't we listen to it for the last time.

244
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,280
Hey Nick.

245
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
What are you up to?

246
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Not much.

247
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,680
Just heading over to the shooting range.

248
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
You want to come?

249
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Seriously?

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,040
You mean to fire a real weapon?

251
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I don't know man.

252
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Yeah.

253
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
I'm having fun.

254
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,760
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

255
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,040
I also have a revolver that's really fun too.

256
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

257
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Yeah.

258
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,640
That would be cool.

259
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,360
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun.

260
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile.

261
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Or what about a flamethrower?

262
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Whoa.

263
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
Take it easy there Rambo.

264
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't get carried away.

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,040
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

266
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,680
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,520
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

268
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger

269
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,840
unless you are ready to shoot.

270
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Wow.

271
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,240
I didn't know.

272
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,880
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

273
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,760
The reality is different you know.

274
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,640
Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

275
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,040
So are you ready?

276
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,800
Let's do it.

277
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
All right we're back.

278
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,840
So talking about weapons and pistols and all this.

279
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,120
Have you ever used one of these?

280
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Have you ever shot?

281
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
I have.

282
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,880
I have been to a couple shooting ranges and have fired a couple of guns.

283
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,080
I've never fired a shotgun.

284
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
They don't usually.

285
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Well sometimes.

286
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Yeah.

287
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Sometimes they have a shotgun.

288
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Sometimes they have them.

289
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Sure.

290
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
But I've shot pistols before.

291
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,680
And do you like it?

292
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
I like it.

293
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
It's an interesting activity.

294
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,280
I don't know how I feel about using guns on people but I understand why hunting is an

295
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,520
enjoyable sport because there is a sport aspect to it.

296
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,120
You know you really have to control your body and you can improve.

297
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
You can get better.

298
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,360
It's like darts but with loud guns.

299
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,720
And it's very hard to aim actually to hit something.

300
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
People think it's very easy like in the movies.

301
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,280
Well and I think it's particularly hard with handguns.

302
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Yes.

303
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
Because they're very powerful.

304
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Some of them can be very powerful.

305
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,880
And so there's a kick.

306
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Yeah.

307
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,640
And you don't realize it the first time you shoot a gun.

308
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,280
You're like oh that was way harder than it looks in the movies.

309
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,040
I bet you're a good shot right?

310
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Yeah.

311
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Yeah.

312
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,760
I've always really enjoyed weapons and my aim is alright.

313
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Although my eyesight kind of.

314
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,520
I need to use glasses so it can be a little bit tricky sometimes.

315
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,380
Especially when you shoot a weapon sometimes it's very.

316
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,040
You just cleaned it so it has a lot of oil and it'll kick out into your face and get

317
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
your glasses wet.

318
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,240
Well that's why we use goggles at the shooting ranges that I go to.

319
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,480
But I'm curious to know have you guys ever shot a gun before?

320
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,120
Have you ever been to a shooting range?

321
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,160
Are shooting ranges legal in your country?

322
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Yeah.

323
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Some places they're not.

324
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Yeah.

325
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
So let us know.

326
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

327
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Alright.

328
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
We'll see you guys there.

329
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:15,700
My name's Andrew Cline for Android Authenticated and we'll see ya!
