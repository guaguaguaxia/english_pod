00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
How are you, Erika?

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,440
Marco, I'm doing really well.

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
How about you?

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
I'm doing great.

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,180
I'm really excited because today we're talking about travel.

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,180
That's right.

10
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,760
We're going to give you some real English to talk about travel.

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
Exactly.

12
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,000
English that you would use in everyday life, that you hear in movies and TV shows.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,800
English people actually use.

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Exactly.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,200
So why don't you tell us a little bit about this lesson for today?

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, so today we are going to listen as a husband and wife get ready to go on a trip.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That sounds a little bit complicated.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,760
Well, let's look at our two preview words.

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Vocabulary Preview.

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Okay.

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,920
So the first word that we have is road trip.

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,200
Road trip.

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Road trip.

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Road trip.

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Okay.

28
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,640
So road trips are really fun and interesting, right?

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,260
Road trips are great.

30
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,960
You get to get in a car with your family and drive on a vacation.

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,520
Yeah, those are really fun and they're really popular in North America.

32
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Really popular.

33
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,760
I've been on a million road trips.

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
All right.

35
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,080
We'll talk about that a little bit later on.

36
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,120
But now, let's take a look at our second word and it's the car's packed.

37
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,960
The car's packed.

38
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,340
The car's packed.

39
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,280
The car is packed.

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,820
So when your car is packed, it means that...

41
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,120
Everything you need is inside the car.

42
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
All right.

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,080
So your bags, your food, everything that you need for your trip.

44
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Exactly.

45
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Perfect.

46
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Okay.

47
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,800
So those were our two preview words and now we are ready to listen to the dialogue for

48
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
the first time.

49
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Okay.

50
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
This dialogue will be at normal speed.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,140
It will be fast.

52
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,480
But don't worry if you don't understand everything.

53
00:01:47,480 --> 00:02:00,360
After 10 minutes, we promise you will understand everything in this lesson.

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,600
So are we all ready to go?

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Yep.

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I think so.

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
The car's packed.

58
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,400
We have munchies and music and the map's in the car.

59
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Did you get the camera?

60
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Got it.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Did you fill up the tank?

62
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Yep.

63
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,960
It's all set.

64
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,240
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm sure.

66
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
We've got all our bases covered.

67
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Well, let's get going then.

68
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,560
I love road trips.

69
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:37,720
Do you think we can make a pit stop?

70
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,080
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
I know.

72
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,520
But I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

73
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,840
Well she forgot to go to the bathroom.

74
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Yeah.

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,160
I hate it when this happens.

76
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,760
This happens to me on almost every road trip.

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Okay.

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Great.

79
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,320
So now it's time for our language takeaway.

80
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,920
We have three words for our language takeaway today.

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,040
Language takeaway.

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,960
And the first word is munchies.

83
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Munchies.

84
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Munchies.

85
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
So munchies are...

86
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Snacks.

87
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Snacks.

88
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Food.

89
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Food.

90
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Chips.

91
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Chips.

92
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Cookies.

93
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Chocolate bars.

94
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
All that good stuff.

95
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I love munchies.

96
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
And they're really good when you're taking a road trip.

97
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Indeed.

98
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay.

99
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,400
So let's take a look at our second language takeaway word for today.

100
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,640
And it is fill up the tank.

101
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,160
Fill up the tank.

102
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,680
Fill up the tank.

103
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,920
Fill up the tank.

104
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
So this is to...

105
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,920
Put gas in your car.

106
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,800
Put gas in the gas tank.

107
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
In the gas tank.

108
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Exactly.

109
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
All right.

110
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Our last language takeaway today is...

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Pit stop.

112
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Pit stop.

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Pit stop.

114
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Make a pit stop.

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
It's a quick stop for you to get some gas, food, go to the bathroom.

116
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah.

117
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
A pit stop.

118
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
A quick stop.

119
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Great.

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
So now it's time for putting it together.

121
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
Putting it together.

122
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,520
So we have two great phrases for you today.

124
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,080
Let's take a look at the first one.

125
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,240
We've got all our bases covered.

126
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,600
We've got all our bases covered.

127
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
We've got all our bases covered.

128
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,920
This is a really great phrase and it's really useful, right?

129
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Yeah.

130
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's listen to a couple of examples.

131
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,120
Example one.

132
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,680
We've got all our bases covered in case the hurricane hits.

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
Example two.

134
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,680
Okay.

135
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,280
I have my keys, wallet, and passport.

136
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
Looks like I have all my bases covered.

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
Okay.

138
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,000
It's clear now, but you can use this in a lot of different situations, right?

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,720
You can use this in many situations.

140
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,000
If I'm at work, I could say, all right, we've got a really good marketing plan.

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
We've got all our bases covered.

142
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Exactly.

143
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
You have everything ready.

144
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
You're all prepared.

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Perfect.

146
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
All right.

147
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,200
Now, let's take a look at our second phrase and it's, let's get going.

148
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
Let's get going.

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
Let's get going.

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Let's get going.

151
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
All right.

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,800
So, when you say, let's get going, it just means...

153
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Let's start.

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Let's start.

155
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Let's go.

156
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Yeah.

157
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay.

158
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
But the interesting thing about this phrase is you can change it a little bit and it means

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
something different.

160
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Uh-huh.

161
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
Let's listen to a couple of examples.

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,000
Example one.

163
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,360
I have the chicken, so let's get cooking.

164
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Example two.

165
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,820
This house is really scary.

166
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,640
Let's get out of here.

167
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,720
Example three.

168
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,960
I have another meeting in 20 minutes, so let's get down to business.

169
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,560
So let's get down to business, Marco.

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
Let's get down to business.

171
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,560
Let's listen to the dialogue one more time, but this time...

172
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,080
It'll be a little bit slower and you'll understand much better.

173
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,200
So are we all ready to go?

174
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,160
Yep, I think so.

175
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,960
The car's packed, we have munchies and music, and the map's in the car.

176
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,640
Did you get the camera?

177
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Got it.

178
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
Did you fill up the tank?

179
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,400
Yep, it's all set.

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm sure.

182
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,680
We've got all our bases covered.

183
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,880
Well, let's get going then.

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,560
I love road trips.

185
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,840
Um, do you think we can make a pit stop?

186
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,120
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,720
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,240
So that was a little more clear this time, wasn't it?

189
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,800
Yeah, you can definitely understand better about what we've been talking about.

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Yep.

191
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Okay, so now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

192
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,000
Erika, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

193
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,600
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great, useful phrases to help you express your ideas

194
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
clearly.

195
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Okay, great.

196
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,040
So let's look at Fluency Builder.

197
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Fluency Builder.

198
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,840
All right, so we all know how to ask the question, are we ready to go?

199
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
That's right.

200
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,640
Can we go now?

201
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,880
Or you can say, are we ready to go?

202
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Exactly.

203
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,640
But there's another way that we can say this, and we heard it in our dialogue.

204
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,360
So let's listen.

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,400
So are we all ready to go?

206
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,920
So are we all ready to go?

207
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,240
Wow, that sounds really good.

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,320
It sounds a lot more fluent.

209
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,680
Fluent, exactly.

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Yeah.

211
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,320
Okay, so another simple phrase that we all know how to say is, it is ready.

212
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,720
It is prepared.

213
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
It is ready.

214
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Right.

215
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,280
So these examples are fine.

216
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
They're right.

217
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah, they're correct English, no problem.

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,440
But there's another way to say this that we heard in the dialogue, and it sounds a lot

219
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
more fluent.

220
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Yep, it's all set.

221
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,500
Yep, it's all set.

222
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
It's all set.

223
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,000
That sounds much better.

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,320
Yes, and we're all set to listen to this dialogue for a third time, and this time it's going

225
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:38,700
to be at its normal speed.

226
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,920
So are we all ready to go?

227
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,240
Yep, I think so.

228
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
The car's packed.

229
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,720
We have munchies and music and the map's in the car.

230
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Did you get the camera?

231
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Got it.

232
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Did you fill up the tank?

233
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,280
Yep, it's all set.

234
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,560
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

235
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,720
I'm sure.

236
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
We've got all our bases covered.

237
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
Well, let's get going then.

238
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,080
I love road trips.

239
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you think we can make a pit stop?

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

241
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,600
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

242
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,880
So, Erika, you said you've been on a million road trips.

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
What was that all about?

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where have you been?

245
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,400
Okay, well, maybe not a million road trips, but many road trips.

246
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,000
Every summer I used to go on a road trip with my family, and we would drive many, many hours,

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,240
probably eight hours in one day, up to northern Canada.

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,800
Oh, wow, nice.

249
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,440
Yeah, and then we would go camping, and we would sleep outside, and we would have a campfire

250
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
at night.

251
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
It was great.

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Ah, family road trip.

253
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,760
Yeah, but maybe eight hours in a car is a little too long.

254
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Well, yeah.

255
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Well, I've been on a different kind of road trip with some buddies of mine, some friends.

256
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,680
We would drive to Las Vegas.

257
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Really?

258
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Yeah.

259
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
So that's really fun.

260
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,120
A bunch of crazy guys in a car going to Las Vegas, and then just having fun and talking

261
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,160
about everything.

262
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,720
So that's a much different experience than a family road trip.

263
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,320
Maybe that sounds a little bit more fun.

264
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Yeah, eight hours in a car is not really that boring with all your friends.

265
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,800
All right, folks, we're out of time for today, but be sure to visit our website at EnglishPod.com

Okay, well, thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:47,200
Bye.
