00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,680
My name is Catherine and today we're going to a very special place, Marco, a place where

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,040
men and women alike, but usually women are associated with it.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,520
And where these women like to go.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,160
What is this place we're going to?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
That's right.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,720
Today we are going to a beauty spa.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
All right.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,800
So let's check that out in today's vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
All right.

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,640
So this place, a beauty spa, it's interesting because it's not just a normal spa.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,240
It's a particular spa where you get treated for some things.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
That's right.

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,560
So a beauty spa is a place where you go to feel good.

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,600
So women and men like to have their nails and their faces and their skin taken care

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
of.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,140
Maybe their makeup and hair as well.

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,280
So it's not just a place where you maybe go for a massage, but you get a lot of other

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,560
services that make your skin nice, make you look and feel good.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
All right.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
So that's where we're going today.

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,320
So beauty spa, and we're going to talk about all the different things that you can do there.

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:10,200
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very first time.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
You want to go get a facial with me today?

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,720
Dude, what are you talking about?

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,040
Only girls do that.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Not at all.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,520
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,440
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
True.

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,520
So what do they do to you at your beauty spa?

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,400
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,600
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,680
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,280
Well, you should come with me one day.

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm sure you'll love it.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Uh, no.

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
All right.

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
We're back.

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,920
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Language takeaway.

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,000
Got a lot of great phrases and words in language takeaway today.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,360
The first one though is from the very first line of dialogue.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
You want to go get a facial with me today?

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
That's right.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,040
We are asking our friend if he wants to go with us to go get a facial.

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,600
Now what exactly does it mean to get a facial?

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,880
All right, a facial here is a thing, in this case, a service that we would pay for.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,880
And basically a facial is just a skincare treatment or a treatment for your face.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,040
So maybe you'll get some cream and cleansing and, uh, you know, in the advertisements you

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,560
often see someone getting a facial with like cucumbers on their eyes.

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
And so it's just a way to make your skin feel really good.

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay.

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Particularly on your face.

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Yes.

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Your face.

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
And the verb here is to get.

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,200
So I'm going to get a facial or I got a facial yesterday.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Okay.

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Very good.

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,680
Now, um, we, apart from getting a facial, getting a special treatment on your face,

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
you can also get a manicure and a pedicure.

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
That's right.

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,480
So manicure, pedicure, these we're going to keep together because they're very similar,

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,040
but they're a little bit different.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,840
Manny, manicure, Manny, that means something to do with the hands.

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,640
So manicure is actually when you have your fingernails kind of cleaned and taken care

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,040
of and then they will apply some paint.

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
So nail polish.

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,240
So basically having your nails treated and then colored.

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay.

76
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,840
And then pedicure I imagine is the same thing, but for your feet.

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
That's right.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Pedi refers to feet.

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,200
So pedicure is the same treatment, the same service, but for your toes.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,720
And in this case you'd have very, you know, nice nail polish on your toes.

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
All right.

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,800
Now, going back to skin treatment, because well, manicure and pedicure for your fingernails

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:53,160
and for your hands and feet, we are talking about getting your face exfoliated or he says,

84
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,320
well, first they exfoliate my face.

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,640
So exfoliate, you think exfoliate means taking something away.

86
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,720
In this case to exfoliate means to take the dead skin away.

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,560
And sometimes this can be a little bit painful because you think at first you have some dry

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,600
skin, some dead skin, they have to take it away.

89
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,480
They have to use something rough.

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,240
You can do it on your feet as well.

91
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,400
But when they exfoliate your face, they use some kind of cleanser or some kind of maybe

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,320
sponge to clear the dead skin.

93
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,920
And then afterwards you have the fresh new skin and it's very smooth and nice looking.

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Okay.

95
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,800
So that's what it means to exfoliate the skin.

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,920
It can be on your face, your feet, pretty much anywhere in your body.

97
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,040
And lastly, we also are just using sunscreen during the day to protect our skin and to

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
keep it healthy.

99
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
That's right.

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,920
So sunscreen is a kind of cream.

101
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Do you use sunscreen, Marco?

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
No.

103
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
No, you don't have to.

104
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
No, never.

105
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,640
Well, I often use sunscreen because I'm very, very pale.

106
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,920
And so when I go in the sun, maybe at the beach, it's very easy for me to burn my skin

107
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,420
to turn red.

108
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,920
And so sunscreen helps me protect my skin.

109
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
So that's exactly what it does.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Sunscreen is a specific type of lotion that you put on your skin and it prevents you from

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,720
getting sunburns or from darkening your skin.

112
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
That's right.

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,940
So those are the words we have relating to skincare and some of these services at the

114
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
beauty spa.

115
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,400
But we've got some more phrases for you.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,440
So let's first listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a moment.

117
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,200
You want to go get a facial with me today?

118
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,920
Dude, what are you talking about?

119
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,480
Only girls do that.

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Not at all.

121
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

122
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,880
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

123
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
True.

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,960
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,840
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

127
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,040
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

128
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,080
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,200
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

130
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,720
Well, you should come with me one day.

131
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm sure you'll love it.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Uh, no.

133
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,420
All right.

134
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,760
So now it's time for some fluency builder.

135
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's check out three key phrases.

136
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
Fluency builder.

137
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,920
So we've got this first phrase here, not at all.

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,480
So one person says only girls go to the beauty spa and what does the other person say?

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Right?

140
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
He says, no, not at all.

141
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Not at all.

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,360
So basically he's responding by saying, no, that's not true.

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
Now you could have said no, but why do you say not at all?

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,520
You can say no, but no is almost rude.

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,140
Not at all is a way to say, actually in reality, this is different.

146
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,160
So it's a, it's a more polite way of disagreeing with what the person just said.

147
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Okay.

148
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
So you can say no, not at all.

149
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,960
I guess you can say both, right?

150
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,480
Not at all or together.

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,080
No, not at all.

152
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,480
No, not at all.

153
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,120
You could say, um, women don't like to watch football and you can say, oh, not at all.

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,520
You could say only men like to watch football.

155
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Right?

156
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,400
And then if I disagree or you say, actually, I can say, no, not at all.

157
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,680
Actually girls like to watch football as well.

158
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
That's right.

159
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Okay.

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,240
So now continuing on with the skincare topic, we saw this interesting verb, to apply some

161
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
moisturizer.

162
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,600
So the verb here is to apply something on your skin.

163
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
All right.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,040
So the verb to apply means to put on, okay.

165
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,520
Or to use.

166
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,000
And this is a verb we often use with beauty care products, like apply the shampoo to your

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
head or apply some fingernail polish.

168
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,600
Means that you're going to, yeah, to put it on yourself.

169
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Right.

170
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,400
So when we say apply some moisturizer is to use moisturizer.

171
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,040
Yeah, to put it on your skin.

172
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Like I apply my makeup, that means I put the makeup on my skin.

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,360
So in this case, moisturizer is a great cream that we use when our skin is dry and we want

174
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,520
it to be more healthy.

175
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,720
We want it to be less dry and we add this.

176
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Okay.

177
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,960
And lastly, after you exfoliate, you apply moisturizer, you do everything.

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,480
He says that you leave the beauty salon feeling like a million bucks.

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
All right.

180
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
To feel like a million bucks.

181
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,320
This is a phrase that we often use to say you feel wonderful.

182
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Feel great.

183
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
You feel really good.

184
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,520
And so this is the main reason to go to the beauty spa, right Marco?

185
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Right.

186
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,840
So you go there because you want to feel like a million bucks.

187
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,360
So you feel very, very, very good.

188
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,680
Sometimes when I buy a new outfit and I try it on, I'm really excited.

189
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,240
I say, Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

190
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,080
So I guess the other form of this word will actually be, you look like a million bucks.

191
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
Someone can look like a million bucks.

192
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Exactly.

193
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,360
So I see my friend coming from the beauty spa and I say, wow, you look like a million

194
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
bucks.

195
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
You look great.

196
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
All right.

197
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
So let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

198
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's review everything and we'll be back in a bit.

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,240
You want to go get a facial with me today?

200
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Dude, what are you talking about?

201
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
Only girls do that.

202
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Not at all.

203
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures.

204
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,880
There's nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

205
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
True.

206
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
So what should they do to you at your beauty spa?

207
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,800
Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.

208
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,240
Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young.

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,000
Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,040
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in.

211
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,120
In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.

212
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,640
Well, you should come with me one day.

213
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,040
I'm sure you'll love it.

214
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Uh, no.

215
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,480
All right.

216
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,280
So facials, this sort of thing is commonly mostly associated with women.

217
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,040
But as we saw in the dialogue, more and more men are actually taking care of their skin

218
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,600
and their appearance.

219
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
That's right.

220
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,560
This might have been traditionally a woman's event, going to the spa, having a girl's day

221
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
at the spa.

222
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
You're right, Marco.

223
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,040
A lot of men like to do this.

224
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,600
Just because you get a manicure doesn't mean you have to have pink fingernails.

225
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,720
You can actually just have your nails taken care of and cleaned and cut and your cuticles

226
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
taken care of.

227
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,320
So it feels really nice.

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
That's right.

229
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,600
Actually, it's a common new trend that we've even heard in the news about.

230
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:36,760
And the term that men are labeled with when they take excessive care of their skin and

231
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
their appearance, they say they're metrosexuals.

232
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Metrosexual.

233
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Right.

234
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,800
Now, this is a man who, like you say, likes to dress nicely, takes care of his hair, has

235
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,700
nice skin, someone who really takes care of their body.

236
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,960
And it's different from being a homosexual, for example, where maybe that's a stereotype

237
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,240
that we have, where we say, oh, well, some people who are homosexual like to dress very

238
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,960
well and take care of their skin.

239
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Metrosexual people, men, are straight.

240
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
They're not gay.

241
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,200
But they still like to do these things, to go to the spa or to take care of their appearances.

242
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Right.

243
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,840
So it's a very interesting topic, specifically nowadays, where this type of thing is more

244
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
and more common.

245
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,800
And yet still in many places and cultures, it's very much taboo.

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,960
Obviously, being manly man associated with that is, you know, you don't really take care

247
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
of your appearance.

248
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,480
You know, you wake up and you still look kind of messy and half asleep or, you know, guy

249
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,080
has scars and beards and stuff.

250
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,880
So you don't really associate it much.

251
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,760
But it's very interesting to see these types of different cultural aspects.

252
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,880
So we would like to know if in your culture, your country, this is a common practice.

253
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,840
Is it acceptable or is it very, very rare?

254
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,360
And if you go to the beauty spa, whether you're a man or a woman, what's your favorite service?

255
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Do you like the facials?

256
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Do you like the pedicures?

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Let us know.

258
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

259
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
All right.

260
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
We'll see you guys there.

261
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Bye.
