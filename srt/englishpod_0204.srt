00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,960
My name is Catherine and today we have a very dramatic intermediate level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
That's right.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
Today we're going to take a look at how a court works, for example in the United States.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,280
So you see that in movies and TV shows a lot, you know, the judge and all that.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
That's right.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,040
Many of you have seen the movie The Firm or 12 Angry Men.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,160
These are classics in courtroom dramas we say.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,760
So today we're in a courtroom and there are many characters who are trying to determine

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,040
if this person is innocent or guilty.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,680
So let's take a listen and find out what's going on.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,840
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client Robert Malone has been accused of

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,200
a crime he did not commit.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,720
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,920
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,680
People who claim the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,680
I feel sorry for these victims.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,480
I really do.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,840
But my client is innocent.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,580
Let's look at the facts.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:25,080
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,840
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,320
There is no evidence.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,360
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,740
your verdict.

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,200
Look at the facts.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,240
Look at the evidence.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,920
My client is innocent.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,720
Yes, Your Honor.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
Our verdict is not guilty.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
Thank you so much.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
You were great.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,120
Thank you for all your hard work.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
You're welcome, Robert.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,000
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,080
Take care of yourself, okay?

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,760
Thanks once again.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Hey, where's my wallet?

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
All right, we're back.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,360
So you probably heard a lot of technical words that are specifically related to the courtroom,

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,560
to lawyers, and the laws.

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,760
So why don't we take a look at some of those now in Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,720
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,960
The first Language Takeaway we're looking at today is all about people.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,360
So people you will find in a courtroom.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Who's the first person on our list, Marco?

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,760
So the top person would be the judge.

50
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,040
Now you didn't really see this word judge in the dialogue, right?

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,800
You did hear though the phrase, Your Honor.

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Your Honor.

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,360
So Your Honor.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,600
So that's how you talk to a judge.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
You always add Your Honor before it or something like that?

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
That's right.

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,840
So you know we say Mr. President when we're talking to Barack Obama.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,200
But if we're talking to a judge, he's a special person in American society.

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,760
So we call him or her Your Honor.

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Your Honor.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Okay.

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
So we have the judge.

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
That's our first person.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,880
Who else do we have?

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,280
So we have the judge and now we have a group of 12 people who will ultimately decide if

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,400
the person is guilty or not.

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
That's right.

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
So these people are normal.

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,840
They come from all different parts of society and they will decide what to do with this

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
person.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,560
Is he guilty or is she innocent?

72
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,160
This group is called the jury.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,880
So the jury is a group of normal citizens who will listen to both sides of the story

74
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,280
and will then decide if the person committed the crime or didn't commit the crime.

75
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
That's right.

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
A jury.

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
And the big question is, who's fighting?

78
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
We have two sides.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,040
Someone who is upset and someone who is defending themselves.

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,560
The person who is upset, this is the prosecution.

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Okay.

82
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,540
So the prosecution has a group of lawyers that are called the prosecutors, right?

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
That's right.

84
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,520
And they're trying to prove that that person committed the crime.

85
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,120
For example, I say that Marco burned down my house.

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,080
I go to court, I say I am the prosecution.

87
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,420
I want him to pay me for my house.

88
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,920
So I'm the prosecution.

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Okay.

90
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,480
So you're trying to not only prove that I committed the crime, but also trying to get

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,960
me to pay for the damage that I caused.

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Exactly.

93
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,120
So in this case, the prosecution says, this man stole my wallet.

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,680
He's a pickpocket.

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,000
And who's the pickpocket?

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or maybe the pickpocket.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,480
Who's the other side of this?

98
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
The defendant.

99
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Defend, defendant.

100
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,800
Think about the word here.

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,380
To defend is to stand up for yourself, to protect yourself.

102
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,320
So the defendant says, listen, no, that's not true.

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,720
I am not a pickpocket.

104
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,140
I didn't do that.

105
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,080
So we have the prosecution and the defense.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,720
And the person who might be guilty, the person who did the thing or didn't do the thing,

107
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,880
is called the defendant.

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,800
So in your example again about the crime that maybe I burnt your house down or I didn't,

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,000
I would be the defendant and my lawyers would constitute my defense.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
Yeah, they are your defense.

111
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Okay.

112
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,240
So very technical words, but the important thing to remember here is defendant.

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
All right.

114
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Good.

115
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,780
So now we have one key element that is also a person.

116
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,640
We have the witness.

117
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,960
All right, so the basic idea like you said is we have to tell a story.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,000
My story is that you burned down my house.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And you say, no, I didn't.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Prove it.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
I say, I can.

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,120
Someone saw you with a lighter.

123
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,960
So this person is my witness.

124
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,240
That means that he or she saw what happened.

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,840
So someone who sees a crime is a witness to that crime.

126
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,660
Okay, very good.

127
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,700
So a lot of people are in the courtroom.

128
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,440
A lot of things are happening.

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,040
So I think we should listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to look at some more

130
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,840
words on Language Takeaway Part 2.

131
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,000
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client Robert Malone has been accused of

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,360
a crime he did not commit.

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,760
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,040
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

135
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,760
People who claim the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

136
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
I feel sorry for these victims.

137
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,560
I really do.

138
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,920
But my client is innocent.

139
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,680
Let's look at the facts.

140
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:52,160
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

141
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,920
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

142
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,600
There is no evidence.

143
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving

144
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,800
your verdict.

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
Look at the facts.

146
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,320
Look at the evidence.

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,040
My client is innocent.

148
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,160
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

149
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,880
Yes, Your Honor.

150
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,600
Our verdict is not guilty.

151
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you so much.

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
You were great.

153
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,440
Thank you for all your hard work.

154
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
You're welcome, Robert.

155
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,320
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,400
Take care of yourself, okay?

157
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
Thanks once again.

158
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,280
Hey, where's my wallet?

159
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,160
I love it when we do this.

160
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
So many words.

161
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,040
So much language to take away.

162
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
That's right.

163
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,800
So now we're going to take a look at the second part of language takeaway where we have another

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,660
set of four words that we want to take a look at.

165
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Language takeaway.

166
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
All right.

167
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,540
The first is actually two words.

168
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
We have two opposites.

169
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Okay?

170
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,440
So you said earlier, the jury has to make a decision.

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,000
The jury has to decide, is the defendant innocent or guilty?

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,320
These are two important adjectives.

174
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Innocent.

175
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
What does this mean?

176
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,120
So if he is innocent, that means he did not commit the crime.

177
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,600
He is not responsible for what happened.

178
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
He did not steal the wallets.

179
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Okay.

180
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,920
So we often say babies are so innocent.

181
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Right.

182
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
They can't do anything.

183
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
They can't do anything wrong.

184
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Right.

185
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,400
So guilty would be the opposite.

186
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
That's right.

187
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,840
So usually when someone is guilty, they're sad, they feel bad, you want them to pay you.

188
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
And they go to jail.

189
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Yeah.

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,640
In bad situations, they go to jail.

191
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,840
If you burn down my house, of course you're going to go to jail.

192
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Right.

193
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
All right.

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
So guilty means you did a crime.

195
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,440
You did a bad thing.

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,880
So we talked about the prosecution and the defense of the defendant.

197
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,320
And what happens is they also present some key elements that will prove if the person

198
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
is innocent or guilty.

199
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,560
And those elements are called evidence.

200
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
That's right.

201
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
So back to this idea, we tell a story.

202
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
Maybe a witness can help us tell our story.

203
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,160
But as you say, evidence is stuff.

204
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
It's things.

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,280
So in the case of the house, I could say you have matches and you smell like smoke and

206
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
oil.

207
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,440
This is evidence for me to use to show that you are guilty.

208
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Right.

209
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,520
So in this case, do we have any evidence?

210
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,720
There's no evidence, says the defendant.

211
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Right.

212
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
All right.

213
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
So evidence is proof.

214
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,400
It's physical proof.

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah.

216
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,640
And most of the times when you see movies or TV shows, they will find, I don't know,

217
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,240
like maybe a fingerprint that's evidence or somebody's glasses.

218
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
A cell phone.

219
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Exactly.

220
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
All right.

221
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
So evidence.

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,960
This is very important when you want to build a case.

223
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Finally, at the end of a trial, we have a verdict.

224
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,320
Now, what is a verdict?

225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,000
Well a verdict is a final decision or a conclusion in which the jury says, yeah, the person is

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,960
guilty or he's not guilty, he's innocent.

227
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,360
So we use this word usually to reach a verdict.

228
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,480
The jury reaches a verdict.

229
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,760
Now it's interesting why we say to reach because a jury is not just one person.

230
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
A jury is many people.

231
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,080
And so these people have to decide together.

232
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,220
They have to argue.

233
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,520
They have to make a conclusion that everyone agrees on.

234
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,720
And this is to reach a conclusion, to reach a verdict because they have to travel there.

235
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,880
They have to go together and figure it out.

236
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Right.

237
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
That's very, very important.

238
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,220
So the jury reaches a verdict.

239
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,440
And we did have one other phrase that's very interesting.

240
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,520
It doesn't quite fit with the other ones.

241
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
We heard this phrase from the defendant.

242
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,680
The lawyer says, so these so-called witnesses didn't actually see anything.

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,800
What is so-called?

244
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,440
So he's being sarcastic when he uses this phrase, so-called, right?

245
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,760
That's why even his tone changes, these so-called witnesses.

246
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,880
So it's a way of expressing sarcasm.

247
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,440
He's saying they say they're witnesses, but they're not really because they didn't see

248
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
anything.

249
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Right.

250
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
So so-called means you say that they are, but they're not really.

251
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Right.

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,960
I could also say, your so-called lawyer thinks he can help you, but he can't.

253
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Right.

254
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,940
That means I don't think your lawyer is very good.

255
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,400
I don't think he's a real lawyer.

256
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Right.

257
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,840
Or sometimes people say, my so-called friend stood me up last night.

258
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Oh, so it's not really a friend.

259
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
He's not really a friend.

260
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Exactly.

261
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
So-called.

262
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
All right.

263
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
That's another good one.

264
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one more time.

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,040
Really think about some of the words you heard today, and we'll be back in a moment.

266
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

267
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,560
My client, Robert Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit.

268
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,040
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

269
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,240
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

270
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,000
People who claim the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I feel sorry for these victims.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
I really do.

273
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,180
But my client is innocent.

274
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,920
Let's look at the facts.

275
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:15,400
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

276
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,160
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

277
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,760
There is no evidence.

278
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,680
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving

279
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,060
your verdict.

280
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,520
Look at the facts.

281
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,560
Look at the evidence.

282
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,240
My client is innocent.

283
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

284
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,040
Yes, Your Honor.

285
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,640
Our verdict is not guilty.

286
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,020
Thank you so much.

287
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
You were great.

288
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,440
Thank you for all your hard work.

289
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,520
You're welcome, Robert.

290
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,340
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

291
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,400
Take care of yourself, okay?

292
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Thanks once again.

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,520
Hey, where's my wallet?

294
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,280
All right, we're back.

295
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,500
So now a very interesting situation with the courtroom dramas.

296
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,520
And I've heard that all the people in the jury have to agree in order for them to reach

297
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
a verdict, right?

298
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,280
So if one of them is not convinced that the person is, for example, guilty, then they

299
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
have to keep on deliberating.

300
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
That's the word, right?

301
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
That's right.

302
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,500
So basically, the jury is always alone in a room.

303
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,360
Maybe they have a guard, but they're not supposed to talk to journalists or friends of the defendant

304
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,880
or anyone because their decision is supposed to be pure.

305
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,000
So they talk, and sometimes it takes 10 minutes.

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,840
Everyone agrees this person is guilty or this person is innocent.

307
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
But sometimes they don't agree.

308
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,520
And it can be one day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month trying to decide what to do.

309
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,320
I remember in the OJ Simpson case, the jury took a long time to figure out what they were

310
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
going to do.

311
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,360
And they said that the jury are common citizens.

312
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
They're normal people.

313
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,880
So what happens in their jobs if they can't go to work because they're doing this?

314
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,140
Well, in America, this job is called jury duty.

315
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,380
And so someone will send you a letter, and they say, listen, you need to come do jury

316
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,160
duty and you help be a part of the jury.

317
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,000
And your job, they can't make you come because this is a service for the government.

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320
So it's above everything else.

319
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
It's above.

320
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
You get your normal pay.

321
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
There's no problem.

322
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
But it just don't work.

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Okay.

324
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,720
So they can't fire you if you're in jury duty for like five days or a month or whatever.

325
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
No, they can't.

326
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
That's illegal.

327
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Wow.

328
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
That's really interesting.

329
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
But a lot of people I've heard don't like to go to jury duty for some reason.

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is it tedious?

331
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,240
No, it's probably very boring.

332
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,520
I've never done it, but it's probably very boring.

333
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,080
I would imagine so.

334
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
All right.

335
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,440
Well, that's a very interesting topic.

336
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,220
I'm sure in your countries, laws are handled differently.

337
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,580
Maybe you don't have a courtroom.

338
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,760
Maybe you have like in England, people wear wigs.

339
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,400
And black robes.

340
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,240
So let us know how it works in your countries.

341
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,600
We'll see everyone at our website EnglishPod.com.

342
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,760
And of course, if you have any questions or comments, you can leave those there as well.

343
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,440
See you on the website and happy studies.

344
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:31,000
Bye everyone.
