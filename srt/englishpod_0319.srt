00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,040
My name is Catherine and today we have another episode in our series about small talk.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,380
So small talk Marco is what exactly?

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,960
Quick little conversation that you have maybe with a colleague or friend or even with a

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,940
stranger maybe in the elevator.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,560
Just about the weather or some small little topic.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
So you're not talking about the meaning of life.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,280
You're talking about the weather or food.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,720
So let's check out today's dialogue and we'll be back in a minute to talk more about what's

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,560
going on.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:43,920
Oh dear miss, you are soaked.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
Wow, it's really raining heavily outside.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,240
Yes, it sure is.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,300
I had to run here from work.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,080
I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,640
Well please, why don't you go ahead of me in line.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm in no hurry.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,400
Oh, that's so nice of you.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Thank you very much.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
My pleasure miss.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,040
Actually, could you recommend what to eat here?

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,960
I've never been here before.

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Sure.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,400
Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious and it's the healthiest thing on the menu.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,720
Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice.

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,200
I usually get that.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,720
Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
Well, thanks for the suggestions.

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,560
No, don't mention it.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Alright we're back.

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,160
So, as we saw in this dialogue, it's a small talk conversation with two strangers who are

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,960
actually buying some food.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
So this is something that could happen if you are waiting in line at a supermarket,

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,080
if you're at the bank or even at a shop like in this case.

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Exactly.

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
This kind of conversation happens all the time.

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,920
So let's take a look at some words and phrases in today's language takeaway.

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,560
Language takeaway.

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Alright so the first word that we have for you today is the gentleman, the older person,

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,280
noticed how wet the girl was.

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,240
She said you are soaked.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,720
Alright so it's raining outside and he says oh dear miss, you are soaked.

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
Alright this is an adjective.

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,180
It describes what she looks like.

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,800
So if you are soaked, it means that you are a little bit wet?

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Very wet.

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Very wet.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,480
You know you can say that someone is a little wet but if they're soaked, it means their

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
shoes, their pants, their shirt, their hat, everything is very wet.

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,440
Okay, you are soaked.

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,480
And so it's an adjective even though it has an ed ending, it may look like a verb or in

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,040
the past but it's not.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
It's an adjective with an ed ending.

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
That's right.

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,400
So it's raining outside, this woman is very wet, she's soaked, she's wet and she says

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
I have to rush, I have to hurry because of what?

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,800
Because I'm on my lunch break.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,280
She's on her lunch break.

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Okay so during work, we might have something called a break.

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,400
This is a short time when we don't have to work.

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
Five minutes, ten minutes.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,440
And the break that we have at lunch when we get to eat is a little bit longer.

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
So we call this a lunch break.

65
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
That's right.

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,720
So usually people have their lunch break let's say at noon or one o'clock and it's usually

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
an hour like you say.

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
That's right, an hour.

69
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,160
Okay so she's on her lunch break and that's why she's in a hurry and so the other guy

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,720
let her go in front of him and he asked her for some suggestions.

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
What is good here?

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,280
What do you recommend to eat?

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
That's right.

74
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
So he's not familiar with the food but the woman is and she says well, the avocado sandwich

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
is delicious.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,900
Now let's talk about this fruit because it is a fruit, right Marco?

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,280
It's a fruit, an avocado.

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
You see this, it looks like a big green pear more or less.

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
That's right.

80
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,600
Well it's green on the inside and it's dark on the outside.

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,080
So to eat it, you have to take off the skin.

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,320
Yeah, that's right.

83
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,560
And inside it's kind of buttery almost.

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not hard like a banana or an apple.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,680
It's kind of more very, very soft.

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
You can take it out with a spoon.

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
That's right.

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,520
It's very, very delicious and it's very common in a lot of Latin cooking where you have for

89
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,680
example guacamole in Mexican cooking which is made primarily of avocados.

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,860
That's right.

91
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,080
So she recommends the avocado sandwich and then she goes on to describe some of the food

92
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,200
and now here, we're going to take a look at some adjectives but in a superlative form.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,240
For example, she said it's the healthiest thing on the menu, this sandwich.

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Okay, so this is a really important point Marco and I'm glad you brought it up.

95
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,920
I can say that this food is healthy.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,940
That means it's good for my body.

97
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,840
But if I say that it's the healthiest, what does that mean?

98
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
How is that different from healthy?

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,200
Usually you're saying that it's on the list of things that are at the restaurant maybe

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
that are healthy.

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,540
This is the most healthy.

102
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,240
But you don't say most healthy.

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
You say healthiest.

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,880
Healthiest, okay.

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,400
So is chocolate cake the healthiest thing on the menu?

106
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
No, probably not.

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
It's probably the least healthy.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
So on top we have the healthiest thing on the menu.

109
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,480
We also have another superlative.

110
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,120
We heard the word tastiest.

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Right.

112
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,920
This comes from the adjective tasty.

113
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Something is delicious.

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
It's tasty.

115
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
It's good.

116
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,080
But here we're saying that it's the thing that tastes the best, the tastiest choice.

117
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,880
Okay, so I think that the avocado sandwich is the tastiest.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,800
That means I think it's the best thing you can eat.

119
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,280
And that's another one actually.

120
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,880
Best is another superlative but it's a little bit different because it's not an is, is,

121
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
is.

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Right.

123
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,080
It's not like tastiest or healthiest.

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
It's just best.

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Right.

126
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,940
You're saying that it's the number one.

127
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,560
So the best milkshake in town like in this dialogue.

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
Or you say the best soccer player in the world is so and so.

129
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,040
Alright, so this comes from the adjective good.

130
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,480
So we have good which is not bad and the best which is the most good, right?

131
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Yeah, exactly.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
But you don't say the most good.

133
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
You say the best.

134
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
He's the best.

135
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,680
So maybe Ronaldo is one of the best soccer players in the world.

136
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Exactly.

137
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Alright.

138
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
So now let's take a break.

139
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,400
Let's take a look at everything again and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Oh, dear miss, you are soaked.

141
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,240
Wow, it's really raining heavily outside.

142
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes, it sure is.

143
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,240
I had to run here from work.

144
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,560
I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break.

145
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Well, please, why don't you go ahead of me in line?

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm in no hurry.

147
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,320
Oh, that's so nice of you.

148
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Thank you very much.

149
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,680
My pleasure, miss.

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,960
Actually, could you recommend what to eat here?

151
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
I've never been here before.

152
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Sure.

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,320
Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious and it's the healthiest thing on the menu.

154
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice.

155
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,080
I usually get that.

156
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,600
Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town.

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Well, thanks for the suggestions.

158
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,320
Don't mention it.

159
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,080
All right, we're back so now let's take a look at three phrases we picked out on Fluency

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,280
Builder.

161
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Fluency Builder.

162
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,960
So, we have a great phrase here, something that we often hear in conversation, polite

163
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
conversations.

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,560
The older man says, I'm in no hurry.

165
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,200
Now, what does this mean?

166
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,760
Does this mean he needs to go somewhere?

167
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,080
No, he says, you know what?

168
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,480
I really don't have to go anywhere fast.

169
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,440
That's why he let her, the girl, get in front of him in line at the shop.

170
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
All right, so basically it means I can wait.

171
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I can wait, yeah.

172
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,480
So, if somebody says, oh, I'll be right back.

173
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Please wait a moment.

174
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
You can say, I'm in no hurry.

175
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Take your time.

176
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,880
Okay, so I'm in no hurry means it's not that important.

177
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
I don't have to go fast.

178
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,080
Right, but if you change the no and you say, I'm in a hurry, then that means that you have

179
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
to go fast.

180
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Come on, Marco.

181
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Speed it up.

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm in a hurry.

183
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
I'm in a hurry.

184
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Okay.

185
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Yes.

186
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
So, just changing those two words, that gives you a completely different meaning.

187
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
And well, the girl, Michelle, she said, oh, that's so nice of you.

188
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Thank you very much.

189
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
And he says, my pleasure.

190
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,960
All right, so this is an alternative to the phrase, you're welcome.

191
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
This is a very polite way to say you're welcome.

192
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,600
And so, when we hear her thank him for something, you know, thank you for letting me go ahead

193
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,640
of you, he says, my pleasure.

194
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,720
This is a great, great phrase for you guys.

195
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Exactly.

196
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,360
So, now you have another alternative instead of saying, you're welcome or no problem or

197
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,760
don't mention it.

198
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,280
Now you have, it's my pleasure.

199
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,800
This is a little bit more formal, but you can use it in any circumstance.

200
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
That's right.

201
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,760
And as I said, another option here is the phrase, don't mention it, which means exactly

202
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
the same thing.

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
You're welcome.

204
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
That's right.

205
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,560
So, the older gentleman says, thanks for the suggestions.

206
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,160
Thanks for your help.

207
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,920
And what does the young woman say?

208
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Don't mention it.

209
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Don't mention it.

210
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,080
So, this is more colloquial.

211
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,240
This is a little bit more spoken language.

212
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,600
She's saying, no problem.

213
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
You're welcome.

214
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
That's right.

215
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
So, you have, you're welcome, no problem, my pleasure, don't mention it.

216
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,840
All ways of saying the same thing.

217
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
All right.

218
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
So, let's take another listen to our dialogue.

219
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
We'll be back in a moment.

220
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Oh, dear miss, you are soaked.

221
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,320
Wow, it's really raining heavily outside.

222
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Yes, it sure is.

223
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
I had to run here from work.

224
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,640
I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break.

225
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,680
Well, please, why don't you go ahead of me in line?

226
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm in no hurry.

227
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, that's so nice of you.

228
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Thank you very much.

229
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,880
My pleasure, miss.

230
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
Actually, could you recommend what to eat here?

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,960
I've never been here before.

232
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Sure.

233
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,440
Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious and it's the healthiest thing on the menu.

234
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice.

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
I usually get that.

236
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,720
Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town.

237
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,360
Wow, thanks for the suggestions.

238
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,120
No, don't mention it.

239
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,040
All right, we're back.

240
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,760
So, talking about the superlatives, I know it's a complicated subject because grammar-wise,

241
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,400
it can be a little bit difficult to determine when do you say, for example, beautiful.

242
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,480
Do you say more beautiful or do you say beautiful-est?

243
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
You say more beautiful.

244
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
That's right.

245
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,720
Well, I don't really have a hard and fast rule for everyone.

246
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,760
It's one of those things that you learn while you're studying English and you just have

247
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
to remember.

248
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,200
Yes, there are some exceptions, but usually you can guide yourself by adjectives that

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,080
have usually three or more syllables.

250
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,040
You probably have to use most or more.

251
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Amazing.

252
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
Right, you don't say amazing-est.

253
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Most amazing.

254
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,640
Most amazing or more amazing.

255
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,160
What about funny?

256
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Funny.

257
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,920
Often you say funnier or funniest.

258
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
Or sad.

259
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
You can say saddest.

260
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,880
All right, so sad, funny, these are one and two syllables, sad, funny, saddest, funniest,

261
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,360
you can use this ending.

262
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,400
But with the words like beautiful or amazing, there are three syllables, they're long, you

263
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,080
have to say most amazing, most beautiful.

264
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,840
Yeah, and there are some exceptions to the rule, you may find them, but usually if you

265
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,520
see an adjective that's a little bit long like this, you can just say, you can just

266
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,640
use more for the comparative or most for the superlative.

267
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,080
All right, so lots of stuff there.

268
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,640
I recommend that you guys go check out the dialogue and expansion sentences we have for

269
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
today.

270
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

271
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
All right, we'll see you guys there.

272
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Bye.

273
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:46,400
Basically we're looking at the phase回去 we talked about, the phase word here.

274
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,800
So the words回來, come back here and then we say back, come back here, come.

275
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Right?

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Okay.

277
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Bye.
