00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,840
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,120
And today we're going to be in one of my favorite sporting events, which is?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,680
F1, of course.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,960
F1 racing, alright.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,860
So yeah, we're going to be talking about racing, specifically F1, which is a very popular sport

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,860
all over the world.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,320
Yeah, I think maybe it's like number two in popularity after soccer.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,440
Yeah, I think so.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,240
I have no numbers to back that up though.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,480
Well they do travel everywhere, they have races all over the world and just people love

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
it.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Well, it is kind of a cool thing.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,560
Well, going 300 kilometers per hour in a car is pretty cool.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,480
Alright, so let's not delay this any longer.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:56,320
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,560
Welcome back racing fans, my name is Rick Fields and as always I'm joined by my partner

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,680
in crime, Bob Copeland.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
with only four laps to go.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,560
They're heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a close one and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,040
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,240
We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,240
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,040
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,200
Smoke is coming out of his car.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,440
He seems to be having engine trouble.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,960
He makes his way under the pit and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,840
How unlucky for Raikonen and this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:52,240
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,000
What an exciting race.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,120
I always love a good crash when it comes to car races.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,880
I think many people go to races expecting to see a crash.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,600
They don't want to see people getting hurt.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
No, but a little bit of...

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,280
The emotion of just car crashes and stuff.

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Yeah, a little explosion here and there.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Alright.

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,160
So, now we saw some really exciting language related to racing.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,480
So why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,440
Alright, so we were talking about that crash and I think what led to the crash was the

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
driver jammed on the brakes.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Right.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,440
He jammed on the brakes.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
To jam on the brakes.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Okay.

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,680
Now, if I jam on the brakes...

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,160
You push the brakes really, really hard and really quickly and really suddenly.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Right.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
So you jam on the brakes and you stop very quickly.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,520
So Lewis Hamilton jammed on the brakes and consequently spun out.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
To spin out.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Okay.

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
In the present, it would be spin out.

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Spin out.

59
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Okay.

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,800
So, imagine yourselves driving your car on a very wet road.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,320
And then you jam on the brakes.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Right.

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,080
So then the car, you kind of lose control of the car and it starts to spin.

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
It goes in circles.

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Uh-huh.

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
That would be to spin out.

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,160
This has actually happened to me more than once.

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
Really?

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Yeah.

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Were you okay?

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah, I was fine.

72
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
I was fine.

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Okay.

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
So, the car spun out.

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,720
Now, in racing, you always see this really cool car come out and be ahead of everyone

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,840
when there's an accident.

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Right.

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
That's called the pace car.

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
The pace car.

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Pace car.

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,020
Now, why is it called the pace car?

82
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,600
Because it sets the pace.

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Okay.

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
The pace or the speed.

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Uh-huh.

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
So, pace means speed.

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Uh-huh.

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,360
So, the car spun out and no other car can pass it.

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,880
Everyone must go at the same speed.

90
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Right.

91
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
The pace car.

92
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Pace car.

93
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
All right.

94
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,280
So, after there's an accident, the cleanup crew must come out.

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Okay.

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Cleanup crew.

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Cleanup crew.

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
All right.

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,200
So, crew, this is an interesting word.

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Uh-huh.

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,120
When we talk about a crew, we talk about a group of people who work together.

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Okay.

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,300
But, for example, in an office, can I have a crew?

104
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Not really.

105
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Not commonly, right?

106
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Yeah.

107
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,280
People work together and they use their hands to work.

108
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,560
They do manual labor.

109
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Okay.

110
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,760
So, I can say, for example, a construction crew.

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
That's right.

112
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,920
Or maybe the ground crew at the airport.

113
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Okay.

114
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
Or the flight crew.

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Also at the airport.

116
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
All right.

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Well, in the airplane.

118
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
So, that's a crew.

119
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Uh-huh.

120
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
So, cleanup crew.

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Cleanup crew.

122
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,600
Now, they came out to take that car away, that broken or damaged vehicle.

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,120
So, they were towing it.

124
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Tow.

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay.

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
The verb to tow.

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
To tow.

128
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,680
So, what does it mean when you tow something or you tow a car?

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,720
You pull something behind you.

130
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,680
So, if you're a truck, that might pull a car behind you.

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
That's a tow truck.

132
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
A tow truck.

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Uh-huh.

134
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,320
Now, this happens commonly if you park your vehicle where you are not supposed to.

135
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
That's right.

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
And your car will get towed.

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Your car gets towed.

138
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Yeah.

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Very good.

140
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
All right.

141
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,800
So, we saw five really great words related to racing.

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,880
And now, why don't we listen to our dialogue again and then we'll look at some other interesting

143
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:24,560
phrases.

144
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,440
Welcome back, race fans.

145
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
My name is Rick Fields.

146
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,320
And as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,480
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race.

148
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,760
And Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

149
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,240
They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,480
It's a close one and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

151
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,600
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out.

152
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,760
We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track.

153
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,200
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

154
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,080
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

155
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,520
Smoke is coming out of his car.

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
He seems to be having engine trouble.

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,280
He makes his way into the pit and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

158
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,160
How unlucky for Raikonen.

159
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
And this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,040
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

161
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,060
Okay.

162
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,800
So now we're back and I think it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in FluencyBuilder.

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Fluency Builder.

164
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,320
Well, even though we're talking about F1 racing, a lot of the language can be used

165
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,960
in many different situations.

166
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,880
So let's look at some of those phrases now.

167
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,240
When Rick Fields introduced his co-host, he said, my partner in crime.

168
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
Partner in crime.

169
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Partner in crime.

170
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,520
Now, it's not that they're actually committing a crime.

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,880
No, they're not actually bank robbers.

172
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,000
But it's a very common and friendly way of saying my good friend or my...

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
The person I do everything with.

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Right, my co-worker, for example.

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,320
But a co-worker who's a really, really good friend, who you spend a lot of time with.

176
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Okay.

177
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,640
So that's your partner in crime.

178
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
It's just a metaphor, right?

179
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
So partner in crime.

180
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,640
Now what about the next phrase?

181
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,400
The last stretch.

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,440
The last stretch.

183
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Last stretch.

184
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,680
Okay, before we explain this word, let's listen to some examples and then we'll come back

185
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,880
and talk about it.

186
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Example one.

187
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,520
We are finally in the last stretch of a very long week.

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,560
I can't wait to go home.

189
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Example two.

190
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,760
He's in the last stretch of his college years and soon he'll graduate.

191
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Okay, so I understand that to mean like the final length of time.

192
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Right.

193
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,600
The last or final moments before an ending.

194
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,520
All right, so the last stretch.

195
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,280
The last stretch.

196
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,160
Now when you're on the last stretch, you just have a few minutes to go.

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
To go.

198
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,440
Yeah, to go.

199
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,400
Now this preposition to and the verb go is very easy, right?

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Right.

201
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,560
But if you say five minutes to go, what does that mean?

202
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Five minutes left.

203
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Left.

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,160
It doesn't mean it's five minutes to actually leave, right?

205
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Right.

206
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,560
It means you must complete five minutes before you can be finished.

207
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Okay.

208
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
So it's not about exiting.

209
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Right.

210
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
I have five days to go before I go on vacation.

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,960
So it's not about you actually going on the vacation, it's about you passing those five

212
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
days.

213
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,520
Can you give us another example?

214
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,560
How about we have 45 minutes to go before the end of the day.

215
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
That's right.

216
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,920
So to go.

217
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Left.

218
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Exactly.

219
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
To go.

220
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
Now let's take a look at our last phrase.

221
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Close one.

222
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
A close one.

223
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
A close one.

224
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
All right.

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
Another interesting phrase made up of simple words.

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,320
So let's listen to some examples to help us understand it.

227
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Example one.

228
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,960
That was a close one.

229
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,580
The teacher almost caught me cheating.

230
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,520
Example two.

231
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
It's a close one.

232
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,040
The sun is up and the tide and the game is almost over.

233
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,200
Example three.

234
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,560
My girlfriend almost found the presents I hid under the bed.

235
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,960
It was a close one.

236
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay.

237
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
So a close one, it means?

238
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,640
A situation that is almost dangerous but wasn't.

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
But wasn't.

240
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Yeah.

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Exactly.

242
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
That was a close one.

243
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Okay.

244
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
So very good phrases.

245
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
I think we can take a lot from this and apply it outside of F1, right?

246
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Yeah.

247
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
All right.

248
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,240
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about

249
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:03,680
this great sport.

250
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Welcome back racing fans.

251
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,040
My name is Rick Fields and as always I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

252
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race and Kimi Raikkonen is leading the pack

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
with only four laps to go.

254
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,920
They're heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikkonen.

255
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,400
It's a close one and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

256
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,440
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out.

257
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,600
We have yellow flag and the pace car is making its way into the track.

258
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

259
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,760
Raikkonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

260
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,560
Smoke is coming out of his car.

261
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,800
He seems to be having engine trouble.

262
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,320
He makes his way under the pit and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

263
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,960
Now unlucky for Raikkonen and this race is over ladies and gentlemen.

264
00:10:46,960 --> 00:11:02,040
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

265
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,520
Alright so F1 racing.

266
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Erika, do you like it?

267
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Do you watch it?

268
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,120
Yeah, F1 is pretty neat.

269
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,520
You know, cars that drive fast, that's pretty interesting.

270
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,320
Well for some people it isn't, right, like why do I want to go to a race and just see

271
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
fast cars?

272
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,080
Okay, I would never go to a race but I think it's, I would maybe watch the highlights on

273
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
TV.

274
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,280
Well actually this year it's really exciting because again we're going to have a night

275
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,440
race, I think it's in Malaysia or somewhere in Asia that they're going to race at night.

276
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,880
So that's pretty special, huh?

277
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Well it's like harder to see and you're going really fast, imagine.

278
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,560
So I hear you're going to the F1 this year.

279
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,440
Yes, this year I'm going to go to the Shanghai circuit to watch the F1 race so I'm really

280
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
excited about that.

281
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,760
I haven't ever been to one so it should be fun.

282
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,880
Alright well I hope you get to see some interesting things like car crashes and pace cars.

283
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,380
What about you guys, our listeners?

284
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,280
Are you fans of F1?

285
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,440
Have you ever been to an F1 race?

286
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,240
Exactly, send us your questions and comments and also your stories.

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,480
Yeah, there was one recently.

294
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Someone, some, something.

295
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
Alright, maybe our users know which one is the Canadian.

296
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
So we'll see you guys there.

297

Bye.

299

You can
