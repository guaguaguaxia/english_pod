00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,740
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,500
And today we're bringing you another sci-fi lesson for all of those fans out there of

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,440
Star Trek and Star Wars.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,440
That's right.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,080
And today we're going to focus on some phrases.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,880
We're not going to do any vocabulary today.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,480
We're just going to learn some phrases that you'll find relating to science fiction.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,020
Okay, very good.

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,920
So why don't we listen to a dialogue for the first time and we'll come back and look at

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,280
all these phrases.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Captain, we are under attack by an unidentified ship.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Damage report.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,160
We've sustained heavy damages to the engines.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
We've lost our warp drive.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,560
We'll have to attempt to make contact.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,760
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
We don't wish to engage.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,200
What is the nature of this attack?

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,840
I am Captain Kor of the ship Kortos, your ship attack that will search party.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,920
No, you're not doing it right.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,680
Kor doesn't sound like that.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,480
His voice is deeper.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,920
I am Captain Kor of the ship Kortos, your ship.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,240
No, if you can't do an authentic Klingon voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,800
fan who can actually act, okay?

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,160
But, but, I already bought the Klingon suit and the wig and...

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,240
All right, very good Star Trek fans.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,120
Apparently, they were trying to act out one of the famous episodes where the Klingons

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,800
attack the Enterprise.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,280
My goodness.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,920
I don't know a lot about Star Trek, but I do know a lot about language and we've got

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,080
some great stuff here that will help you understand sci-fi movies and TV shows in English a little

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
bit better.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,680
So, why don't we go now to Fluency Builder?

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Fluency Builder.

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,880
All right, so the first phrase that we have today on Fluency Builder, unidentified ship.

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,560
An unidentified ship.

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
Unidentified ship.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Unidentified ship.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,200
If we break it down and look at the first word, unidentified.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,440
You don't know which one it is.

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,160
Okay, you don't know the identity.

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Yep.

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,760
And a ship, I guess that's short for...

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
A rocket ship.

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
A rocket ship.

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Or a spaceship.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Okay.

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
So, we're not talking boats here.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
All right.

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
We're not talking about boats.

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Very good.

55
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,360
So, the next phrase, the Enterprise lost its warp drive.

56
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Warp drive.

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Warp drive.

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Warp drive.

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,400
So, the warp drive of the Enterprise is actually something like an engine that allows it to

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,440
go faster than the speed of light.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
So, super fast.

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Super fast.

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
But why warp?

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
All right.

65
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,560
Well, if we take a look at the word warp, that actually means to bend.

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Yep.

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,840
So, like when you warp wood, it bends.

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Exactly.

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,800
You bend wood or you warp metal.

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,920
And well, that's kind of the theory behind it is that they're going so fast that they

71
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,000
bend or warp time.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, warp drive.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,880
I think a very sci-fi specific phrase here.

75
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Right.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
All right.

77
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,200
And for our third phrase today, search party.

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Search party.

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,880
A search party.

80
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
A search party.

81
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Okay.

82
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
So, what is this?

83
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Are we having a party?

84
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
What's going on?

85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,920
Well, when somebody gets lost, you know, maybe in the woods or something, you send out a

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
search party to find them.

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,240
So, a party would be a group of people.

88
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Exactly.

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,880
So, that also happens in restaurants, I think, right?

90
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Right.

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Sometimes you might say how many people in your party.

92
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
In your party.

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Very good.

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
So, party, group of people.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
All right.

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,120
So, in the dialogue, we saw that actually these were not real Star Trek characters,

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
but they were just acting.

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
But it didn't sound quite right, right?

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
He said that his voice is deeper.

101
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,440
So, a deep voice.

102
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Deep voice.

103
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
A deep voice.

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
All right.

105
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,520
We're going to hear an example of what a deep voice sounds like.

106
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:10,360
The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball.

107
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,840
America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers.

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,480
It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again.

109
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
That is a deep voice.

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,400
Now, because his voice wasn't deep enough, he didn't sound authentic.

111
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Authentic.

112
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Authentic.

113
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
All right.

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,240
So, authentic, very easy word.

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Real.

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
True to life.

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Real.

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
True to life, right?

119
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Not fake.

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Exactly.

121
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
So, Marco, is that an authentic Rolex?

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
No, it's not.

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,480
But thank you for noticing.

124
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,880
All right.

125
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
So, authentic.

126
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,440
And our last word for today.

127
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
A wig.

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
A wig.

129
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
A wig.

130
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
W-I-G.

131
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Wig.

132
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,320
So, a wig is pretend hair, right?

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Right.

134
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Fake hair.

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
So, the hair is not authentic.

136
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Very good.

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
All right.

138
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
So, a wig.

139
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
All right.

140
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
We've got some great language here.

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:15,880
Why don't we listen to it one more time, slowed down a little bit, in the dialogue.

142
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:25,600
Captain, we're under attack by an unidentified ship.

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Damage report.

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
We've sustained heavy damages to the engines.

145
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
We've lost our warp drive.

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,640
We'll have to attempt to make contact.

147
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,900
This is Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise.

148
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,800
We don't wish to engage.

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,960
What is the nature of this attack?

150
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,920
I am Captain Kor of the ship Clothos.

151
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Your ship attacked our search party.

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,200
No, you're not doing it right.

153
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Kor doesn't sound like that.

154
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,520
His voice is deeper.

155
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,800
I am Captain Kor of the ship Clothos.

156
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Your ship.

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
No.

158
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,000
If you can't do an authentic Klingon voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,440
fan who can actually act, okay?

160
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,520
But but, I already bought the Klingon suit and the wig.

161
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
All right.

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,440
Now it's time for us to take a look at more phrases today in Fluency Builder.

163
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Fluency Builder.

164
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
All right.

165
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,320
So, we've got some phrases here that you can use together with a number of different words,

166
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
right?

167
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Absolutely.

168
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,840
So, the first one, we heard that data said we're under attack.

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,480
We're under attack.

170
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Under attack.

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
All right.

172
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,960
So, if we're under attack, it means that we are being attacked.

173
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Someone is shooting guns at you or trying to hurt you or something like that.

174
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Okay.

175
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
So, we are under attack.

176
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,600
Very popular phrase that you would hear in war movies or something.

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Definitely.

178
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,880
Now, you can change this by changing the last word.

179
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
We are under fire.

180
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,640
Under fire, which basically means the same thing.

181
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,440
Yeah, except it, when you're under fire, there are guns involved.

182
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Okay.

183
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
So, they're shooting at you.

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Yep.

185
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
All right.

186
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
We're under attack.

187
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
We're under fire.

188
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Mm-hmm.

189
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
All right.

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
Moving on to our second phrase.

191
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,760
We've sustained heavy damage.

192
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Sustained heavy damage.

193
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,120
So, when you sustain something, you receive it or you undergo this thing.

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,120
So, usually, it's related to injury or to receiving some type of...

195
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Of negative thing.

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay.

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,680
So, why don't we listen to some examples of how we could use sustain in context.

198
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Example one.

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,880
John had a car accident and sustained a fatal injury.

200
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,840
Example two.

201
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,600
The boxer sustained a severe neck injury in the championship fight.

202
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Example three.

203
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,520
Luckily, the warship didn't sustain any serious damage.

204
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
All right.

205
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:12,920
So, you see, we typically sustain something like an injury or damage that is negative.

206
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Very good.

207
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Mm-hmm.

208
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,920
And our last phrase for today, what is the nature of this attack?

209
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,840
What is the nature of?

210
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
What is the nature of?

211
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Okay.

212
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,560
So, basically, he's just asking, why are you doing this?

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Right.

214
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Why...

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
What is the reason?

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Yeah.

217
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
What is the purpose?

218
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Mm-hmm.

219
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,160
So, again, we have some more examples of how you could use what is the nature of in different

220
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,520
situations.

221
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Example one.

222
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,520
What is the nature of your visits to the United States?

223
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,640
Example two.

224
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,640
What is the nature of the threat against our country?

225
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Example three.

226
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,280
The nature of my visit is personal.

227
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Okay.

228
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,120
So, a great phrase you can use not only when you're talking sci-fi, but in everyday life.

229
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Exactly.

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,240
So, why don't we listen now to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back

231
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,280
and talk a little bit more.

232
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:32,040
Captain, we are under attack by an unidentified ship.

233
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Damage report.

234
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,880
We've sustained heavy damages to the engines.

235
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
We've lost our warp drive.

236
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,280
We'll have to attempt to make contact.

237
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,480
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise.

238
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,140
We don't wish to engage.

239
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,920
What is the nature of this attack?

240
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,200
I am Captain Kor of the ship Kortos.

241
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Your ship attacked our search party.

242
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,640
No, you're not doing it right.

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,400
Kor doesn't sound like that.

244
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
His voice is deeper.

245
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,080
I am Captain Kor of the ship Kortos.

246
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Your ship...

247
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
No!

248
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,800
I don't want to do an authentic Klingon voice.

249
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,600
I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan who can actually act, okay?

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,760
But, but, I already bought the Klingon suit and the wig and...

251
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:24,200
Well, Marco, I already admitted that I'm not much of a sci-fi fan, and I don't really know

252
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
anything about Star Trek or Star Wars.

253
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,800
Well, it is a very popular show.

254
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,720
I think it started around the 60s or 70s.

255
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,160
The first version of Star Trek, and well, many, many people follow it now.

256
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,400
They dress up, they know the secret language that is used on the show, they know the spaceships.

257
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a big culture.

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
That's true, and speaking of culture, I think we've got a Star Trek movie coming out pretty

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,760
soon, so some of this language can help you guys understand it a little bit better.

260
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Very good, yeah.

261
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,200
So, if you have any other questions or comments related to, not only to science fiction, but
