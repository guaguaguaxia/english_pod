00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,380
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,520
And today we have a delicious lesson all about Chinese food for you.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
That's right.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,880
Today we are ordering Chinese food.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,340
Now for many of you listeners that are actually Chinese, you may not recognize these dishes

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,500
because we are talking about American Chinese food.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
That's right.

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,100
So long, long ago, people came over to America from mainly Hong Kong.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,000
And so a lot of the food we have is kind of more like Hong Kong food.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cantonese food.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Cantonese food.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,700
But it's also very American.

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,820
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out exactly what we're eating.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,000
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,140
Can I get you anything to drink?

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,140
Coke for me, please.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,140
I'll have a Sprite.

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,460
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,420
Are there any questions with the menu?

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,420
Do you use MSG?

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,420
No ma'am, we are MSG free.

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,860
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long.

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,980
I want everything.

26
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,300
This place has the best sesame chicken.

27
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,260
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,300
I used to get takeout all the time.

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,020
It's definitely been a while.

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,500
Let's start off with some crab Rangoon.

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,220
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,140
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll and egg drop

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,140
soup.

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,820
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,300
It all looks so appetizing.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,540
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons and white rice.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,820
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

38
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
You should at least get brown rice.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,820
I don't think so.

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,180
I hate brown rice and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,540
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,620
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie laden Chinese food.

43
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,420
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,380
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,340
Let's call the waitress over.

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,420
Alright, we're back.

47
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,820
So obviously everything seems so good.

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,460
Very typical American Chinese dishes and we have a lot of things that we can take a look

49
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,900
at so let's start with language takeaway.

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,260
Language takeaway.

51
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,540
In language takeaway today, we're going to be talking about some general food words,

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,500
words that you can use when you're ordering food.

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,380
So the first one we should talk about is this MSG.

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,940
Right, Andrea asks, do you use MSG?

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,340
So why is she asking this and what is MSG?

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,580
MSG is an ingredient in foods.

57
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,700
It's kind of like a condiment, something that you put on the food after the food has been

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,780
cooked and it makes the food taste better, brighter.

59
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
It intensifies the flavors a little bit.

60
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,700
Yeah, and it's kind of, it looks like salt or sugar.

61
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,700
It's on the tables usually at Chinese restaurants but a lot of people don't like MSG because

62
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,300
they don't think it's very safe for their bodies.

63
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,140
And so actually the waitress says that the food is MSG free, which means there's no MSG

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,140
in it.

65
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
That's right.

66
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,220
Okay, so she says our food is MSG free, which is this chemical.

67
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,820
I think it's kind of like a chemical that you described.

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,700
That's right and a lot of people don't want it.

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,380
So you can ask, is this food MSG free?

70
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,980
You could also ask, is it fat free?

71
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,860
Is it salt free?

72
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,180
So this is a very helpful way of asking about what the ingredients are in a dish.

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
That's right, that's right.

74
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,300
And actually Manny is talking about the food as well and he says, yeah, I've been craving

75
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Chinese for such a long time.

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,860
Okay, so the verb here is to crave but he said he's been craving.

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,380
So he really has been wanting this food for a long time.

78
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,220
So if you say I'm craving Italian food, what does that mean?

79
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,100
That means I really want to eat Italian food.

80
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,900
You feel like having Italian food.

81
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
That's right.

82
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,420
So I'm craving some kind of food.

83
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,180
I really want to eat it.

84
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
Okay.

85
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,580
And he said that he used to get takeout all the time.

86
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,780
So he's obviously talking about Chinese food.

87
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,180
What does he mean by takeout?

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,660
Well, takeout is the opposite of sitting down in a restaurant and eating food.

89
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,700
Takeout is what you do when you want to go home and eat it.

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,580
So in many restaurants, you can order the food and you go and you pick up the food and

91
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,580
you bring it home.

92
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,860
Okay, so that's takeout.

93
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,980
So it's a noun.

94
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,380
You get takeout.

95
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,340
Right, but it's a little bit different from a different kind of takeout.

96
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,700
There's takeout where you order the food and you pick it up and you bring it home.

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,660
But there's also delivery and delivery is when you order the food and someone else brings

98
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
it to you.

99
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,260
So be careful with those two.

100
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,580
All right, very good.

101
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,060
Moving forward, Manny kept talking about the food and said, wow, everything on the menu

102
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,020
looks so appetizing.

103
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,940
It all looks so appetizing.

104
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,100
Okay, appetizing is a way to describe something.

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
In this case, we're describing food.

106
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,620
So that's normally how we use the word appetizing.

107
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,580
So appetizing basically means that you're excited about eating this food because it

108
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,340
looks like it will be good.

109
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,460
So what about the word appetizer?

110
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,220
Does this have anything to do with it?

111
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,900
I think appetizer is something that makes you want to eat more.

112
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,700
That's why it's at the beginning of a meal.

113
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,780
You have your appetizer before you have your main course.

114
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,620
But the word appetizing means that it's very appealing.

115
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,780
You really want to eat it.

116
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
It looks good.

117
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
It looks delicious.

118
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,340
Okay, very good.

119
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,620
And Andrea was worried because Manny is ordering so much food.

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,420
She asks, aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

121
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,300
Okay, so this is a phrase and I want to remind everyone to keep this phrase in mind.

122
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,980
You can diet, which is a verb, but in this case, you're on a diet.

123
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,180
So it's a noun.

124
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm on a diet.

125
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,260
I'm trying to eat healthily.

126
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,620
I'm trying to watch the things that I put in my body.

127
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,140
So usually if you're on a diet, you don't eat really greasy, fatty, take out Chinese

128
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
food.

129
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,060
You eat salads and soups.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,820
Okay, so you are on a diet.

131
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,740
Yes, he's on a diet or I was on a diet, but I stopped.

132
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,340
Alright, a lot of great appealing food.

133
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,860
Why don't we go and listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back with Language Takeaway

134
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:22,740
Part 2 where we're going to take a look at the specific American Chinese dishes.

135
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,400
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,420
Can I get you anything to drink?

137
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
Coke for me, please.

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
I'll have a Sprite.

139
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,100
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

140
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,020
Are there any questions with the menu?

141
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,820
Do you use MSG?

142
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,300
No ma'am, we are MSG free.

143
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long.

144
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,420
I want everything.

145
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,740
This place has the best sesame chicken.

146
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,700
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

147
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,740
I used to get takeout all the time.

148
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,460
It's definitely been a while.

149
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,980
Let's start off with some crab Rangoon.

150
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,660
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

151
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,580
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop

152
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
soup.

153
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,260
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

154
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,740
It all looks so appetizing.

155
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,980
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

156
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,260
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

157
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
You should at least get brown rice.

158
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
I don't think so.

159
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,340
I hate brown rice.

160
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,620
And I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

161
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,980
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

162
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,060
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

163
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,980
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

164
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,860
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

165
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,580
Let's call the waitress over.

166
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,740
All right, we're back.

167
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,460
So now let's take a look at those delicious American Chinese dishes on Language Takeaway

168
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,620
Part 2.

169
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,020
Language Takeaway.

170
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,500
And so here we are with a number of delicious and very appetizing dishes.

171
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,660
These are things that you'll normally find in an American Chinese restaurant.

172
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,380
The first one is called crab rangoon.

173
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,100
Okay, so this doesn't sound very Chinese at all.

174
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,300
Now rangoon is actually a city in a country called Myanmar or Burma.

175
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:24,380
And crab rangoon is a special deep-fried dish that's like, it's like deep-fried dumplings,

176
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,700
but on the inside there's cream cheese and crab.

177
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Crab meat.

178
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
That's right.

179
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,500
So it's kind of, as you said, like a dumpling, but inside you have cream cheese and crab.

180
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Right.

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
All right, very good.

182
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,660
Now, they also talked about getting the sesame chicken with fried rice.

183
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,580
Okay, so sesame is a very common ingredient in cultures all over the world.

184
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,700
And sesame is a kind of seed.

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,900
But some people also use some sesame oil in their cooking.

186
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,780
And so these all come from these white, small seeds.

187
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,780
And sesame chicken is a kind of chicken that's cooked with sesame seeds.

188
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,300
Okay, very good.

189
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,420
And obviously we know what fried rice is.

190
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,980
You just take, it's just basically rice in a pan with sometimes a little bit of meat

191
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,020
and egg and just fry it all together.

192
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,100
But what about spring rolls?

193
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,980
I think these are one of the typical Chinese dishes that everyone knows.

194
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,940
And actually it's a Chinese dish as well.

195
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,580
I love spring rolls, although I've never gotten an American spring roll in China.

196
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,860
The spring rolls we're talking about here are basically wrappers, these like wonton

197
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,780
wrappers that are stuffed with meat and vegetables.

198
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,980
And they're rolled up so they look like a long roll and they're deep fried.

199
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,060
So okay, so spring rolls are, as you said, little rolls with meat and sometimes vegetable

200
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,540
inside.

201
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,020
Not really sure why they call it spring roll though.

202
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,180
I don't know either.

203
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,140
Maybe it has to do with the ingredients, like they're vegetables from the spring.

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
Maybe.

205
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,220
Now, another one that I actually really, really like is this egg drop soup.

206
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
This is delicious.

207
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,980
This is a very simple soup and when you're cooking it, you break an egg and the egg is

208
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,100
mixed into the soup.

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,020
So it looks like it's kind of got these yellow pieces floating, but it's a really nice simple

210
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
soup with egg.

211
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,460
Okay, and that's what it's called, egg drop soup.

212
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,180
Now you mentioned the wonton wrappers and they also mentioned fried wontons.

213
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,620
What are wontons?

214
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:29,260
Okay, wontons are also known as hundun in mainland China, but this is a special kind

215
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,340
of dumpling.

216
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,980
It's got a piece of dough basically that's flattened out and inside there's meat, maybe

217
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,620
some vegetables.

218
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,340
And sometimes you eat it in soup, but here we're talking about fried wontons, deep fried

219
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,420
wontons.

220
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,260
So you put them in the deep fryer and they're fried so that they're crunchy and the insides

221
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
are soft.

222
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,440
Actually, this is one of my favorite dishes.

223
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,500
The original one in China though, as you said, the hundun, because it's like in a soup.

224
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,540
And it's very simple, but you have like dumplings in a soup, but the fried ones are also very,

225
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
very good.

226
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,700
They are both delicious and this is making me very hungry.

227
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,780
So maybe we should listen to our dialogue again.

228
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,700
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

229
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,860
Can I get you anything to drink?

230
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Coke for me, please.

231
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
I'll have a Sprite.

232
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

233
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,060
Are there any questions with the menu?

234
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,100
Do you use MSG?

235
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,500
No ma'am, we are MSG free.

236
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,580
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long.

237
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,700
I want everything.

238
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,060
This place has the best sesame chicken.

239
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,980
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

240
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,020
I used to get takeout all the time.

241
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,740
It's definitely been a while.

242
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,220
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

243
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,980
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

244
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,860
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll and egg drop

245
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
soup.

246
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,540
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

247
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,020
It all looks so appetizing.

248
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,260
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons and white rice.

249
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,540
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

250
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
You should at least get brown rice.

251
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
I don't think so.

252
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,900
I hate brown rice and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

253
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,260
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

254
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,300
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie laden Chinese food.

255
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,260
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

256
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

257
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,820
Let's call the waitress over.

258
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Alright, we're back.

259
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,860
As we mentioned, these dishes have a certain American influence to them.

260
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
They're not really spicy.

261
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,580
I think that's the main difference as well.

262
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,460
American Chinese food doesn't really have the intense garlic flavor nor is it spicy

263
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,900
like usual Chinese food.

264
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
That's right.

265
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,460
I think that part of that is, like I said, due to the fact that a lot of the Chinese

266
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,980
Americans who first came over came from Hong Kong.

267
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,500
And so Hong Kong food is not as famous for its spiciness.

268
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,260
It's not like Sichuan food.

269
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,780
You will see a lot of sweet sauces like this general sauce chicken is a very, very sweet

270
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
sauce.

271
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,020
You'll also see a lot of soy sauce in American Chinese cooking.

272
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,140
And so these are flavors that are very, very strong and they're not the same as the Chinese

273
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,180
peppers and these spicy foods you get in China.

274
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
That's right.

275
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,180
And actually there's one more dish that we didn't mention in the dialogue actually, but

276
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,820
is very famous all around the United States.

277
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,660
It's called chop suey.

278
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Chop suey.

279
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,900
And many people have argued about where the name comes from.

280
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,940
But chop suey is just basically like everything chopped up and fried together, right?

281
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,420
It's like stir fried vegetables and meat.

282
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,940
And all put together in just a bowl.

283
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Yeah.

284
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,100
Well, my favorite thing about the American Chinese food that we get is that we get it

285
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
in these little boxes.

286
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
They're very cute.

287
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,260
And you take them home and you open them up and every food has a box.

288
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,600
And then at the end, you also get a fortune cookie, which is a very small cookie.

289
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,480
And inside there's a piece of paper.

290
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
So don't eat the paper.

291
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,500
And the paper has a fortune for you.

292
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,740
It says, you will be very lucky today.

293
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,060
Or your favorite number is 17.

294
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
And they're very cute.

295
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,860
Actually, you can see these boxes that Catherine mentions on our lesson page.

296
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,360
It's the lesson photo.

297
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,260
And as you said, very, very common.

298
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,980
Each dish is put in this little box.

299
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,020
So if you ever get Chinese food, you'll see people carrying these little boxes around

300
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,940
because they're very convenient and easy to carry.

301
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,300
But the fortune cookie thing is also very common.

302
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,700
I was actually very surprised when I went to China and there were no fortune cookies.

303
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
It's weird, isn't it?

304
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,180
I think it's funny because we expect these things to be very Chinese.

305
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,660
But in fact, when you come to mainland China, they don't have fortune cookies.

306
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,900
So I think it's a nice surprise but also kind of confusing.

307
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
That's right.

308
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,220
Well, a very interesting topic.

309
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,860
And in the future, we're going to continue doing different lessons about different cuisines.

310
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,400
We have Italian food coming up sometime soon.

311
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,260
So that's going to be very good as well.

312
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,100
And of course, if you have any lesson suggestions or maybe you want to suggest the cuisine from

313
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,740
your country, you can visit our website englishpod.com and leave your comments there.

314
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,900
We hope to see you guys there and until next time.

315
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Bye.

316
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:37,140
Thanks for watching.
