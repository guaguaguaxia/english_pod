00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,240
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,960
And today we're going to be talking about one of our favorite topics as always.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
Food.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
Food.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
We're going to be at a restaurant.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,760
And, you know, one of the most difficult or embarrassing things to deal with at a restaurant

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,440
is what to say when you don't like the food or when it's bad quality food.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Right.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,960
So maybe we have to complain about the food or maybe even the service, right?

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
That's right.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,000
And in this lesson, we're going to be learning some really wonderful words and phrases that

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,360
you can use when you need to complain about the food or the service in a restaurant.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Okay.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,960
So before we listen to what happens in this restaurant with this food, let's take a look

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,880
very quickly at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Okay.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,280
We're only going to do one word today.

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,640
And this you'll hear in the dialogue.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
An establishment.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Establishment.

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,200
This kind of establishment.

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Okay.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,560
So when I say an establishment, that's a noun.

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
What is an establishment?

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,360
It's basically a fancy word for a business or a restaurant in this case.

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
In this case, it's a restaurant.

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Yeah.

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,140
But in general, you can say it's a business.

32
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,360
So you have a very fine establishment.

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
That's right.

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,040
So an establishment, a type of business, a place of business, really.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Very good.

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
All right.

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,840
So now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue.

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,040
We're going to find out what's going on here.

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Apparently, there is a very angry customer and we're going to find out why.

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Excuse me, waiter.

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Yes, sir.

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,840
What can I do for you?

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,240
I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water,

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,400
brought any bread to the table, and our appetizers haven't been served yet.

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,480
You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm sorry, sir.

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
I'll check on your order right away.

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Relax, honey.

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,880
The place is busy tonight and I've heard the food is amazing.

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
Anyway.

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Here you are, sir.

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
The foie gras for the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Waiter!

54
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,120
I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,000
The soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's completely inedible.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,280
I do apologize for that.

59
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,760
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,280
Take this foie gras back as well.

61
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
And look at the portion size.

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,960
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver?

64
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Right away, sir.

65
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Honey, come on.

66
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
The foie gras was fine.

67
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,440
Why are you making such a big deal?

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
What do you mean?

70
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,280
We're paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard earned bucks.

71
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,680
I expect value for money.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,840
Here you are, sir.

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,240
I hope it is all right now.

74
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,120
The chef has prepared it especially for you.

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Yes, fine.

76
00:02:50,120 --> 00:03:16,280
Honey, are you all right?

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,080
Well I guess that's one lesson.

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,320
Hey, if you're in a restaurant, don't be too rude to the waiter.

79
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
You never know what's going to happen.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,280
The waiter and the cook, right?

81
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,840
Yeah, you don't want to offend that kitchen staff.

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
All right.

83
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,280
So we'll talk about that a little bit later on but now I think we had some really interesting

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,120
vocabulary of how to describe food that is not well prepared and we can take a look at

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,080
that now in Language Takeaway.

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,400
Language Takeaway.

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,120
All right, so the guy in this dialogue, he ordered a mushroom soup and he complained

88
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,240
that the mushroom soup was too runny.

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay, the soup is too runny.

90
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Runny.

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
So he wanted a cream of mushroom so it should be a little bit thicker.

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Yep.

93
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,200
But in this case, it was runny.

94
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,480
So when something is runny, it's too liquid.

95
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Too liquid.

96
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,480
And I think we can relate it to a runny nose, right?

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Exactly.

98
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,360
Okay, so when liquid is coming out of your nose, a runny nose, in this case, the soup

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
is runny.

100
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Right.

101
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,760
And another thing that he was complaining about, the food was over seasoned.

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Over seasoned.

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
The food is over seasoned.

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,720
Okay, so if the food is over seasoned.

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,840
It's too salty.

106
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,640
So it's another way of saying it's too salty.

107
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah, it's kind of a fancy cooking term.

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,520
Now can I say if there's too much pepper in the food, can I say it's over seasoned?

109
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,860
Well, technically no.

110
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,760
When a cook says something is over seasoned, he's talking salt only.

111
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Only salt.

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,160
So the cream of mushroom is very runny, it's over seasoned, and he said it's completely

113
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
inedible.

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Inedible.

115
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
It's inedible.

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Inedible.

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Now, this word edible.

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
You can eat it.

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
You can eat it.

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,020
So we have this prefix inedible.

121
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,080
You cannot eat it.

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
This is not possible.

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Yep.

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,040
And it doesn't mean that physically you can't eat it.

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,840
It just means it's pretty disgusting.

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Okay.

127
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,880
This food is inedible.

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,240
And then he started to complain about the other dish and he said that it's rubbery.

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
Rubbery.

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
The foie gras was rubbery.

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,840
All right.

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,520
So I think we noticed the word rubber.

133
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,860
So obviously if a food is rubbery, it's too chewy.

134
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,160
It's like chewing on the bottom of your shoe, right?

135
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,680
Okay, so it's too hard to chew or to swallow.

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Exactly.

137
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
All right.

138
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,320
And apparently the food was rubbery because it's completely overcooked.

139
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Overcooked.

140
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
All right.

141
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
We have overcooked.

142
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,700
So when something is overcooked, I mean it's easy to understand that it's cooked too much.

143
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,720
But it doesn't mean that it's burnt, right?

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
No.

145
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,080
So maybe you've ordered your steak to be rare, but it comes to you well done.

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,760
So it's not burnt, but it's cooked too much.

147
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,200
So also I guess we can say like chicken.

148
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,880
Sometimes if you overcook chicken, it comes out too dry.

149
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Yep.

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Right.

151
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,680
So to overcook something.

152
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,120
And finally he was complaining about the size of the dish and he said, this is a sliver

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
of duck liver.

154
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Okay.

155
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
A sliver.

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
A sliver.

157
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
All right.

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,040
Now this word sliver is like a slice, right?

159
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,120
A very small, tiny little slice.

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Okay.

161
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,520
So we can say, okay, I just want a sliver of bacon for breakfast.

162
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
All right.

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,440
Let's look at a few more examples of how we can use sliver.

164
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,200
Example one.

165
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,360
No, John's on a diet.

166
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,280
He'll just have a sliver of cake and no ice cream.

167
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
Example two.

168
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm really full, but it looks so delicious.

169
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,920
Can you just cut me a sliver?

170
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,140
Example three.

171
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,240
You call this sliver of beef on my plate a meal?

172
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,320
There's almost nothing here.

173
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,960
And those are all the words we had for language takeaway.

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,480
Now you have, so we've given you different adjectives of describing food that is not

175
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
well prepared.

176
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,720
So now let's move on to some other phrases that the customer used to complain in Fluency

177
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,040
Builder.

178
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Fluency Builder.

179
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Okay.

180
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,600
So before we get to the customer complaining language, I want to look at a phrase that

181
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,320
the waiter used to apologize.

182
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,680
He said, I do apologize.

183
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,040
I do apologize.

184
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I do apologize.

185
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,240
Now, why is this phrase so interesting?

186
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,800
Well, I mean, it's pretty easy to understand the meaning, but I want to look at why he

187
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,200
added this verb do.

188
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:52,040
Well, he added the verb do to this phrase to make it seem a little bit stronger, to

189
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,760
give a little more power to his apology.

190
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Right.

191
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,800
So if you have an affirmative phrase, like I apologize, it's good.

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,480
If you want to give it a little bit more emphasis, you can say, I do apologize.

193
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,160
Why don't we give an example?

194
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,800
So I might say this, Marco, I didn't know we had a party tonight.

195
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,440
And I might say, what?

196
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,600
I did tell you about it last week.

197
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Right.

198
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,080
So you're just giving a little bit more power to the statement that you told me.

199
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,280
So this do, did, does, becomes an auxiliary to make it more powerful, to give it more

200
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
emphasis.

201
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Yeah, exactly.

202
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,120
And a neat little phrase, something you can use if you want to make your apologies sound

203
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,560
maybe a little bit stronger.

204
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,920
All right.

205
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,880
Now moving on to the next phrase, he was complaining about the food and it was terrible.

206
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,640
And he said, I'm shelling out my hard earned bucks.

207
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,120
Okay, let's break this one down into two sections.

208
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
We'll start with shelling out.

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
All right.

210
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,060
So to shell out.

211
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,440
So when you shell out, you pay for something.

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
All right.

213
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,960
So this gives you the sensation that you are, that you don't really want to pay.

214
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,520
You're a bit unhappy about it.

215
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Right.

216
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
So you want to shell out your money.

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Why don't we listen to some examples to show us how we can use this phrase to shell out.

218
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Example one.

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Great.

220
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,280
It's my girlfriend's birthday this month.

221
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,960
So I'm going to have to shell out for a present.

222
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,080
Example two.

223
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,160
I really want those shoes, but I can't really afford to shell out $400.

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,400
Example three.

225
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,040
I can't believe it.

226
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,720
Ella shelled out the 800 bucks for the tickets.

227
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,560
I thought I would have to pay.

228
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
All right.

229
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,360
So now that we understand shell out, let's move on to the second part of that sentence.

230
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,680
My hard earned bucks.

231
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,960
Hard earned bucks.

232
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
My hard earned bucks.

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay.

234
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
So bucks are dollars, right?

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
Dollars, only dollars, right?

236
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah.

237
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,320
Not pounds, not euros.

238
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,680
But his hard earned bucks is money he had to work really hard for.

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
So I can also say my hard earned money, right?

240
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,320
Or my hard earned cash.

241
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Exactly.

242
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Very good.

243
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,880
So you worked hard to get it.

244
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
All right.

245
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,960
So three great phrases that can be used when you're complaining in a restaurant.

246
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,200
Why don't we hear them one last time in context by listening to the dialogue.

247
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Excuse me, waiter.

248
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Yes, sir.

249
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,480
What can I do for you?

250
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,400
I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water,

251
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,560
brought any bread to the table, and our appetizers haven't been served yet.

252
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,640
You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.

253
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm sorry, sir.

254
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,440
I'll check on your order right away.

255
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Relax, honey.

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,080
The place is busy tonight and I've heard the food is amazing.

257
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Anyway.

258
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Here you are, sir.

259
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,400
The foie gras for the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

260
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Waiter!

261
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,280
I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

262
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,160
The soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

263
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,400
It's completely inedible.

264
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,360
Okay, I do apologize for that.

265
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,920
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

266
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
Take this foie gras back as well.

267
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,640
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

268
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
And look at the portion size.

269
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,120
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver?

270
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Right away, sir.

271
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Honey, come on.

272
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
The foie gras was fine.

273
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Why are you making such a big deal?

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,960
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

275
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,400
What do you mean?

276
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,440
We're paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard earned bucks.

277
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,840
I expect value for money.

278
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,000
Here you are, sir.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
I hope it is all right now.

280
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,240
The chef has prepared it especially for you.

281
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Yes, fine.

282
00:11:36,240 --> 00:12:03,000
Honey, are you all right?

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,880
So complaining at a restaurant and actually sending food back is not uncommon in the US.

284
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Yeah, of course.

285
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,560
If the food's bad, of course you're going to send it back.

286
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,040
But maybe in other cultures, I think people would be a little bit more reluctant to do

287
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
something like this.

288
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Yeah.

289
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,400
But hey, you know what's an interesting thing about the way Americans eat in restaurants

290
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,520
is sometimes at the end of the meal, if they haven't finished everything, they might ask

291
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,960
for a doggy bag.

292
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
A doggy bag, yeah.

293
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
So what is that, a doggy bag?

294
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,240
Well, usually if you order a big meal or half your steak is left over on your plate, you

295
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,680
would ask for a doggy bag and they would bring you a little box or a bag and you would take

296
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,400
it to supposedly give it to your dog.

297
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Right.

298
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,040
So it's sort of like you tell the waiter, oh, the steak was so good, I couldn't finish

299
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
it, can I take some home to my dog?

300
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Right.

301
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,720
So you would just ask, waiter, can I have a doggy bag?

302
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Right.

303
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,600
But it's sort of like code for I'm going to eat this tomorrow for lunch.

304
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Exactly.

305
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,120
So people wouldn't really give it to their dog.

306
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,840
You know, that steak wrapped up in a fancy sort of foil salon is going to be a pretty

307
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,560
delicious the next day.

308
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Right.

309
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Yeah.

310
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
It's actually very common in the US, but in other countries, people will leave entire

311
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
plates of food on the table.

312
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,280
It would be totally impolite to ask the waiter to pack up the food for you.

313
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Exactly.

314
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,080
So a little bit of cultural differences, but we want to know what you think and how things

315
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,840
are done maybe in your country with complaining or sending food back or even this whole doggy

316
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
bag situation.

317
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
That's right.

318
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,240
Why don't you visit our website, EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

319
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
All right.

320
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,840
We'll be there to answer any questions or comments, but we got to go now.

321
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
So until then.

322
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Goodbye.

323
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:55,740
From Jeff and Charlie's view of what it's like to not have a dog.
