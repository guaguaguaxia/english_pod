00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,680
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,480
Hey Amira, how are you today?

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm doing great.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
What about you?

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,600
I'm doing pretty good.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,440
I'm excited about this lesson that you have for us today.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,800
Yes, it's actually a very, very useful lesson.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,000
It's about someone asking his boss for an assistant.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Oh, okay, an assistant.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
What's an assistant?

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,080
Well, it's someone who helps you with your work around the office.

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,440
Okay, great.

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,440
So let's listen to this dialogue and when we come back, we'll take a look at all the

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:48,520
interesting and useful vocabulary that you'll find.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,000
Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,400
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,280
The timing is just not right.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,280
The economy is bad and it's too risky to take on new staff.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,640
Yeah, I guess you're right.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Here's an idea.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,480
What if we hire an intern?

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,600
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
She?

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,740
Yeah, you know, a recent graduate.

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,720
She could give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,360
That sounds reasonable.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,280
Let me see what I can do.

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,560
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,120
Okay, great.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Let's meet her.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Hi, I'm Adam.

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Oh, hi, I'm Tony.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
And we're back.

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Tony, he's surprised, huh?

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Yeah, he's, I don't know why though he's surprised.

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
I think we should talk about that a little bit later.

39
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Yes, for now, let's look at some interesting vocabulary.

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
So, let's start with the first one.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
What's an assistant?

42
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, it's someone who helps you with your work around the office.

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
The timing is just not right.

45
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
The economy is bad and it's too risky to take on new staff.

46
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
He could give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down.

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
That sounds reasonable.

48
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,320
But, I don't know why though he's surprised, I think we should talk about that a little

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
bit later.

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Yes, for now, let's look at some interesting vocabulary and phrases here.

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
Marco, I know you've chosen one for us.

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Yeah, the first one that I want to take a look at is resources.

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Resources.

54
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Resources.

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Resources.

56
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
And that means in this text, basically money.

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Right.

58
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
So, the office doesn't have enough money.

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Okay, I've chosen another interesting word for you and that's money.

60
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Money.

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Money.

62
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Okay, so, money.

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Money.

64
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Okay, so, money.

65
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Money.

66
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Okay, so, money.

67
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Money.

68
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Okay, so, money.

69
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Okay, so, money.

70
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Okay, so, money.

71
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Okay, so, money.

72
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Okay, so, money.

73
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay, so, money.

74
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Okay, so, money.

75
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Now, you understand now that they're working quiteLaughs.

76
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
So, I changed my felt to the word ominous and I swapped one with my last name.

77
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Okay.

78
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
The next one here is happened a few years ago.

79
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
It's around this time that the city chief found someone who was stuck in the cajon and

80
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
my wife started following him and making him listen to what he could tip me on, given

81
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
that the city's safest place for coming in on his lucky day was Pサラロールカー

82
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
cite umbrella container sink, so, that's what the picture shows, the woman who's

83
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
known for climbing mountains faster than the coffee vines.

84
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,760
working there. They don't have enough workers. Right, they don't have enough

85
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,160
employees. Perfect, okay. The next one is timing is just not right. The timing is

86
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,840
just not right. The timing is just not right. The timing is just not right. Okay,

87
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,920
let's listen to how we can use this entire phrase in a different situation

88
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:04,240
so then we can understand what it means. Let's listen. I was gonna sell my house

89
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:13,160
but the timing is just not right. Honey, I think we should have a baby. The timing

90
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:24,200
is just not right. Okay, great. I guess that makes it clear. Yes, actually it's

91
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,320
very obvious that it means that it's just not a good time. Right, perfect. I

92
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,160
have another interesting phrase for you which is weight off my shoulders. Weight

93
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,240
off my shoulders. Weight off my shoulders. Weight off my shoulders. So to take

94
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,160
weight off my shoulders is another way of saying to help me with my work or to

95
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,560
take some of my work away from me. If you have a lot of things to do and I come

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,880
and help you that means that I took some of the weight off your shoulders. Yes.

97
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,320
Let's look at the next phrase that we have here and it's give me a hand. Give

98
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,920
me a hand. Give me a hand. Give me a hand. Okay, now this is not literal. It's not

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,000
that I'm gonna give you somebody's hand, right? Let's listen to some examples and

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:27,040
then we can come back and explain what it means. Can you give me a hand with

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
these boxes?

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:45,160
Neil, I'll need you to give me a hand with the sales reports. Here, let me give

103
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,120
you a hand with your suitcase.

104
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:59,160
All right, give me a hand is another way of saying help or to help out. Exactly, to

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,200
help out. Right. Perfect. Now, the last phrase we're going to look at here in

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,240
this dialogue is keep our costs down. Keep our costs down. Keep our costs down.

107
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:20,040
Keep our costs down. So, to keep our costs down means to try and not spend so

108
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,600
much money. Exactly. Many companies, for example, now control how much printing

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,400
you do. Yes. Right. To keep the cost down of paper. Yes. So, in other words, they do

110
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,280
not want to have unnecessary spending. Perfect. Okay, I think it's time for us to

111
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,280
listen to this dialogue one more time but I want everyone to listen and see

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,880
why Tony is surprised at the end when he meets his intern, when he meets his

113
00:05:50,880 --> 00:06:05,840
assistant. Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an

114
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,280
assistant. I understand that but the fact is we're understaffed. The timing is just

115
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,000
not right. The economy is bad and it's too risky to take on new staff. Yeah, I

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
guess you're right. Here's an idea. What if we hire an intern? She would take some

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,920
of the weight off my shoulders. She? Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,680
give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,160
That sounds reasonable. Let me see what I can do.

120
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,600
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant. Okay, great. Let's meet her.

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:59,440
Hi, I'm Adam. Oh, hi, I'm Tony. Well, you know Marco, I think that Tony was really

122
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,880
surprised because he was kind of hoping to have a female intern. Yeah, I think

123
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,440
that's exactly what he was expecting. Maybe this guy is a little bit sexist. He

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,600
thought that an intern should be a girl but instead he was... Instead he got Adam.

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,320
Exactly and it looks like Adam is really big and really tall because he's got

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,000
that deep voice. Right. An intern, Marco, do you want to elaborate on that? Working

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,080
at a company with a very low salary or sometimes no salary at all but what

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,320
you're gaining is experience and you are learning a lot of things. Everyone who

129
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,240
has been an intern or had an intern knows that sometimes they are not

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,520
treated all that well. Sometimes they just serve coffee or they have to do

131
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,640
paperwork. Or like photocopying things. Exactly. Yeah. But some internships are

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,240
really, really cool and some are really good experiences for learning. Yes,

133
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,720
definitely. Actually, I know a friend of mine, she used to work as an intern in

134
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,360
one of those really big companies and she told me that she has gained so much

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,600
experience doing that. Yeah, I mean even if you don't get paid, the experience

136
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,840
that you get is really good and that just opens doors for maybe getting

137
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,200
another job or sometimes the interns get hired by the company to stay because

138
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,920
they do such a good job. Yeah, I think that's mostly the case. Yeah, that

139
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,560
happened to me once. I started working as an intern and after three months I was

140
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,080
hired by the company so it does happen. So you did a good job. Yeah, of course.

141
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,280
Alright folks, we're out of time today. I hope that you enjoyed our lesson and

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,440
we'll be back tomorrow with another really cool and really interesting

143
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,400
lesson from EnglishPod. Don't forget to come to our website at EnglishPod.com

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,240

and I would love to receive your comments and suggestions that you can
