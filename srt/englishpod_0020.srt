1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Well, hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,400
My name's Erica.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
And I'm Marco.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,880
So, Marco, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,340
I'm doing great and I'm really looking forward to our lesson because we're going to the eye

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,340
doctor today.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,360
Okay, so we've got an elementary lesson about going to the eye doctor.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Yes.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,680
Well, let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,340
Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,400
We have three words today in our vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,060
All three words come from our dialogue.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,280
Our first word is struggle.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Struggle.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Struggle.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Struggle.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,940
So, Marco, when I struggle to do something, what does that mean?

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,940
It means it's difficult.

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,720
It means that you have a hard time so you can't really do it very quickly.

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,640
So you have to try really hard.

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,160
You have to try really hard.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,040
Yeah, to do something that's difficult.

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Yes.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Okay, our next word is blurry.

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Blurry.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Blurry.

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
Blurry.

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Blurry.

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
B-L-U-R-R-Y.

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Blurry.

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,720
Whenever something is blurry, you can't really see it well.

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
It's not clear.

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Right.

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
That's right.

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Everything will be blurry.

36
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,920
Okay, and our final word is prescription.

37
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Prescription.

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Prescription.

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,600
Often, when you go to the doctor and you need some medicine, he writes out a prescription.

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Right.

41
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,640
It's like a paper that says all the medicine that you need and then you can go to the drug

42
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,160
store and buy it.

43
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Exactly.

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,560
Okay, so those three words you'll hear in today's dialogue and I think it's time we

45
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,200
listen to the dialogue.

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,360
Hello, Arthur.

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
What seems to be the problem?

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Hey, Doc.

49
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,200
Well, I think I might need glasses.

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
Sounds like you might be farsighted.

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Okay, then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
X-E-R-3?

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Question mark.

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:16,000
And I can't quite make out the other symbol, but I think it's the peace sign.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Wow, Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
Yeah, I know.

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,080
My vision is really blurry at times.

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,480
Okay, then.

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,440
Head over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,040
Thanks, Doc.

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,840
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,640
Well, this guy really has poor vision, hey?

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
Well, actually, you know what?

66
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,920
I've walked into the bathroom, the men's bathroom, actually, instead of the women's

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,040
bathroom and that's not because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

68
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,080
It's because you weren't paying attention.

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
That's true.

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,760
Okay, let's take a look today at our language takeaway.

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,720
Language takeaway.

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,960
The first word on our language takeaway for today is 20-20 vision.

73
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,800
20-20 vision.

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,320
20-20 vision.

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,240
If I have 20-20 vision...

76
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,320
It means that you have perfect vision.

77
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Which I do not have.

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,920
No, me neither.

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,080
So I usually wear glasses as well.

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,200
But yeah, people that have 20-20 vision don't need glasses.

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,720
They can see clearly.

82
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
And perfectly.

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
And perfectly.

84
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Yeah.

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Next word is far-sighted.

86
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Far-sighted.

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Far-sighted.

88
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Far-sighted.

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,000
So, if I'm far-sighted, I can't see very well, right?

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,320
So if you're far-sighted, you can't see things that are near.

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,480
So you can see things that are far away, but things that are close are blurry.

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Okay.

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
And the opposite would be?

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
Near-sighted.

95
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
And which is?

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,400
You can see things that are close well.

97
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
But not far.

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Yeah.

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay.

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Far-sighted and near-sighted.

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Okay.

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
So our next word is make out.

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Make out.

104
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,880
Make out.

105
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Make out.

106
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Make out.

107
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
That's kind of a funny little phrase.

108
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,280
And let's listen to a few examples of this phrase so we can understand how it's used.

109
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Example one.

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
I can't make out what this says.

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,380
The writing is too small.

112
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,040
Example two.

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,440
If you look carefully, you can almost make out a few of the stars in the sky.

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,720
Example three.

115
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,800
Can you see what's written on the sign there?

116
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
No.

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,680
I can't quite make it out.

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,980
Okay.

119
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,600
So basically, make out is to see clearly.

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Exactly.

121
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Make out.

123
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
To see.

124
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay.

125
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,080
And our last word for language takeaway today is blind as a bat.

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,760
Blind as a bat.

127
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,360
Blind as a bat.

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,040
So this is a really funny sounding expression.

129
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,200
One of these weird English idioms.

130
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Yeah.

131
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a really common expression that just means that you can't see.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Exactly.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,280
So it's not like you actually are blind, right?

134
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,160
But you just really can't see very well.

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Okay.

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
All right.

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,760
We saw four great words today in our language takeaway.

138
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,920
Now I think we can listen to our dialogue another time.

139
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,360
But this time, it's going to be slower so we can pick up all these great words that

140
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,000
we just talked about.

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hello, Arthur.

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,480
What seems to be the problem?

143
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,160
Hey, Doc.

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,880
Well, I think I might need glasses.

145
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,320
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

147
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,280
Sounds like you may be farsighted.

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
Okay, then.

149
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,920
Cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

150
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:06,560
X, E, R, 3, question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol, but I think it's

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
a peace sign.

152
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,360
Wow, Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

153
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Yeah, I know.

154
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,840
My vision is really blurry at times.

155
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760
Okay, then.

156
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,200
Head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

157
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,760
Thanks, Doc.

158
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,400
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

159
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
All right.

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
Great stuff on our dialogue.

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,520
And with this, we can start now with putting it together.

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,960
Putting it together.

163
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,920
So we saw a couple of useful phrases in this dialogue, and I think we can show you how

164
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,240
to use these phrases in a few different ways.

165
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
Right.

166
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,560
The first one that we have today is, what seems to be.

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,080
So we heard in the dialogue, the doctor said, what seems to be the problem.

168
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,640
We can use this same expression in a number of different ways.

169
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400
Let's listen.

170
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Example one.

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,160
What seems to be the problem?

172
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,760
Example two.

173
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,320
What seems to be the matter?

174
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,820
Example three.

175
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,040
What seems to be the trouble?

176
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,680
Okay, so with these examples, we can see how we can use the phrase, what seems to be, in

177
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
many different ways.

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,400
Yeah, it's a great way of asking, what's the problem?

179
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
So now, let's take a look at another phrase.

180
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,680
We heard in the dialogue, the doctor said, head on over to the other room.

181
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
Right.

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,560
And with this phrase, head on, we can combine it with other prepositions to indicate another

183
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
place.

184
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Exactly.

185
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
Let's hear three examples.

186
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Example one.

187
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,760
Head on in.

188
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,880
Example two.

189
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,360
Head on out.

190
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,680
Example three.

191
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Head on up.

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Okay, so for example, we can say, head on into the house, it's gonna rain soon.

193
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,440
Or we can say, hey guys, let's head on out to the park.

194
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,840
Or I can also say, head on up to my room, I'll be there in a second.

195
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Great.

196
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Those are some cool phrases.

197
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,240
Right, and they're real useful.

198
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,240
So why don't we listen to our dialogue and maybe we'll hear them again.

199
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,960
Hello Arthur, what seems to be the problem?

200
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Hey Doc.

201
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,800
Well, I think I might need glasses.

202
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

203
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,520
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

204
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Sounds like you might be farsighted.

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,640
Okay then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

206
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:59,960
X, E, R, 3, question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol, but I think it's

207
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,560
the peace sign.

208
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,680
Wow, Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

209
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah, I know.

210
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,920
My vision is really blurry at times.

211
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,960
Okay then, head over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your

212
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
prescription.

213
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,280
Thanks Doc.

214
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,760
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

215
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Okay, so talking about going to the eye doctor today, I have a question for our listeners.

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,080
A challenge for our listeners.

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,240
What's it called when you can't distinguish colors?

218
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,840
So like when you can't tell the difference between red and blue and green.

219
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Right.

220
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,760
So what is that condition called?

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
So there's like a technical term.

222
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,760
We want the technical term.

223
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,400
We want the technical term.

224
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,200
So we'll be looking for it on our comments page and be sure to, if you know the answer,

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
post it.

226
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
At EnglishPod.com.
