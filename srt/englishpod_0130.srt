00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today, I think we're hitting the gym, Marco.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,400
We need to be healthy.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,280
We've gained weight over the winter, I think.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
I think so.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,560
And being in an office, you know, it doesn't give you much opportunity to go and exercise

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,520
and really get a lot of work done during the day.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Exactly.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,520
So that's why we're going to the gym on this occasion.

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,400
We're going to be pumping some iron.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,800
We're going to be working out.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,800
So why don't we take a look at Vocabulary Preview and see what this means.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Vocabulary Preview.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
All right.

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,640
So, to pump iron, what does that mean?

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
All right.

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,080
Well, to pumping iron means lifting weights.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Okay.

22
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,280
So we're pumping iron.

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
We're lifting weights.

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,960
Because, you know, weights are made of iron.

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Right.

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
That's what makes them so heavy.

27
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
All right.

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
So we're pumping iron.

29
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Good.

30
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,200
And, well, we're going to be giving you guys some pointers.

31
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Pointers.

32
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Right.

33
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
All right.

34
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
So you might have heard the word point before.

35
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,920
And pointers is another word for tips.

36
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
All right.

37
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
So we're going to be giving you tips or advice.

38
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Yeah.

39
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,240
So you're going to get some help today from the trainer.

40
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
All right.

41
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
So we're going to jump right into this dialogue.

42
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:16,280
And when we come back, we'll be talking more about what's going on.

43
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Hey there.

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
You look a little lost.

45
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Are you new here?

46
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Yeah.

47
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,200
How did you know?

48
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,960
You can always spot the newbies.

49
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,800
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

50
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Were you trying to use this machine here?

51
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Yeah.

52
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,680
I just started my training today, and I'm not sure where to begin.

53
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
It's okay.

54
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,120
I know how it is.

55
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,800
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

56
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,960
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

58
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,920
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

59
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,400
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

60
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,160
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

61
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,080
Five kilo weights should be enough.

62
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,360
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron.

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,120
You might pull a muscle.

64
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Got it.

65
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Wow.

66
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Is that the weight you're lifting?

67
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,800
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

68
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
It's not that much.

69
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Just watch.

70
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm okay.

71
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,880
So this guy was a little bit arrogant.

72
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,640
I think he was very muscular, but I think he embarrassed himself in front of the lady.

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
The trainer, you mean?

74
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Yeah.

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Yeah, definitely.

76
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,040
So we say he had a big ego.

77
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
He thought a lot about himself.

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
So let's check out some of these phrases and words that they were using because they're

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,960
all related to going to the gym, and they can help you if you ever want to get some

80
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:51,000
help when you're at the gym.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
So this girl, she was new in the gym.

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
She didn't really know what she was doing.

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,840
And well, the guy said, well, do you want to develop strength or muscle tone?

84
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
All right.

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,160
We know what strength is, but what is muscle tone?

86
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Okay.

87
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,360
So if you want to develop muscle tone or to have muscle tone, it means that you have healthy

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,640
muscles, not like huge, big muscles, right?

89
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,920
But you have a nice body.

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Right.

91
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,640
So tone, to tone is to maybe give some shape to something.

92
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,080
Sometimes you have big arms and you can't see the muscles.

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,880
Well, muscle tone means that you can start to see the shape and they start to get stronger.

94
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
All right.

95
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,680
So if you think of Madonna, maybe five years ago, she had a lot of muscle tone.

96
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Now she's like big muscles.

97
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,720
But muscle tone means that you can see the muscles, they start to develop.

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Okay.

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,880
And this actually is very related to our next word because you said muscle tone and definition.

100
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Right.

101
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,400
So definition is another way for us to describe seeing those muscles because at first you

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
have a big tummy or you have big arms and when you start to work out, every time you

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,620
go, you can see more and more definition.

104
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,080
That means more and more of the muscle becomes visible.

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
All right.

106
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
So you have defined muscles.

107
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
All right.

108
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Good.

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,960
Now the girl was like, no, no, I don't want to be like super strong and huge.

110
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,080
She doesn't want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

111
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah, exactly.

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
She said, I just want a good physique.

113
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
All right.

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
So this word maybe sounds strange for some of you because it's more like French than

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
English.

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah.

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, it does come from French and physique is a way to talk about the whole body.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,140
You know, the physique is the state of your whole body.

119
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
It's your physical appearance.

120
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
Okay.

121
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,840
So I can say she has a nice physique.

122
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,200
So that means she's probably works out a lot.

123
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
So but basically it's like her whole body, right?

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,200
You can't just say like she has good physique in her arms or something like that.

125
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,080
And now your physique, physical, think of the word physical.

126
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
It's your whole body, your whole body.

127
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
All right.

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,320
So good physique.

129
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,120
And now the tips that he was giving her or the pointers, he was talking about these two

130
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,480
words reps and sets.

131
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Right.

132
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,760
These are great words for the gym because they, they allow us to count when we're working

133
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
out.

134
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,040
So the first one is reps or repetitions.

135
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,840
That means doing something over and over again.

136
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,560
So for example, if I want to lift a weight, I sit down on the bench, I do one, two, three.

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,280
How many times I lift that weight is a repetition or a rep.

138
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
All right.

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
And well, and what about sets?

140
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,640
So I could say I lift the weight 10 times, one, two, three, four, all the way to 10.

141
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,960
And then I wait and then I do it again.

142
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,200
So the number of times I do it again is a set.

143
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,720
So sets of 10 or sets of five.

144
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Okay.

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,000
So if you are lifting this weight 10 times and you have five sets, you will do a total

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,520
of 50 pushes or lifts or repetitions.

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Okay.

148
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,880
So reps and sets are probably the most important or common words you'll hear in the gym, especially

149
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,040
if you're lifting weights.

150
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Right.

151
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Definitely.

152
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,520
And sometimes your trainer will count with you so that he'll, he'll keep a count while

153
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
you're working out.

154
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Cool.

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,120
So those are the words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,320
I think in order to better understand these words, we should listen to our dialogue again,

157
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:20,280
but we're going to slow it down just a little bit.

158
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,480
Hey there.

159
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,060
You look a little lost.

160
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Are you new here?

161
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Yeah.

162
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
How did you know?

163
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,200
You can always spot the newbies.

164
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,320
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

165
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,600
Were you trying to use this machine here?

166
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Yeah.

167
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
I just started my training today.

168
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm not really sure where to begin.

169
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
It's okay.

170
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,740
I know how it is.

171
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,000
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,920
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

173
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,320
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

174
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,060
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

175
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,260
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

176
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,440
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

177
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,120
Five kilo weights should be enough.

178
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Now, it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.

179
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Got it.

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Wow.

181
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Is that the weight you're lifting?

182
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,120
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

183
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
It's not that much.

184
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Just watch.

185
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm okay.

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
All right.

187
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,440
So, you might have heard some other phrases in there that sound interesting or new to

188
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
you.

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,600
That's why we're going to go into the fluency builder part of the lesson where we can talk

190
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,040
about sounding more fluent in English.

191
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Fluency builder.

192
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
All right.

193
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,440
So, the girl, she was a little bit lost, right?

194
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,240
So, this guy was trying to help her out.

195
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,680
I think it was her first time in the gym.

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,240
It was.

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
She doesn't really know where to start, which is a common problem for people who go to the

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
gym for the first time.

199
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,800
So, the guy said, well, yeah, I know how it is.

200
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
How what is?

201
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Exactly.

202
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
How what is?

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
It's a very strange phrase because it's vague.

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
It's not clear.

205
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,280
So, what is he referring to?

206
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,440
This is something very common that we say in English to mean, I understand your situation.

207
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I know how you feel.

208
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
I know how you feel.

209
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,880
So, she says, this is my first time.

210
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,360
I don't know what to do.

211
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,040
And he says, I know how it is.

212
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
I understand your situation.

213
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,600
Right, because I imagine the first time he went to the gym, he felt the same way.

214
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Exactly.

215
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Or I could say, I'm so lost.

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm new at this school.

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't even know anyone.

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,560
Yeah, I know how it is.

219
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,840
I was new here last year.

220
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,760
So, trust me, I know how it is.

221
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Okay.

222
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,400
So, Marco and I have similar situations, although he has already experienced it.

223
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,880
So, he can help me out.

224
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
This is a good phrase.

225
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,640
It's actually, I think it's very common for somebody to kind of sympathize with you.

226
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Absolutely.

227
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,280
And it's a really good phrase if you want to help someone who looks lost or confused.

228
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,680
So, if someone joins your work, if you have a new colleague, and they say, oh, I don't

229
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
know where anything is.

230
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
I don't know how to do anything at my job.

231
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,760
You say, oh, I know how it is.

232
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,840
I was new here last month.

233
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Great.

234
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,280
And, well, now they were talking about, you know, lifting weights and the physique.

235
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,600
And she said this interesting word.

236
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
She says, I don't want to be ripped like you.

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Okay.

238
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,760
And many of you have probably heard the other meaning of the word to rip or ripped.

239
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,000
So, this is to rip.

240
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Yeah, to tear.

241
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,200
But in this case, it's an adjective.

242
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,720
It's a way to describe someone's physique, their body.

243
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,360
And we're talking about people who are very, very muscular.

244
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Okay.

245
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,840
So, basically, bodybuilders.

246
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
Arnold Schwarzenegger is ripped.

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,160
He has huge muscles.

248
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,460
Madonna is ripped.

249
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,800
She has huge muscles.

250
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Okay.

251
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
So, it's a very informal way, but it's a very informal way of saying very muscular.

252
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Yeah.

253
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,840
It's someone who works out a lot.

254
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
All right.

255
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
You're ripped.

256
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,400
And after this, we've got one more phrase.

257
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,000
It's actually very important because when we talk about going to the gym, working out,

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,480
we have to talk about safety and your health as well.

259
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240
It's very easy to hurt yourself.

260
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Right.

261
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,280
And that's what we want to avoid.

262
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,240
You don't want to pull a muscle.

263
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
All right.

264
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Pull a muscle.

265
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,280
And this is a key phrase here because we have a special combination of verb and noun.

266
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,520
The thing that we pull is our muscle.

267
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,560
And what we do to it is we pull it.

268
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,760
That means we hurt it.

269
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
So if you don't stretch and you're lifting weights, maybe your muscle will start to hurt

270
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
and you can't lift anymore.

271
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Yeah.

272
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
You hurt it.

273
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
You pulled your muscle.

274
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
You pulled a muscle.

275
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Or often runners have this problem.

276
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,700
They don't stretch before they run or they run too much.

277
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,600
And they have a lot of pain in their muscles.

278
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,320
You say, I pulled a muscle.

279
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,400
Now, I think there's another way of saying it also is to tear a muscle, right?

280
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Tear is more serious.

281
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
More serious.

282
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,640
A tear is like a little rip in your muscle and you should really see a doctor about that.

283
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Okay.

284
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
So we don't want you to pull a muscle or to tear a muscle.

285
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,920
So be sure to stretch.

286
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,560
But we have some more examples with this phrase, to pull a muscle.

287
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,920
So let's listen.

288
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,000
Example one.

289
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Physical strains also called pull muscles are common sports injuries.

290
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,360
Example two.

291
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,560
If you do not warm up before a physical activity, you can easily pull a muscle.

292
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,000
Example three.

293
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,840
Anyone can pull a muscle because of overuse, muscle fatigue or through a fall.

294
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,280
Alright so now that that's clear, I think we can listen to our gym dialer one more time

295
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,760
and see what happens to this arrogant bodybuilder.

296
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Absolutely.

297
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Hey there.

298
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
You look a little lost.

299
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Are you new here?

300
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Yeah.

301
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
How did you know?

302
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
You can always spot the newbies.

303
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

304
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Were you trying to use this machine here?

305
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Yeah.

306
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
I just started my training today and I'm not sure where to begin.

307
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
It's okay.

308
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I know how it is.

309
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps, and

310
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
your glutes.

311
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
So you can do a lot of different exercises.

312
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
I'm going to show you how to do a few exercises.

313
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
So I'm going to start with a squat.

314
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

315
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

316
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

317
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

318
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:10,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

319
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

320
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

321
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:43,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

322
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

323
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I'm going to start with a squat.

324
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,680
I like to run and I often use the treadmill.

325
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,680
And I've never really understood the people

326
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,480
who don't run on the treadmill,

327
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,760
people who stand or who walk slowly.

328
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,260
And I remember my gym is usually very crowded.

329
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,040
I remember one time I was at my gym

330
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,640
and I wanted to run on the treadmill.

331
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,040
I had a long day at work and I had to go out afterwards.

332
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
So I didn't have much time.

333
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,380
I only had an hour and I really wanted to run,

334
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,160
but there's a line for the treadmills.

335
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
There are too many people.

336
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,840
And this particular day I was waiting

337
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
and waiting and waiting.

338
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,760
And finally it was my turn and I stepped

339
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,520
and a woman cut in front of me.

340
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,560
No.

341
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,280
She cut in front of me and I was so angry.

342
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,000
And what did she do?

343
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
In her heels.

344
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Heels?

345
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
Heels, big shoes.

346
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,440
She walked for 40 minutes.

347
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh my God.

348
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,800
You could go outside and walk.

349
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,640
I wanna run.

350
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,720
But she was wearing heels at the gym.

351
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
In her heels at the gym.

352
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,060
Wow, well, I guess you have to look nice

353
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
when you go to the gym also.

354
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,000
Apparently, apparently.

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,280
It is a very popular place for people to meet, right?

356
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
To start dating.

357
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,940
It is.

358
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,160
They say after the office, the gym is one

359
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,640
of the most common places for people

360
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,040
to meet their boyfriends and girlfriends.

361
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,960
Wow, so there's another good reason

362
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
why you should go to the gym.

363
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,200
Absolutely, yeah.

364
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,520
All right, so that's all the time we have for today,

365
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,000
but we would like to hear if you have any questions,

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,240
any doubts or comments.

367
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,660
So come to our site, EnglishPod.com.

368

And if you have any gym stories,
