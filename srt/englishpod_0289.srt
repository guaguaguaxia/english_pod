00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,680
My name is Catherine and today we have part 7 of our series all about giving a presentation

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
in English.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
That's right.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,400
So obviously not every presentation is going to go perfectly.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,080
Sometimes we do have some problems and on this occasion we're going to take a look at

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640
tech problems and how to handle them.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
That's right.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,960
So you're going to learn some great ways to discuss and to explain technical problems.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,840
Okay so if we could dim the lights Jonathan we can kick off with the first TV advert.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,140
Please note that we're still in the early days with this advert so it might seem a bit

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,880
rough around the edges.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,040
Okay so I just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Hmm.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,440
Sorry about this.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,920
Bear with me a second.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,000
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let me see.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,240
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,720
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,560
Let me check the connection a second.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,480
Well the connection seems okay and the computer is running normally.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Hmm.

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Okay.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,620
Sorry guys.

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,360
Obviously a problem with the system.

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,240
Let's just reboot and start over.

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,560
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
Right let's try again.

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,120
No still nothing Michael.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,720
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,120
We might need to cool it down for 10 minutes and start again.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,160
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Okay guys.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,380
Unfortunately technical problems do crop up from time to time don't they?

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,880
But it's not a huge problem.

40
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,840
In the meantime while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more about

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:03,240
the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,320
Alright so we're back and now let's take a look at five keywords that we've picked out

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,040
for you on Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,280
Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay so we have some phrasal verbs today.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,120
The first one is to kick off.

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
That's right.

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
Mr. Ford started out by saying that we can kick off the first TV advert.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,360
So this phrasal verb to kick off, what does it mean?

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,000
It means to start something.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,840
So to kick it off means to start.

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,620
So I can say tonight we're kicking off the party at 8 o'clock.

53
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,620
That's right.

54
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,800
Or let's kick off this new product with a big party.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
That's right.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Okay.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
So the phrasal verb to kick off.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,760
You've probably also seen it in sports.

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,040
I think in soccer you have the kickoff which is the same thing.

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,520
That's right except it's a noun.

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,040
So be careful with that one.

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,680
The kickoff is the very beginning of the game.

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
Okay very good.

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,160
In that same paragraph towards the end, we see Mr. Ford saying okay so I just need to

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,520
click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Pop.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Right.

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
I like this verb actually because it makes me think of that.

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,240
That when you're using a computer and you have these little windows or these little

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,920
icons, those little pictures, when something changes, they appear quickly.

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,400
And that means in computer talk, it means to pop up.

72
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
That's right.

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
You obviously maybe heard of this already.

74
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
You have annoying pop-ups.

75
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Maybe you visit a website and all of a sudden these new windows start to open.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
They're all advertisements.

77
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,520
You buy this, buy this, buy this, buy this.

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,140
Those are pop-ups.

79
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,880
But also you can have a pop-up in a chat window for example.

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,760
And in this case, we also use it as a verb.

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,360
It should pop up.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,760
So to pop up.

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
To appear.

84
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
To appear.

85
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
All right very good.

86
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,320
Now obviously it didn't work.

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,160
Something was happening with the projector and Mr. Ford was going through maybe some

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,360
of the problems and he said let me check the connection a second.

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,520
Well the connection seems okay.

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,160
Okay connection is a very important noun especially when we're talking about technical things

91
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,440
like computers.

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,320
You can have an internet connection.

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,200
This means how you are able to use the internet.

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,360
But in this case we're talking about a projector which makes things bigger and a computer.

95
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,440
And so those things need to have a connection.

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,920
They need to have a cord or something that you plug into one and to the other so that

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
they can talk to each other.

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
That's right.

99
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,160
So as you notice, we are using it as a noun.

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,900
They need to have, the computer and the projector needs to have a connection.

101
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,360
So you have the verb to connect but then you have the noun a connection.

102
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,440
All right and let's move on to another possible solution.

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,560
Mr. Ford suggests rebooting the system.

104
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Okay so the verb here to reboot is another special computer word that means to turn off

105
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
and turn on again.

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,180
To restart.

107
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,920
So if I say reboot, I'm using the prefix there re which means a repetition or to do it again.

108
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,080
If I just say boot, can I say just I need to boot the computer?

109
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
I need to boot up the computer.

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
Okay, boot up.

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
That's right.

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,520
So in this case, you would be talking about a computer that is off and you want to turn

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
it on.

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,400
So I would say, hey Marco, can you boot up the computer for me?

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,960
Now about using the word reboot or to boot up, it's usually for electronic things, electric

116
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
things.

117
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,840
You wouldn't say to reboot your car or to boot up your car.

118
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,080
No, this is for computers specifically electronics.

119
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,200
For example, oh man, my iPhone just froze.

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,440
I need to reboot it.

121
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,960
Okay, very good.

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,920
All right and for our last phrasal verb for today on Language Takeaway, we have towards

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,440
the end of the dialogue, towards the end of the dialogue, Mr. Ford apologizes and says,

124
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,360
you know what, I'm sorry but technical problems do crop up sometimes.

125
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,560
Okay so this verb to crop up means to appear or to happen but not all the time.

126
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,840
So unexpectedly or occasionally.

127
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
That's right.

128
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,160
So these things do crop up sometimes.

129
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,280
It means every once in a while this problem will happen.

130
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
So can I use this for a person?

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
If you say, oh you scared me, you cropped up on me.

132
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,640
No, it'd be creeped up on me.

133
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Creeped up, very good.

134
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,080
So we can't confuse those two but they sound very similar.

135
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,640
They do sound similar but to crop up is usually a problem or an event or a thing that happens

136
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,880
and it happens not very often.

137
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,400
Okay, very good.

138
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,280
So I think we've taken a look at a lot of words here, specifically phrasal verbs.

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,680
So let's review those.

140
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,560
Let's listen to our dialogue again.

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Okay so if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,800
Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert so it might seem a bit

143
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
rough around the edges.

144
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Okay so I just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

145
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Hmm, sorry about this.

146
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,680
Bear with me a second.

147
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,640
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

148
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Let me see.

149
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:23,920
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

150
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,380
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

151
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,240
Let me check the connection a second.

152
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,120
Well the connection seems okay and the computer is running normally.

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Hmm.

154
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
Okay, sorry guys.

155
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Obviously a problem with the system.

156
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,920
Let's just reboot and start over.

157
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,800
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

158
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,480
Right, let's try again.

159
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,760
No, still nothing, Michael.

160
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,360
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

161
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,680
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

162
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,760
We might need to cool it down for 10 minutes and start again.

163
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,040
Okay guys, unfortunately technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,520
But it's not a huge problem.

166
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,300
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more

167
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:20,720
about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.

168
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,640
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

169
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Fluency Builder.

170
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,640
So this first phrase we have is very important, especially when we're using video or a projector

171
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
in a presentation.

172
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,520
We say, let's dim the lights.

173
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
That's right.

174
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,280
So we have the verb to dim.

175
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,240
So to dim something is to make it darker.

176
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,400
But not turn it off completely.

177
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
No.

178
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,200
It means maybe to lower the lights.

179
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
We could actually see this on a computer also when the screen is very, very bright.

180
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,520
We say, oh it's too bright.

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,880
I need you to dim it a little.

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
Make it a little bit darker.

183
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Okay.

184
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,160
So you can use this verb to dim to make it a little bit darker or to make it lower in

185
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,400
intensity.

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
That's right.

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Dim the color, dim the lights.

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,160
Alright, very good.

189
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,920
Now Mr. Ford when he was talking about the advert, he said, well it's new and it's not

190
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,560
ready yet completely.

191
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
So it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Okay.

193
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,240
This is a very, very popular phrase that means that something is incomplete.

194
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Maybe it's not perfect yet.

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
It needs some work.

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Okay.

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,820
So if maybe you're designing a new website and it's maybe 50% done.

198
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,340
So you say the website is almost finished, but it's still rough around the edges.

199
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,960
We need to make some changes to fix it.

200
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
That's right.

201
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,200
Rough around the edges is a phrase that is the opposite of the word polished.

202
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,280
Something is polished if it's perfect and ready to go.

203
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Okay.

204
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,640
And well, when the technical problem started, Mr. Ford was apologizing and said, hey, look,

205
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,480
And he also used this interesting phrase, bear with me.

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Bear with me a second.

208
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Okay.

209
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,600
So this is interesting because it's not the animal, the bear.

210
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Right, right.

211
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
This is different.

212
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
It's more like, excuse me, please be patient.

213
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,400
I have to do something and you have to wait.

214
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,960
So this is a very, very polite way of asking some people or some person to wait for you.

215
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
To tolerate.

216
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Yes.

217
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,760
So both the animal bear and to bear with me are spelled the same way.

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,520
It looks exactly like the animal, but we're not talking about the animal.

219
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,000
No, we're asking someone to tolerate something that's annoying or frustrating.

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,960
For example, I'm trying to show you a file on my computer, Marco.

222
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
My computer's not working.

223
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
I say, please bear with me a second.

224
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,640
I have to reboot my computer.

225
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
I have to wait here.

226
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Okay.

227
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Very good.

228
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,400
Now, towards the end of the dialogue, when we talked about to crop up, the second part

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,440
of that, Mr. Ford said, unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time.

230
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,200
So we already discussed cropped up.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
What is time to time?

232
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
From time to time.

233
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Okay.

234
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,920
So that's a set phrase because we said already that you could also say sometimes.

235
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,860
So from time to time means every once in a while or occasionally.

236
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,160
So it's an adverbial phrase.

237
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,260
It's a way of telling people how often something happens, but in this case, it's not very common.

238
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,160
So for example, you can say, I like to go to the movies from time to time.

239
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
That's right.

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,360
So maybe once or twice a month, you like to go to the movies.

241
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,680
But what if I come to work every day?

242
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,280
Do I come to work from time to time?

243
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
No.

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Right.

245
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Okay.

246
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,360
So from time to time is rarely or occasionally, not very often.

247
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Exactly.

248
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
All right.

249
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Very good.

250
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,840
So now let's listen to our dialogue one last time and review everything we've just learned.

251
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,800
Okay.

252
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,200
So if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
Please note that we're still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a

254
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
bit rough around the edges.

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

256
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,880
So I just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

257
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Hmm.

258
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,840
Sorry about this.

259
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
Bear with me a second.

260
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,320
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

261
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Let me see.

262
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:27,600
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

263
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,080
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

264
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,160
Let me check the connection a second.

265
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,760
Well, the connection seems okay and the computer is running normally.

266
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Hmm.

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Okay.

268
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Sorry, guys.

269
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,680
Obviously a problem with the system.

270
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,600
Let's just reboot and start over.

271
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,720
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

272
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,080
Right.

273
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Let's try again.

274
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,400
No, still nothing, Michael.

275
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,000
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

277
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,400
We might need to cool it down for 10 minutes and start again.

278
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,760
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

279
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay, guys.

280
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,680
Unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

281
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,160
But it's not a huge problem.

282
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,960
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more

283
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,240
about the advertising concept and what we're looking to achieve overall with this campaign.

284
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,960
All right.

285
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,280
So this was part seven of our presentation series.

286
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,320
And actually, these type of problems occur very, very often, specifically with the laptop

287
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
and the projector.

288
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,720
And sometimes it doesn't work.

289
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
It doesn't recognize it.

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,920
And so this is a nice way of handling it.

291
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
This is.

292
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,960
And we hope that these are phrases that you can use in your daily life as well.

293
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,320
Maybe you're working with your colleagues and you're having some technical problems.

294
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,480
Or if you're having a problem and someone gives you instructions for how to solve that

295
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
problem.

296
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,200
Like, I often get this from my technical team.

297
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,640
I say, listen, I have a problem.

298
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,240
And they say, hey, just reboot your computer and it will be okay.

299
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,040
So these are very, very common issues that I think that you can learn how to describe

300
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,600
in English with today's lesson.

301
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
All right.

302
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Very good.

303
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,640
And of course, if you guys have any questions or any doubts about this or any of our lessons,

304
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,920
please come to our website EnglishPod.com.

305
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,120
On the lessons page, you can leave your comments and questions.

306
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
And we'll see you guys next time.

307
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Bye.
