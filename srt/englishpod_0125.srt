1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,400
Welcome to another lesson at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Katerina My name is Katerin.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,440
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,220
Marco Today, we're going to be talking about a popular

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,160
topic all over the world and that is smoking.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,360
Katerina Well, not so popular in the States right

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
now, to be honest.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Marco Well, that's the thing.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,160
In every country in the world now, they are becoming more strict on smoking and where

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
you can smoke.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,680
So, it's becoming very difficult for smokers nowadays.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,160
Katerina Well, it's a good reason to want to quit.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Marco And that's what we're going to be talking

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
about today is quitting smoking.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
Katerina Well, before we get going, we do have a really

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,480
important phrase that we should preview in today's vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,160
Vocabulary Preview Marco Alright, so on vocabulary preview, we're

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,960
going to take a look at this word pack of smokes.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,640
Katerina Pack of smokes.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
So, Marco A pack of smokes.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,560
Katerina So, smokes is a word for cigarettes.

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,680
It's the same thing, smokes or cigarettes.

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
Marco Right, but a pack is, you know, like 20 cigarettes.

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,920
Katerina It's a box of cigarettes.

27
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,240
You buy them in a pack.

28
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,040
You don't just buy one at a time.

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,400
So, again, the phrase is pack of smokes.

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,640
Marco Pack of smokes.

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,160
So, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what's going on with

32
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
this smoker.

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:28,040
Smoker Ah, it smells like an ashtray in here.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,200
Smoker Hi, honey.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
What's wrong?

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,440
Why do you have that look on your face?

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Smoker What's wrong?

38
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,720
I thought we agreed you were going to quit smoking.

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
Smoker No.

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,160
I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,680
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,280
Katerina Look, there are other ways to quit.

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,760
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,160
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month, and now laws are cracking down and not allowing

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,560
smoking in any public place.

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,520
It's not like you can just light up like before.

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Smoker I know, I know.

48
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,600
I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,980
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee

50
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,480
or after lunch.

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Please understand.

52
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Katerina Fine.

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,800
I want a divorce.

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:23,160
Katerina Sorry, I just smoked a pack of cigarettes.

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,920
Smoker You do smoke, don't you?

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
Katerina Well, we'll talk about that later.

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,200
Smoker Alright, so it is a little bit extreme, though.

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,760
I mean, he's divorcing her because she won't quit.

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,600
Katerina Well, some people really are health conscious

60
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,440
and are afraid of the negative side of smoking, which has a lot of health side effects.

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Smoker Yeah.

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,960
Well, as he was complaining about all the negative effects and the negative aspects

63
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,160
of smoking, he did mention, both of them mentioned a lot of great words and phrases.

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,040
So why don't we take a look at them now in Language Takeaway?

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,200
Katerina Language Takeaway.

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,520
Well, this first word is a word that's very important for any smoker who goes to a bar

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,440
or restaurant and needs to put the ash somewhere, right?

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,520
So when you smoke, there's some ash, there's some messy, dirty stuff, and you need an ashtray

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
to collect it.

70
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Smoker An ashtray.

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,680
Katerina So an ashtray is something that's usually

72
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,120
round or square and you put it on a table and it's just very helpful to keep the house

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,760
clean or restaurant clean.

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,920
So if you're in a restaurant, you say, hey, can I have an ashtray, please?

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,520
Smoker So the residue or the stuff that when you're

76
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,080
smoking it comes out the gray, I don't know, like dust, it's called ash.

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,160
Katerina Right.

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,400
And this is a tray.

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,360
But the complaint here is, it smells like an ashtray in here.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,160
That means it smells really, really bad in here.

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,560
Smoker Yeah, it smells like cigarettes.

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Katerina Yeah.

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
So that word again is ashtray.

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Smoker Ashtray.

85
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
All right.

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,280
Well, and the guy was complaining and he said, well, I thought you were going to quit smoking.

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,280
And she said, no, no, I said I was going to cut down.

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Katerina She says it's very different from quitting

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
smoking.

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,920
So Marco, maybe we should talk about how cutting down and quitting are different.

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Smoker All right.

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,880
So if I say I'm going to cut down on smoking, it's just I'm going to smoke less.

93
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Katerina Okay, so let's take an example.

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,600
I smoke 10 cigarettes a day, but I want to cut down.

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
How many should I smoke later?

96
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Maybe?

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Smoker Like two or three.

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Katerina Two or three.

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,540
Smoker Instead of quitting.

100
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,800
So if you quit smoking, that would mean zero.

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Katerina Zero cigarettes, no smoking anymore.

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Smoker Right.

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Katerina All right.

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,920
So you can also cut down on carbs like carbohydrates.

105
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,480
So some people who cut down on carbs eat less bread.

106
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,440
They don't eat any pasta.

107
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,880
So these are really good ways of trying to talk about dieting as well as smoking.

108
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Smoker Right.

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,640
And I think we have a couple of examples of other ways we can use this phrase cut down.

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,600
So let's listen to them now.

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Example 1.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Our company has decided to cut down our workload.

113
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,440
So from now on, we leave at 3pm every Friday.

114
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,120
Example 2.

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
You should really cut down on the amount of salt you eat.

116
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,080
It's not good for you.

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
Example 3.

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,360
My doctor told me I need to cut down on fatty foods because of my heart condition.

119
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Katerina And when you want to smoke a cigarette, you

120
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,040
have to do something first with some fires.

121
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,520
We call this lighting up.

122
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,080
Smoker To light up.

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,720
Katerina So lighting up, it doesn't mean turning on

124
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
the light.

125
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,560
It actually means using a lighter or some fire to start your cigarette.

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Smoker Right.

127
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,760
So you want to light up with the lighter matches or some sort of fire.

128
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Katerina The man says, the husband says, it's not

129
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,160
like you can just light up like before.

130
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
That means it's not like you can just smoke like before.

131
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,600
So in some cases, light up means to smoke a cigarette.

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,360
We're in a movie theater and someone lights a cigarette and I say, oh, you can't light

133
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
up in here.

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Smoker Right.

135
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
So you can't smoke in here.

136
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Katerina You can't smoke in here.

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,860
Smoker It's another way of saying smoking.

138
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,860
Very good.

139
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,840
And she was explaining, you know, how difficult it is and she's trying to quit.

140
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,120
But she said, I don't have the willpower to just quit.

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,400
Katerina Ooh, willpower.

142
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
So this is an important word.

143
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Smoker Willpower.

144
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Katerina Willpower.

145
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,160
You think of the main part of this word is will.

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
That means the desire to do something.

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
You want to do something.

148
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,240
Smoker So if I have willpower, I have strong willpower.

149
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
What am I saying?

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
Katerina You're saying that you can make a decision and you can follow your decision.

151
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,360
So I decide not to eat cake.

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,600
I have very strong willpower, so I never eat cake.

153
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,860
If I don't have strong willpower, maybe I sometimes secretly eat cake in the middle

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,240
of the night from my refrigerator.

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200
Smoker So that happens, right?

156
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
Sometimes you don't have strong enough willpower.

157
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
So you kind of eat a little bit of cake when nobody's watching.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Katerina Exactly.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
And you can have willpower about lots of different things.

160
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,280
So this is a great word again to use when you're talking about dieting or smoking or

161
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
drinking.

162
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Smoker Any type of maybe temptation.

163
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Katerina Exactly.

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Smoker All right.

165
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,240
And well, she said she had this urge to reach for her pack of smokes.

166
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,200
Katerina Ooh, urge is another good one.

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,120
It's very similar to willpower, but an urge is kind of like a physical feeling that makes

168
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
you want to do something.

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,760
Smoker So you have like this strong desire.

170
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,120
Katerina So I have the urge to go swimming today.

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,920
I don't know why, but I really want to.

172
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Smoker All right.

173
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,360
You have an urge.

174
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Interesting word.

175
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,880
Katerina Pregnant women often have these kinds of things

176
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
too.

177
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
I have the urge to do something.

178
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
We also call them cravings.

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
Smoker Oh, cravings or urge to do something.

180
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
All right.

181
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Interesting.

182
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,840
So we've taken a look at these five great words, and I think we should listen to our

183
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
dialogue again.

184
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,560
We're going to slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and talk some

185
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
more.

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,760
OK, let's listen.

187
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,600
Katerina Ugh, it smells like an ashtray in here.

188
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Smoker Hi honey.

189
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
What's wrong?

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
Why do you have that look on your face?

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,920
Katerina What's wrong?

192
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I thought we agreed that you were going to quit smoking.

193
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
Smoker No.

194
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,800
I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

195
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,200
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

196
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,040
Katerina Look, there are other ways to quit.

197
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,440
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

198
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,720
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month, and now laws are cracking down and not allowing

199
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
smoking in any public place.

200
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,800
It's not like you can just light up like before.

201
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,240
Smoker I know, I know.

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,320
I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

203
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,960
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee

204
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
or after lunch.

205
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Please understand.

206
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Katerina Fine.

207
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I want a divorce.

208
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,280
And we are back.

209
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,920
So we have a great part of our show where we like to talk about some phrases that help

210
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,560
you attain fluency.

211
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,280
That means sounding like a native speaker of English.

212
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,840
And today's phrases are wonderful.

213
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,320
Enrique Alright, so let's take a look at them now

214
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,400
in Fluency Builder.

215
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,640
Fluency Builder Enrique So on Fluency Builder today, let's take

216
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,400
a look at two different phrases.

217
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,000
And let's start with the first one.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,520
She mentioned something about going cold turkey overnight.

219
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
What is that phrase?

220
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Cold turkey?

221
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,360
Katerina Now this is a very strange phrase.

222
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,880
So first of all, why would a turkey be cold?

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
They have lots of feathers.

224
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,440
And second of all, what does it have to do with cigarettes?

225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Enrique Right.

226
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,120
So if I say I'm going cold turkey, what is that?

227
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,140
Katerina So just take this as a phrase.

228
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't think about the actual words because they won't make sense in this context.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,960
What we're talking about is quitting smoking entirely.

230
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,200
You're not going to cut down.

231
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,600
It means today I'm not going to smoke at all and I'm never going to smoke again.

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,960
That means never ever will I smoke another cigarette.

233
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
So it's cold turkey.

234
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,320
Enrique So if I go cold turkey, it means I stop doing

235
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,560
something immediately and suddenly and forever.

236
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Katerina Entirely.

237
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Enrique Alright.

238
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,080
Katerina You can use this phrase for different habits, different things that you do like

239
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,880
drinking, for example, or cutting down on sugar.

240
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
But generally we just say this about cigarettes.

241
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,400
Enrique So it's mostly related to smoking.

242
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Going cold turkey.

243
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,600
Katerina Some people like to smoke less, like one

244
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,040
cigarette a day or one cigarette a week.

245
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,840
But going cold turkey is supposed to be the hardest.

246
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Enrique Right.

247
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Okay.

248
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Going cold turkey.

249
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Alright.

250
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,480
And well, he was explaining the different negative aspects of smoking.

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,080
He said, well, you know, they spend a fortune on cigarettes every month.

252
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,020
And he said, laws are cracking down.

253
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,800
So if the laws are cracking down, what is he trying to say there?

254
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,680
Katerina Well, this is actually a very interesting

255
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,520
point because in America right now, it's very hard to smoke in public places.

256
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,680
So this means that the government is trying to stop people from smoking.

257
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,720
So they say, no more smoking in public places, no more smoking in restaurants, no more smoking

258
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,880
in bars.

259
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,680
And so this means they're cracking down.

260
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
They're making it harder to do something.

261
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Enrique So they are becoming more strict.

262
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,080
I think for this phrase, we should listen to a couple of more examples just to make

263
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,960
sure we understand it.

264
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,160
Katerina Example one.

265
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,760
Enrique The police are cracking down on drunk driving

266
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
in our city.

267
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,400
Katerina Example two.

268
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,720
Enrique Our school has really started to crack down

269
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
on tardiness.

270
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Katerina Example three.

271
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,800
Enrique The president has passed a law that will

272
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,040
crack down possession of illegal substances.

273
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,280
Enrique Alright, so the government is cracking down.

274
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Laws are cracking down.

275
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,600
Katerina Yeah, exactly.

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,320
So this is an important one because you read this in the newspapers as well about certain

277
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,960
laws and police action.

278
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,420
Enrique Alright, great.

279
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,880
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time and then we'll

280
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,840
come back and talk a little bit more about this vice.

281
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:26,480
Katerina Ah, it smells like an ashtray in here.

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:38,760
Enrique I know, I know.

283
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,920
I really am trying but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

284
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,320
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,960
or after lunch.

286
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Please understand.

287
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,920
Katerina Fine, I want a divorce.

288
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,320
So do you have a problem with this vice as you call it?

289
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
Are you a smoker?

290
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
Enrique I'm really not.

291
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,600
I'm the type of person that could maybe smoke socially like if we go out to a bar with drinks,

292
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
a social smoker like they call it, right?

293
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,040
Katerina Yeah, I'm jealous.

294
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Enrique But not really.

295
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,520
You're a habitual smoker, right?

296
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Katerina Right.

297
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Well, I was.

298
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm trying to cut down.

299
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,080
So as a habitual smoker, I often smoked every day.

300
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,720
Sometimes I smoked a lot and sometimes I smoked less.

301
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,280
But right now I'm in a period where I'm mostly quit.

302
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,640
Enrique Okay, almost.

303
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,920
Katerina Yeah, well, I haven't smoked in a while.

304
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
And when I do, it's just one cigarette.

305
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
Enrique Now, it is interesting because like we mentioned,

306
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,640
laws are cracking down on where you can smoke.

307
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,080
But also taxes and cigarettes are becoming much more expensive, right?

308
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,440
Katerina Absolutely, especially where I'm from in Chicago.

309
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,400
It's easy to spend maybe 10 US dollars or 12 US dollars on one pack of cigarettes.

310
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,640
Enrique On a pack of cigarettes.

311
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Imagine that.

312
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,040
So then you have people that can't help smoking one or two packs a day.

313
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,600
So how much is that a month?

314
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
It's just an amazing amount of money.

315
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Katerina Thousands of dollars.

316
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,800
Well, and I have to say, though, a lot of my friends who used to smoke in America have

317
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
quit.

318
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
So this is maybe working.

319
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,440
Enrique The whole thing of making cigarettes more

320
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
expensive.

321
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Katerina Yeah, making them much more expensive.

322
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,360
Enrique Now, another interesting thing, and what

323
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,200
I was reading recently, is that you know those warnings that come on cigarette packs that

324
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,520
say smoking kales, smoking causes cancer.

325
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,600
Actually a study has proven that it's not effective, that people don't mind it or even

326
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,280
worry about the cautions on the cigarette packages.

327
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,560
Katerina Well, as a smoker, I could say that, yeah,

328
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,000
you generally, if you're going to smoke a cigarette, don't look at the label that much.

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,480
You just, you know, you throw it in your bag and you forget about it.

330
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Enrique But it's actually gotten to the point where

331
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,960
people choose the cigarette pack based on the picture.

332
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,200
So it's like, oh yeah, give me the one with the black lungs or give me that one.

333
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Katerina Oh, God.

334
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Enrique Yeah, it's interesting.

335
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,080
So it's not really working.

336
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,800
I guess we're going to have to find other ways to make people more conscious about this

337
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
vice.

338
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Katerina We should.

339
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
Enrique But come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

340
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,720
Tell us what you think about this vice, smoking.

341
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Is it good?

342
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Is it bad?

343
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,240
Are you a habitual smoker or just a social smoker?

344
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,800
Katerina Yeah, we also have lots of great stuff, tools

345
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,480
for you on our website and expansion sentences and all that stuff that helps you continue

346
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,040

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
So check it out.

348
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,200
Let us know what you think.

349
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
