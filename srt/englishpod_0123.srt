1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,240
Welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,240
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,560
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,320
And today we're looking at another one of our lessons for English of the past decades.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
And this time, it's the 1990s.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,680
Well, you know, the 1990s is a little easier for most of us to remember.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,040
Yeah, I guess it's a little bit more recent.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,640
We're going to be looking at a lot of language that is still used today.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,240
Most of these words and phrases are still used today.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,640
So they're going to be very useful.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,000
And you're going to sound a lot more native.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,840
A lot cooler as well, huh?

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Right.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,800
So before we get started with this lesson, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,560
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,960
Now the first one is a mall.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
A mall.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
M-A-L-L, mall.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,360
All right, so a mall is basically short for shopping mall.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,680
And a shopping mall is a big building with many stores inside.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Right.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,460
So it's like a shopping center.

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,480
And our last word for vocabulary preview is gang.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
The gang.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
The gang.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,240
Okay, so a gang is a group of people, right?

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,160
Yeah, it's a group of people.

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,000
You can call your friends the gang.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
We're going to go out with the gang tonight.

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Yep.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,080
And we sometimes hear this word and it has a negative meaning, right?

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,840
Right, like street gang.

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,320
Yeah, so people who fight and deal drugs and all that sort of stuff.

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Right.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,640
So it can have a negative and a positive meaning, but it just depends on how you use it.

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,400
Yeah, but in the dialogue we'll hear it with a positive meaning.

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Right.

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,800
So that's all the words we have for vocabulary preview.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,360
Let's listen to this cool and hip dialogue from the 1990s and we'll come back later and

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
explain some words.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,920
Hey, Four Eyes.

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,200
What's up, man?

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,360
How have you been?

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Not bad.

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:18,800
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Check out my new Adidas.

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,760
Those are dope.

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,360
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,040
Dude, don't even go there.

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,640
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,880
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
That's right.

56
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,280
You are such a player, man.

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
Dude, there's Mad Max.

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Let's go say hi.

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,440
Mad Max, what's up?

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,640
Are you okay?

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,600
You look like you just saw a ghost.

62
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,960
I got an F in English class.

63
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
My life is over.

64
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Dude, you're over it.

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,960
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,280
Come on, let's bounce.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Where are we going?

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,640
Oh, crap.

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,000
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,320
I'm going to open the can of whoop ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Okay, okay.

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Geez.

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:34,640
Well, it sounds like this guy's got some problems at school, huh?

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,080
Yeah, he got an F on his paper, but you always can count on your friends to try and cheer

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,480
you up by doing something.

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Yeah, but they use some really great phrases and vocabulary words, so why don't we look

77
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
at those now in Language Takeaway.

78
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,520
All right, on Language Takeaway we're going to be looking at five words and well, let's

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,400
start with the first one.

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,120
So the guy was talking about his really cool new shoes, his new Adidas, right?

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,960
And his friend said, those are dope.

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Dope.

84
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Dope.

85
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,600
Okay, so it's pretty easy to understand when something is dope.

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
It's really awesome.

87
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
It's cool.

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
It's great.

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Right, it's great.

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
So that's dope.

91
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,240
And it's an adjective, right?

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,880
So his friend said, those are dope.

93
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,480
And he said, you're going to be getting mad props from the gang.

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Okay, so mad props.

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,360
Mad props.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,020
We can divide this word in two.

97
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,120
So let's take a look at the first part, mad.

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,160
So we understand that mad is angry, right?

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
Yeah, but it can also mean a lot, right?

100
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Or like amazing.

101
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Or really.

102
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,520
So if I say, you have mad skills.

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,480
You're really good at something.

104
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Or you can say, she has a mad amount of shoes.

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
All right.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,320
So he's going to get mad props.

107
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
Now props is like respect or compliments.

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,640
Yeah.

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,220
So his shoes are so cool that he's going to get a lot of respect or a lot of compliments

110
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
from his friends.

111
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Exactly.

112
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
Mad props.

113
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,620
Mad props.

114
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,280
So they started talking about girls and he mentioned that this girl started tripping.

115
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Tripping.

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Tripping.

117
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,840
So to trip.

118
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Right.

119
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,880
As you notice, it's trippin'.

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,400
It doesn't have the G at the end, which isn't really grammatically correct, but that's kind

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,640
of the way it's pronounced.

122
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
Yeah.

123
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,440
We would never say the G. Right.

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,000
So if somebody is trippin'.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,300
They're getting really upset.

126
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,300
They're getting really angry.

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Right.

128
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,780
They're causing trouble.

129
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,640
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use trippin' for different

130
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,000
situations.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,760
Example one.

132
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,400
Leanne was trippin' because I got dirt on her car.

133
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,880
Example two.

134
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Even though I apologized for calling her fat, Jeannie was trippin' all night.

135
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,720
Example three.

136
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,540
He sent me 43 text messages and called me about 20 times.

137
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,240
That guy is trippin' over me.

138
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,440
Okay, so that's pretty clear.

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Trippin'.

140
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
All right.

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,120
Now, moving on to our next word.

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,640
They wanted to go somewhere and he said, come on, let's bounce.

143
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's bounce.

144
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Let's bounce.

145
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
I'm gonna bounce.

146
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,680
Now, bounce basically means let's leave.

147
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Yeah.

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Let's get out of here.

149
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,400
But we might be more familiar with this word as in like a ball, right?

150
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
A ball bounces off the floor.

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Exactly.

152
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,040
So I guess it's kind of the same.

153
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,800
You kind of bounce off the floor and leave that place.

154
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Yeah.

155
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Let's bounce.

156
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,320
Okay, so for our final word.

157
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,480
Now, this guy who got a bad mark on his paper, he was nervous about what his dad would say,

158
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
right?

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Right.

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
Because his dad was going to go postal.

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,920
He said, my dad is gonna go postal.

162
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
To go postal.

163
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,680
Now, if you go postal, it means you go crazy.

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,200
Yeah, you really freak out.

165
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
You get very angry.

166
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah, like really angry.

167
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,720
This word comes from the 90s because during a time, it was very common in the United States

168
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,400
that postal workers, mailmen, were going a little bit crazy and they started shooting

169
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,560
people and delivering some strange packages.

170
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Well, I guess so people who work in the post office maybe don't have the most exciting

171
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,320
jobs and that drives them a little crazy.

172
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Exactly.

173
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,360
But now they have a term named after them.

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
All right.

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time?

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,880
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back.

177
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,200
Hey, Four Eyes.

178
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
What's up, man?

179
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,560
How have you been?

180
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,960
Not bad.

181
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

182
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,240
Check out my new Adidas.

183
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
Those are dope.

184
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,360
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

185
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,320
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

186
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,080
Dude, don't even go there.

187
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,680
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

188
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,880
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

189
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
That's right.

190
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,360
You are such a player, man.

191
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,560
Dude, there's Mad Max.

192
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Let's go say hi.

193
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Max, what's up?

194
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,680
Are you okay?

195
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,640
You look like you just saw a ghost.

196
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,000
I got an F in English class.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My life is over.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Dude, you're over it.

199
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,520
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

200
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,840
Come on, let's bounce.

201
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Where are we going?

202
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,200
Oh, crap.

203
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,560
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

204
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm going to open a can of whoop-ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Okay, okay.

206
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Jeez.

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,440
Okay, so I think that was a little easier to understand.

208
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,000
You know, we've got a lot of pretty strange words and phrases, some interesting slang.

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,520
Yeah, and I want to take a look at this slang now, so let's get started with Fluency Builder.

210
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Fluency Builder.

211
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,080
Okay, so the guy with the new shoes, he asked his friends, have you seen Betty lately, right?

212
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Right.

213
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,680
And his friend replied, don't even go there.

214
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Right.

215
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,800
And he said, dude, don't even go there.

216
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Don't even go there.

217
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,520
So what does he mean when he says, don't even go there?

218
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,280
He means, don't talk about it.

219
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,720
I don't want to talk about it.

220
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Right.

221
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
Don't even touch that subject.

222
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Don't even mention it.

223
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Right.

224
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,640
So if somebody wants to talk about a topic that you think is sensitive or you don't want

225
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
to talk about, just say, hey, don't even go there.

226
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
So Marco, what do you think about the new tax law?

227
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Don't even go there.

228
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,280
I don't even want to talk about politics.

229
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Okay.

230
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,080
I think that's a really actually quite helpful phrase to avoid talking about an uncomfortable

231
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
subject.

232
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Right.

233
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,520
So he said, don't even go there.

234
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,920
And he started talking about the girl and she was tripping.

235
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,960
And then he said something interesting.

236
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,880
He said, I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

237
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah, I really like this phrase.

238
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
Now, I want to focus on the first part.

239
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,160
I was like.

240
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,400
I was like.

241
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I was like.

242
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,280
Now, you might hear a lot of native English speakers use these three words before they

243
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,960
start telling you what they said.

244
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,280
So it's like saying, I said or I told him.

245
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Yep.

246
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,080
So this actually is really common, especially with people under the age of 30.

247
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,480
So why don't we hear a few more examples of how it's used now.

248
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,000
Example one.

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,560
This guy caused a car accident.

250
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,240
I was like, you idiot.

251
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,400
You can kill people by driving like that.

252
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,960
Example two.

253
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,120
And then I was like, I hate you.

254
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,880
And she was all like, I hate you more.

255
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Example three.

256
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,840
I told the teacher that I didn't finish my homework and he was like, I'll see you after

257
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,360
school.

258
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,760
So if you're telling a story or you're maybe talking to somebody and you want to explain

259
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,440
what you said, you can say, I was like, hey, what are you doing?

260
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,760
And she was like, what?

261
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,960
So you can have an entire dialogue based with I was like, she was like, we were like.

262
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Okay.

263
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,680
So I was like, it's super, super useful.

264
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
So now our next word.

265
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,920
Now, they saw their friend who got the bad marking in school and the guy said, dude,

266
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,280
get over it.

267
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Get over it.

268
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,400
Get over it.

269
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,560
So if somebody tells you to get over it.

270
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,000
Stop worrying about it.

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
Or stop thinking about it.

273
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
All right.

274
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,640
So if somebody is sad because maybe his girlfriend broke up with him, you would say, get over

275
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
it.

276
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Stop thinking about it.

277
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Let it go.

278
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
It's in the past.

279
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Yeah.

280
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,960
And you commonly use this for when somebody is upset about a small thing, something they

281
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,760
shouldn't worry about.

282
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Get over it.

283
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Yep.

284
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Now, why don't we go on to our final word?

285
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,200
At the end of the dialogue, they said, I'm going to open a can of whoop ass.

286
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Okay.

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
So to open a can of whoop ass on somebody.

288
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,960
To open a can of whoop ass.

289
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,840
So again, let's break this down before we explain it.

290
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Okay.

291
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I think we have to take one step back here.

292
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,760
To whoop someone's ass is to beat them up, right?

293
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Right.

294
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
To punch them and hurt them.

295
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Right.

296
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
So to whoop somebody's ass.

297
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,800
So if I open a can of whoop ass, what does that mean?

298
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
It means you're going to beat them up.

299
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,480
So it's just a funny, very informal way of saying like, in this can, I'm going to open

300
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,520
it and I'm going to start hitting you or something like that.

301
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Some sort of small man is going to jump out of the can and start hitting you.

302
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Exactly.

303
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
But it's never literal.

304
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,860
It's not like you're actually going to beat somebody up.

305
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
It's just kind of like a joke.

306
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,860
Yeah.

307
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
It's an empty threat.

308
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Yeah.

309
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,860
All right.

310
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,120
So some really interesting words and phrases in this dialogue.

311
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,640
I think we should listen to it for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

312
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:18,640
bit more about this great decade.

313
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:31,360
Hey, Four Eyes.

314
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
What's up, man?

315
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,480
How have you been?

316
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,840
Not bad.

317
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,640
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

318
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,840
Check out my new Adidas.

319
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,360
Those are dope.

320
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,000
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

321
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,880
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

322
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,640
Dude, don't even go there.

323
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,240
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

324
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,440
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

325
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
That's right.

326
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,040
You are such a player, man.

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,120
Dude, there's Mad Max.

328
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,080
Let's go say hi.

329
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Max, what's up?

330
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
Are you okay?

331
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,200
You look like you just saw a ghost.

332
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,560
I got an F in English class.

333
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,960
My life is over.

334
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,480
Dude, you're over it.

335
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,600
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

336
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,880
Come on, let's bounce.

337
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Where are we going?

338
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Oh, crap.

339
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,600
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

340
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm going to open a can of whoop-ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay, okay.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Geez.

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:56,400
Well, Marco, in the dialogue, I heard one of the guys say, what's up?

344
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,000
But he said it in a really strange way, didn't he?

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, exactly.

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
He said, what's up?

347
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Okay.

348
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,680
So what's up with that?

349
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,520
So in the 90s, it was popular instead of saying what's up, you would just kind of double the

350
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
S and just say what's up.

351
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,640
And then it became very famous with a TV commercial for a certain beer.

352
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,200
And actually, I remember this commercial during the Super Bowl.

353
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,680
They had this big commercial where everyone was saying what's up in this really strange

354
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
way, right?

355
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,960
It's still used today informally between friends.

356
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
You'll go ahead, hey, what's up?

357
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
What's up?

358
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
Yeah, you'll use it.

359
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,040
Yeah, so that commercial made it actually quite cool and famous to talk like that.

360
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,880
Actually in SpanishPod, they have a show called Que Pasa, which is like the translation of

361
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
what's up.

362
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Oh, right.

363
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,640
They start each show with like saying, Que Pasa, but it's exactly the same.

364
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,480
So maybe it will become popular in Spanish.

365
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,600
Maybe but I guess only...

366
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Time will tell.

367
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Yeah, that's right.

368
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
All right.

369
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
So really cool stuff.

370
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,240
And as we heard typical music from the 90s.

371
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,160
And another interesting thing was the nicknames, Four Eyes, Mad Max, very popular among young

372
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
kids.

373
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,960

374
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,400
