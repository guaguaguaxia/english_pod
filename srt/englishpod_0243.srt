00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,480
And sometimes you're just tired of work, you're tired of everything, you want to go somewhere

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,720
for a nice romantic weekend, you take a holiday or a getaway.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
That's right.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,520
So why don't we take a look at this word on Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,840
Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,560
Okay, so Marco, the word I mentioned is getaway.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,460
It has a couple of different meanings in English.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,560
What are we talking about today?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,820
Well, to get away from someone would be to like leave, right, to try and stay far away.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,980
But a getaway, so taking it as a noun, a romantic getaway, is actually to take a holiday or

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,280
romantic escape from the city, escape from your daily normal life.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
That's right.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,240
So it's usually kind of brief or sudden, almost like you're just going to sneak out and then

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,080
come back in a couple of days.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Exactly.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,680
So many people refer to them as island getaways if you go to an island or a romantic getaway

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,480
if you have a romantic two-day vacation or something like this.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Right.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
And what are you getting away from?

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,920
You're getting away from work, you're getting away from the busyness of the city, you're

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
getting away from noise.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,960
It's a nice way to get into the countryside or as you said, the islands.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Exactly.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,800
So I think we can take a look at our dialogue.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,200
We actually were going to a travel agency called Getaway Tours and we're going to try

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:35,560
and see if we can book a nice romantic getaway.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,440
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,600
How can I help you?

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,160
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
Very well.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,320
We have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,840
or even going to a spa for the weekend.

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,720
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Perfect.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,760
This package includes round trip flights to New Hampshire.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,760
A free airport pickup is included.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,520
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,720
foods to soften this 30 minute ride to the countryside.

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,880
Sounds good.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,160
That is the best part.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,540
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to

46
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,700
accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,960
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,860
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,320
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,020
garden.

51
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,200
Or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
room or outside on our terrace.

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,560
Wow this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,040
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,220
Of course.

56
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,000
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
country trail.

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm sold.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I want to book this trip.

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,220
I don't care what it costs.

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,200
Money is no object.

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,800
Alright we're back.

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,720
So I think this sounds pretty romantic right?

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
It sounds too good to be true.

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
It's perfect.

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,520
They have butlers and food and horseback riding.

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
That's right.

69
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,980
So she actually mentioned a couple of interesting words there describing where they're going

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,820
to go or how they're going to spend their time.

71
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,920
So why don't we take a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,960
Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Okay so the first word has to do with where this couple is going.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,880
They're going to the countryside.

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,460
That's right the countryside.

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,280
So what exactly is the countryside?

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Well countryside or the country is the opposite of the city.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,740
So it's anywhere that is rural or less developed than a city.

79
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,720
Not big skyscrapers or businesses or big towns.

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,160
It's actually pretty quiet.

81
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,280
Okay so usually the countryside will have a lot of natural wildlife.

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,160
Trees, gardens or farms I think can be considered part of the countryside.

83
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,760
And so yeah that's basically the complete opposite from a city right?

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,740
Yes and that's why a lot of people take getaways to the countryside because it's as far away

85
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,880
from the city as you can go.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,680
Okay very good and to get to the countryside they're actually taking a round trip flight

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,320
to New Hampshire.

88
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,000
Alright so round trip is an important vocabulary item when we're talking about travel because

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,480
you can use this for train tickets, flight tickets, even boat tickets.

90
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,520
It means that you're going there and you're coming back.

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,240
It's basically two tickets.

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,560
Right so the opposite would be if you buy a one-way ticket or a one-way flight.

93
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,240
That's right so many people dream of buying a one-way ticket to the island.

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,400
They never have to come back but round trip means you're going to come home at some point.

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,240
So they're actually going round trip to New Hampshire and also they're getting picked

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,800
up at the airport where they're going to have a nice limo that's going to offer them complimentary

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,960
champagne and finger foods.

98
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Okay my favorite kind of champagne.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Complimentary.

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,240
That's right this means that they're not going to pay for it right?

101
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
It's free.

102
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,980
So the company is going to pay for it.

103
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,760
You can have complimentary food, you can have complimentary service.

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,480
These are basically things that someone else is providing for you.

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,520
You don't have to pay for them.

106
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,120
Even on talking about flights sometimes people will get a complimentary upgrade to first

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,520
class that means they are getting a better service for free.

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Not me.

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,160
Hey if you work for an airline I would love complimentary bump to first class.

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
And what about this finger foods?

111
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
What about that?

112
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
That sounds kind of strange.

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,280
Yeah it might sound disgusting but it's not actually fingers that you eat.

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,480
It's food that you can eat with your fingers.

115
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,240
So they're like small little treats or snacks that you can have.

116
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,440
Exactly usually if you go to a cocktail party or if you go to a party at a museum or an

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,200
event they'll have these little little foods that you can pick up and eat.

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,400
You don't need a fork or a spoon.

119
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,720
Okay so they're very small convenient little snacks that you can just kind of pick at and

120
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
pop into your mouth.

121
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,520
All right and all of this they're doing because they have a 30 minute ride to the countryside

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,160
so they want to soften the 30 minute ride.

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,080
Okay so to soften something means to make it more enjoyable or more pleasurable.

124
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Because oh no the 30 minute ride is so rough so hard.

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
And so boring.

126
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
So this makes it better.

127
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,440
Okay so yeah you can soften things such as the ride to the countryside or you can even

128
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,200
soften someone up so maybe give them some nice compliments so they'll be nice to you.

129
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
That's right to soften.

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,320
Okay all right so why don't we take a break and listen to the dialogue again and we'll

131
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,640
be back with language takeaway part two.

132
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,600
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
How can I help you?

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,360
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,520
Very well.

136
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,000
We have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,560
or even going to a spa for the weekend.

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,480
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

139
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Perfect.

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,520
This package includes round trip flights to New Hampshire.

141
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
A free airport pickup is included.

142
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,480
foods to soften this 30 minute ride to the countryside.

144
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,640
Sounds good.

145
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,080
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

146
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,920
That is the best part.

147
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,280
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to

148
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,440
accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

149
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,720
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Included in the price is three meals a day excluding beverages.

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,120
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green

152
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,640
gardens or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,440
in your room or outside on our terrace.

154
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,320
Wow, this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

155
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,760
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
Of course.

157
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,760
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
country trail.

159
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,360
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

160
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm sold.

161
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
I want to book this trip.

162
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't care what it costs.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Money is no object.

164
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,040
Alright, we're back and now we're going to take a look at a good group of adjectives

165
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,280
that the travel agent used to describe how great this hotel is, how great the place is.

166
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,760
Language takeaway.

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,880
Okay, so the person on the telephone representing the travel company is trying to sell something.

168
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,880
So she's using these really, really great adjectives to make everything sound awesome.

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,160
And one of the first things she says is that you will enjoy an intimate and private time

170
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
in this great hotel.

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,080
Okay, so an intimate time, if something is intimate, it means it's very, I don't know,

172
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,360
it usually means like romantic, right?

173
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,240
Romantic, cozy, but also private.

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,280
So something that is intimate is usually between two people.

175
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,400
Okay, so if they're going to have an intimate and private room, that means it's a room only

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
for them.

177
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Yes, or if someone has an intimate relationship, that means that they're romantically involved.

178
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,560
Okay, and the travel agent went on to describe how fabulous the restaurant is.

179
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,000
So this adjective is really nice, fabulous.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,440
I think you have to say it like that, fabulous.

181
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,160
So this means that it's just a wonderful restaurant.

182
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,680
And some people even say totally fab.

183
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,720
Okay.

184
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,320
Can you describe someone as fabulous?

185
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Not really, right?

186
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
He is so fabulous.

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
She is fabulous.

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Really?

189
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
You can say that?

190
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
My mom says it all the time.

191
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,160
Yeah, so it also depends on, I think, your personality.

192
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,760
This is a very, very descriptive word.

193
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,280
So sometimes it's a bit too strong.

194
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
You have to be careful.

195
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,480
But yeah, you can describe a person, you can describe a place, you can describe a thing

196
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
with the word fabulous.

197
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
All right.

198
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,520
Apart from having this fabulous restaurant, they also have a stunning view of the gardens.

199
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,840
All right, stunning is similar to the word breathtaking or shocking in a good way.

200
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,640
It makes you really, really impressed because it's so beautiful or so unique.

201
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:53,140
Okay, so for example, the views, the view of the beach is stunning, right?

202
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,560
Or even someone, you can say, wow, you look stunning.

203
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
That's right.

204
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,600
So this is a really great compliment, by the way.

205
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,520
Usually men say this to women.

206
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,020
Women don't say this to men.

207
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:09,320
You can describe someone's clothes as stunning, like her dress was stunning at the Oscars.

208
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,880
But if you're a man trying to give a woman a good compliment, believe me, this one works.

209
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,920
You look stunning this evening.

210
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,940
Okay, nice little tip there.

211
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,760
Using the adjective stunning.

212
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,780
Okay, now lush.

213
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,960
We have lush green gardens.

214
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,800
So we're looking, we have a stunning view of the lush green gardens.

215
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
This word lush.

216
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,920
Lush usually describes things that are organic, like plants and flowers.

217
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,880
And we say this to mean that something is very green, very healthy, very full.

218
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,400
Okay, so an apple tree, full with apples and you have a, it just looks great.

219
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,080
You would say it's a lush apple tree.

220
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,840
Right, or I could even say, I've heard that the rainforests of Ecuador are very, very

221
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
lush, very green.

222
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Yeah, exactly.

223
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,400
All right, so lush, they're very abundant, very green, very healthy.

224
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,840
And apart from these adjectives, the sales agent also described that the country villa

225
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,120
had recently been restored and refurbished.

226
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
So what about these two words, restored and refurbished?

227
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,360
Okay, basically what she's saying is that this house, this big villa, was recently completely

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,080
remade on the inside.

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,840
So the appearance, the look doesn't really change.

230
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,380
It's still an old, beautiful villa, but maybe the insides were old or needed to be updated.

231
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,320
And so that means that the plumbing, the lights, the walls, the paint, that was all restored,

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,960
maybe to look like the original, very, very beautiful and clean.

233
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,880
But also it was refurbished, which means that the fittings and the carpet and maybe the

234
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,600
lights and all the furniture, that was also new again.

235
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay, so we usually hear about this sometimes in the news when they are restoring an old

236
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,720
church or an old building.

237
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,160
That means they're making it, they're trying to save it and make it look like it used to.

238
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
They're not changing it, right?

239
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
They're not trying to make it look new, but they're trying to make it look like it used

240
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,240
to look before it got old.

241
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,800
You know how sometimes old things are worn and they're not pretty anymore?

242
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,140
Well, what they're trying to do is make it really shiny and beautiful.

243
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,040
And refurbish is basically to give it, as you said, new carpet or sometimes new furniture

244
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
or stuff like that.

245
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,520
So many people refurbish their homes, right?

246
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
That's right.

247
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,760
And it's a very, very popular thing to do with older houses.

248
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,960
You buy them, you fix them, you restore them, you refurbish them so that you want to live

249
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
in them.

250
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Right.

251
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Okay.

252
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
So a lot of great things from this dialogue.

253
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:48,040
I think we should listen to it one more time and we'll be back in a little bit.

254
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

255
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,080
How can I help you?

256
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,640
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

257
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
Very well.

258
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,040
We have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside,

259
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,280
or even going to a spa for the weekend.

260
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,200
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

261
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Perfect.

262
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,240
This package includes round trip flights to New Hampshire.

263
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,200
A free airport pickup is included.

264
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,920
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger

265
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,160
foods to soften the 30 minute ride to the countryside.

266
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Sounds good.

267
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,760
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

268
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,600
That is the best part.

269
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,960
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to

270
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,120
accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

271
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,400
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

272
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,280
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

273
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,880
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green

274
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,440
gardens.

275
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
Or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your

276
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,120
room or outside on our terrace.

277
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,000
Wow, this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,480
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

279
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,640
Of course.

280
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,440
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the

281
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,040
country trail.

282
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,040
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

283
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
I'm sold.

284
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I want to book this trip.

285
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,680
I don't care what it costs.

286
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:27,640
Money is no object.

287
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,240
All right, so talking about getaways.

288
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,500
Now the sales agent offered him options such as beach, wilderness, countryside, or even

289
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,560
a spa.

290
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Which one do you prefer?

291
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Wilderness.

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
For sure.

293
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,280
You want to go into the forest, the jungle.

294
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,920
Yes, I hate to say it.

295
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,880
I think beaches are boring.

296
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,480
Sorry, mom.

297
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,720
I know you love beaches.

298
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,960
I like to do stuff when I'm away.

299
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,800
I love the desert too, but the wilderness, somewhere where I'm outside.

300
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,960
I live in a city.

301
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I don't want to go to a city.

302
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,160
I like to go somewhere where I can walk around, hike, ride a bike, do things like that.

303
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
What about you?

304
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,840
I actually don't have a favorite, actually.

305
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,920
Sometimes it's nice for me to go to the beach and relax.

306
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,520
I do tend to get a little bit bored after maybe two days of doing nothing on the beach.

307
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,720
But it does give a good opportunity to do other things, beach activities like snorkeling

308
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,160
or scuba diving, which can also be really fun.

309
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,560
But definitely I do enjoy the wilderness as well, the jungle and rafting or camping.

310
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,960
It's good fun.

311
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,000
The insects can be a bit of a nuisance at times.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Or the rain.

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Or the rain.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Getting in the snow or the rain is so horrible.

315
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,880
But other than that, yeah, it's great.

316
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,000
I know not many people enjoy these types of outdoor getaways.

317
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,880
But of course, you have spas.

318
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,840
I know many people enjoy going to a spa, having a mud bath.

319
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,400
Nothing wrong with that.

320
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,920
Getting your nails done, having a massage.

321
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,080
Getting the whole royal treatment, like we say.

322
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,040
So this is what we want to know now.

323
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,840
When you go on vacation, what do you like to do?

324
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,160
Do you like to get away to the tropical beaches?

325
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,120
Do you like to go to the islands or the jungle?

326
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
What do you like to do?

327
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Let us know.

328
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,520
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

329
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
We hope to see you there.

330
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
All right.

331
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
We'll see you guys next time.

332
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Bye.
