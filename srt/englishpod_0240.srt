00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,760
My name is Catherine and today we're talking all about animals.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
That's right.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,960
This is a very interesting topic, very important because a lot of people like to have pets.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
That's right.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
We're not going to the zoo.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,080
We're not talking about animals out in the forest or in nature.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,000
We're talking about pets that you keep at home.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,800
So let's start right away with today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,480
what's going on.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,360
We have been over this a hundred times.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,480
We are not getting a pet.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Why not?

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Come on.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,520
Just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,760
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
I will.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,360
I'll feed it, bathe it, and walk it every day.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,160
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,920
What if we want to take a vacation?

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,480
Who will we leave it with?

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,080
Our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Okay.

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,120
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,240
We're planning on having children soon.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
Fine.

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,480
Let's get a bird then.

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,880
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,800
A parrot would be awesome.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I'll tell you what.

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,960
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,800
Yay!

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Alright we're back.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,480
So obviously pets, having a pet at home is a very big responsibility and well this is

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,080
what the couple was talking about.

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,240
But before we get into that discussion, why don't we take a look at five key words that

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,440
we have picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,040
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,760
So first off the couple is talking about whether they should get a dog or a cat or puppy or

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,800
kitty and when they start talking about dogs, they talk about what kinds of dogs or the

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
breed of the dogs.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Let's look at this word.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
That's right.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,000
They were talking about a German Shepherd or a Labrador and as you said this is the

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,440
breed or maybe you can say a kind of dog.

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
That's right.

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,960
So breed is the technical word to describe the kind of dog that something is.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,040
So like you said these are two examples.

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,280
There are many, many, many breeds that we can talk about but we'll just leave it at

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
this for now.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,760
But we talked about some other kinds of animals today.

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
But we heard about some other kinds of animals today.

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,620
Not dogs, not cats, maybe smaller animals.

56
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,620
That's right.

57
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,200
One of the animals that the person mentioned was a ferret.

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,780
Oh a ferret.

59
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,520
So this is a very small, kind of long animal.

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
That's right.

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
You may have seen it, pets before.

62
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,560
They kind of look like, I don't know, kind of they have the face of a rat maybe but they're

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
very long.

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
And they're thin.

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
They're very thin.

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,040
They're not like a rat because maybe their body shape is very, very different.

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,760
But they're also kind of small and they like to eat those little insects.

68
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah.

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
I don't know if they have long tails like rats do.

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I think they have furry tails.

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I don't think their tails are different.

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah.

73
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
So that's a ferret.

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
But we also heard about a special kind of bird.

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
That's right.

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,440
We talked about a parrot.

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,560
So as you know, there are many different kinds of birds.

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,760
You can see birds at your window all the time.

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,200
But birds that come from tropical places, usually very, very colorful birds are called

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,360
parrots.

81
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
That's right.

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,220
So a parrot usually can talk or imitate what you say or sounds, right?

83
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
That's right.

84
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,820
They're actually very famous in the bird world for having a good ability to reproduce or

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,360
to mimic the sounds that you make.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
So if I say, hello, my parrot says, hello.

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Yeah, exactly.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,560
It's really strange.

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
They're very, very intelligent animals.

90
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
So that's a parrot.

91
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,660
And our last animal is a very small animal, very popular also to have as a pet.

92
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,600
We talked about a hamster.

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
A hamster.

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,040
So this is a little bit like a mouse.

95
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
They're furry.

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
They're small.

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
They're round.

98
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,160
And they live in glass cages or fish tanks, usually.

99
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Yeah.

100
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
They're very small.

101
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
They don't really do much.

102
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,640
They're just little furry creatures and they, I don't know, they just eat all day.

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,800
Sometimes they get those little wheels that they can get inside and run around all day.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
That's right.

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Or when I was a child and we had a hamster, we had a special plastic ball.

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,920
And you put the hamster in the ball and he would go around the house.

107
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Yeah, exactly.

108
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
It's very fun.

109
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
All right.

110
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,920
So we took a look at the pets that you can buy, domestic animals.

111
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,200
But taking a look at something very specific, when they were describing the responsibilities

112
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,120
of having maybe a dog or a cat, they said they have to feed it, bathe it, walk it.

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,200
So obviously we know that feed it is to give it food.

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,800
But what about bathe it?

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay.

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,280
So you might know the word bath.

117
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Okay.

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
That's a thing.

119
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
It's a noun.

120
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
Bathe is a verb.

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
To bathe.

122
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
And so I can bathe myself.

123
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,320
That means I take a shower.

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
I clean my body.

125
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,240
Or I can bathe something else, like an animal.

126
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
So bathing a dog means basically washing a dog.

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Right.

128
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,720
So it sounds very fancy or formal if you say, I'm going to go take a shower.

129
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
Or you say, I'm going to go bathe.

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Yeah.

131
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
We don't really say that as much.

132
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,640
But we often say bathe when we're talking about cleaning other things.

133
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,280
Not a table, but cleaning people or animals.

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Right.

135
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,880
So you can say, did you bathe the baby?

136
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Or did you bathe the dog?

137
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Okay.

138
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Yeah.

139
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,160
And also remember that even though the dog may be female or male, we don't give it gender.

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Right?

141
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,640
We describe it as it.

142
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
That's right.

143
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,880
Animals are almost always considered it in English.

144
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Although some people who really love their animals call it he or she.

145
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Right.

146
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Right.

147
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
So it's kind of your decision.

148
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,840
It's not really incorrect if you say, oh, my dog, she's so beautiful, if it's a female.

149
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,440
But technically, you should say, my dog, it's very beautiful.

150
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
Yeah.

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Okay.

152
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,720
So we've taken a look at a lot of words there.

153
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,880
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

154
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,760
We have been over this a hundred times.

155
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440
We are not getting a pet.

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Why not?

157
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Come on.

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,920
Just a cute little puppy or kitty.

159
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,160
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
I will.

161
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,720
I'll feed it, bathe it, and walk it every day.

162
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,560
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

163
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,280
What if we want to take a vacation?

164
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
Who will we leave it with?

165
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

166
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,720
Okay.

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,560
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,640
We're planning on having children soon.

169
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,400
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

170
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,640
Fine.

171
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
Let's get a bird then.

172
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,320
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

173
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,200
A parrot would be awesome.

174
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I'll tell you what.

175
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,640
I can get you some hamsters, and we'll take it from there.

176
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,080
Yay!

177
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,700
All right.

178
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
We're back.

179
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,480
We've picked out four key phrases for you.

180
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,640
Let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

181
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Fluency Builder.

182
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,360
So at the very beginning of today's conversation, we hear the first person say, we've been over

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,200
this a hundred times.

184
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,840
So what does this mean?

185
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,960
This means that they've never talked about this before?

186
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,840
No, this is actually the opposite, but it's a way to exaggerate, right?

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,800
Because obviously they haven't maybe talked about getting a pet a hundred times, but you're

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,160
just making emphasis on the fact that we've talked about this many, many, many times.

189
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,200
And almost like you're tired of it.

190
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,560
Like, oh, do we have to talk about this again?

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
It's like you said, an exaggeration to say, come on.

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,160
So we've been over this a million times.

193
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,560
We've been over this a hundred times.

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,640
These are all ways of saying, oh, we have to talk about this again?

195
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Exactly.

196
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,440
So you're emphasizing that, well, maybe you've done it too many times already.

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
All right.

198
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,440
And well, when they were talking about the puppy or the kitty, the guy asked, well, who's

199
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,280
going to look after the dog or the cat?

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Okay.

201
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,560
So this is an important phrase.

202
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,520
We're going to treat this as a kind of a chunk.

203
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,100
These words go together, to look after.

204
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,880
So we could look after a baby or look after the pet.

205
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,360
This means to watch or to care for.

206
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Right.

207
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
To take care.

208
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,600
So maybe if you're going to go out tonight, you want to leave your son with a babysitter

209
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,080
to look after him.

210
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Right.

211
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,280
To make sure that there are no problems or to make sure that he eats and goes to sleep.

212
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Exactly.

213
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,200
So to look after, to take care or to make sure he or she is okay.

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
All right.

215
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,280
And well, obviously the guy didn't want a puppy.

216
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,520
He didn't want a kitty.

217
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,200
So the girl was giving alternatives and said, well, how about we get a cat or a ferret?

218
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Okay.

219
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
The phrase here, how about, is very, very common in English.

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,440
I think a lot of people who learn English have a hard time knowing when to use this

221
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
phrase.

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
How about?

223
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,960
That's right.

224
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,280
So it's very simple.

225
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,520
The phrase how about is to give an alternative.

226
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Right.

227
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Okay.

228
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Or a suggestion.

229
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,040
So for example, you and I are talking about where to eat lunch.

230
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I don't know.

231
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
And you give a suggestion.

232
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
You say, how about pizza?

233
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,420
And I say, I don't know.

234
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,160
How about McDonald's?

235
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,120
We're giving suggestions or offering alternatives.

236
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Exactly.

237
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,440
So this is the correct way of using how about.

238
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,760
Many students make the mistake of using it as to say, how was it?

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,400
Or how did it go?

240
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Right?

241
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Right.

242
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
So how was your weekend?

243
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
That's correct.

244
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,160
How about your weekend?

245
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
That's incorrect.

246
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
No, do not say that.

247
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,280
You want to say, how about this?

248
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
How about that?

249
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
How about a Coke?

250
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,920
How about some food?

251
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,680
These are suggestions, but a real question you have to say how was or how is.

252
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Right.

253
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,280
So never, never, never say, how about your weekend?

254
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,360
That is incorrect.

255
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,720
And it's actually very common to hear this from students.

256
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,840
So remember, it's not correct.

257
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
How about your weekend?

258
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
No, incorrect.

259
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,560
So at the very end of the dialogue, we're talking about hamsters.

260
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,360
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

261
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
That's right.

262
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,100
The phrase take it from there.

263
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,640
It's kind of a way of saying, look, let's start with something small or let's start

264
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,580
with something simple and we will see how it goes.

265
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,720
So basically the woman is saying, I don't want to commit.

266
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,420
I don't want to agree to get a big animal like a dog or a cat because I'm not sure how

267
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
it will be.

268
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,280
I'm not sure if it will be too much responsibility.

269
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,960
So she's saying, okay, we'll get something small and then we'll wait and we'll see what

270
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
happens.

271
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
We'll take it from there.

272
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
That's right.

273
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,880
So it's basically saying, let's start slowly.

274
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,440
So for example, maybe a guy asks you out and says, hey, will you marry me?

275
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
And you say, whoa.

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,960
Let's go on a date first and we'll take it from there.

277
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Exactly.

278
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
We'll see what happens.

279
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,460
So let's start slowly.

280
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,760
Let's take things step by step.

281
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
All right.

282
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,080
So that's all the phrases that we have for you today.

283
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,960
I think we should listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little

284
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,400
bit more.

285
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
We've been over this a hundred times.

286
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,320
We are not getting a pet.

287
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Why not?

288
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Come on.

289
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,360
Just a cute little puppy or kitty.

290
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,640
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

291
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I will.

292
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,200
I'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day.

293
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,000
We can get a Labrador or a German shepherd.

294
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,760
What if we want to take a vacation?

295
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,280
Who will we leave it with?

296
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,040
Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

297
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Okay.

298
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,120
We're planning on having children soon.

300
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,760
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

301
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Fine.

302
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
Let's get a bird then.

303
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,760
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

304
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,680
A parrot would be awesome.

305
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I'll tell you what.

306
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,760
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

307
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Yay!

308
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,280
Alright Catherine, so what about pets?

309
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Are you a big pet lover?

310
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,680
Do you like ferrets, hamsters, all this good stuff?

311
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,400
I don't like small pets.

312
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
I love big pets.

313
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,160
So as a kid we had both.

314
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,720
My brother really loved small animals like hamsters and ferrets and things like that.

315
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,120
I just think they're a little bit stinky.

316
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,280
They kind of smell funny.

317
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,360
So ever since, I've always really liked big animals like dogs.

318
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,440
So you are a dog person.

319
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I am a dog person.

320
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,240
This is something interesting that we describe in English.

321
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,920
People say I am a dog person.

322
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,520
I am a cat person.

323
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,120
It's almost like it says something about your personality.

324
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Exactly.

325
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,600
So if you're a dog person, it means that you prefer dogs or you like dogs.

326
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
If you're a cat person, you prefer cats.

327
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,400
And a lot of people really like dogs but don't really like cats or they love cats and they

328
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,920
can't stand dogs.

329
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Right.

330
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,680
And it even gets to the point where I've heard that maybe on dates people will ask, so are

331
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,480
you a dog person or a cat person?

332
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,720
I know that's how I pick dates.

333
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Really?

334
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
What about you?

335
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Are you a dog person or a cat person?

336
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm definitely a dog person.

337
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Good answer.

338
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Yeah.

339
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,200
I think cats are, I mean they're nice and they're cuddly and I think they're very good

340
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,200
indoor pets and a little bit more fun than maybe a hamster.

341
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
But I think dogs have more life and are more energetic.

342
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,700
I think cats are very lazy.

343
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,800
And I think sometimes cats like to play mind games.

344
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,000
Like they're so smart that they can control you.

345
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That makes me uncomfortable.

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
All right.

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
So, well, there are a lot of other pets out there.

348
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,880
Some people have tarantula, some people have iguanas, other people have fish.

349
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Or horses.

350
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Horses.

351
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,560
If you have enough space, right?

352
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,800
So we want to know what kind of pets do you have or did you have as a kid?

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
That's right.

354
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Let us know.

355
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
