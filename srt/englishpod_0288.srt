00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,840
My name is Katherine and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
That's right.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,640
Today, we are getting a tattoo.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,740
Okay, so a tattoo is a picture that you get on your body and it lasts forever.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,740
That's right.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,180
So we're going to get a tattoo.

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,840
We're going to talk about this very popular form of art on your skin.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,960
And so let's start with the dialogue.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,120
Let's listen to it and we'll be back in a bit.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,460
I have made up my mind.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm getting a tattoo.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Really?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Are you sure?

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Yeah, why not?

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,320
They're trendy and look great.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,960
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,080
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,560
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,760
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Really?

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
Of course.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,480
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,240
Oh, I didn't know that.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,300
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,160
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,040
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you sterilize needles

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,500
and the place is hygienic.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,840
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Ew.

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,280
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,640
So now, let's take a look at five key words that we've picked out for you on Language

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,760
Takeaway.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,720
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,160
So the first phrase that we have here on Language Takeaway is indelible ink.

37
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
That's right.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,360
When you get a tattoo, they draw it on your skin with indelible ink.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,920
Okay, well, ink is what you find in a pen.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,400
So when you write, you write with ink.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,780
And this is something that you can also paint with.

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,600
But in this case, we're talking about indelible ink.

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
So that means it's going to be permanent in your skin.

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,880
So something that is indelible means that you cannot delete or erase.

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
That's right.

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
You can't take it away.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,240
Okay, indelible ink.

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,400
Or sometimes people just say permanent ink.

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
That's right.

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Okay.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,120
So obviously, if you get a tattoo with indelible ink, if you want to get it removed, now you

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,000
can with laser treatment.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,640
Okay, so laser treatment uses this very strong light to burn the ink out of your skin.

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,480
And it is something that you actually have to go and do many, many times to get the tattoo

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,240
removed.

56
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
I've also heard that it's very painful.

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Yeah, I've heard that.

58
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,560
It hurts a lot, more than getting the tattoo.

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Right.

60
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,480
So laser removal or laser treatment is something that you do when you want to take a tattoo

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
off your body.

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I think they also use laser treatment to remove, maybe you have stains on your skin, like from

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,600
the sun, or even to remove hair, I heard.

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Yeah, laser hair removal is something that many people do to take away some of the hair

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
on their bodies that they don't like.

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Okay.

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,040
So obviously, because tattoos are forever, this friend is asking this other person to

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,920
reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,800
Well, to consider something means to think about it.

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,520
So to reconsider means to think about it again.

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Right.

72
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,480
So if you're going to make a big decision, you should reconsider what you're going to

73
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
do.

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,520
For example, I really want to have a hamburger for dinner, but maybe I should reconsider

75
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
because hamburgers aren't very healthy.

76
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,480
Maybe I should decide on a salad or something.

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Very good.

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Okay.

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
So to reconsider.

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,520
Now, obviously, when we have a tattoo done, when we get a tattoo, they use this little

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,680
machine that has a needle inside and it vibrates very, very fast and it kind of injects the

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
ink.

83
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,560
So the friend tells this person to make sure that when they use this machine, they use

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
sterilized needles.

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Okay.

86
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,280
So needles are those very small little things that go into your skin.

87
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,720
They hurt.

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,200
When you get a shot, the doctor will use a needle as well.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,680
But a sterilized needle is a needle that is clean.

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,000
So something that is sterilized means clean.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's right.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
But it's clean for medical use.

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,120
That means that maybe someone used alcohol or even fire to clean something.

94
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Okay.

95
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,040
So as you said, it needs to go through a process to be sterilized.

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,480
Like if you wash your dishes, they're not sterilized.

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
No.

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,800
But if you are getting surgery on your body, the doctor is going to cut you open.

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,160
He will use sterilized tools.

100
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Okay.

101
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Very good.

102
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,440
And moving on to our last word, very much related to sterilized needles.

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,000
We're talking about something that is hygienic, to make sure that everything is hygienic when

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
you get a tattoo done.

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Okay.

106
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,340
Well, something that is hygienic is clean.

107
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,280
So if you have a baby, you want to make sure that the room that the baby is in is very

108
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
hygienic.

109
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,840
So you clean it very often.

110
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,480
Maybe you use some sterilizer to clean the different surfaces and things like that, because

111
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,200
babies can get sick easily.

112
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
That's right.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Okay.

114
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Very good.

115
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
So we've taken a look at five key words there.

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,840
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

117
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:39,280
We can review what we've just learned and we'll be back in a little bit with Fluency Builder.

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,640
I have made up my mind.

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm getting a tattoo.

120
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Really?

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Are you sure?

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Yeah.

123
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Why not?

124
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,480
They're trendy and look great.

125
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,120
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

126
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,720
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

128
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,920
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Really?

130
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Of course.

131
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,640
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

132
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Oh, I didn't know that.

133
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,480
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,320
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,200
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you sterilize needles

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,680
and the place is hygienic.

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

138
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Ew.

139
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,240
All right, we're back.

140
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,120
So now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,920
We only have three phrases today, but the first one is a phrase you'll hear very, very

142
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
often in English.

143
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,200
It's I've made up my mind.

144
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
That's right.

145
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,840
The dialogue starts by saying I've made up my mind.

146
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,880
I am getting a tattoo.

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,640
So what does it mean if you have made up your mind?

148
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Well, it means that you have decided something.

149
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
I have decided to do something.

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,120
And the present tense of this phrase is to make up someone's mind.

151
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,760
So I make up my mind, you make up your mind, he makes up his mind.

152
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,360
Okay, so if you're choosing something or making a decision, when you finally make that decision,

153
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,280
that means that you have made up your mind.

154
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,800
Maybe we're shopping, Marco, and you're thinking, well, do I want this or do I want that?

155
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,320
Well, I'll say, come on, Marco, make up your mind.

156
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
That's right.

157
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
It means just pick one.

158
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Just decide.

159
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Decide.

160
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Very good.

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,720
That's a very common phrase to make up your mind, to make a decision.

162
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,040
And well, as we continued on with the dialogue, the friend was saying how the tattoos are

163
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,480
forever and if you want to get it removed, you need to use laser treatment and ends this

164
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,920
part by saying on top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot.

165
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,380
On top of all that.

166
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,540
This means and even more.

167
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,120
So basically when you're trying to give reasons for something, maybe reasons for doing something

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,960
or reasons for not doing something, you give your reasons and at the end you say and on

169
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
top of all that.

170
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,880
So in addition or even more than that, this is the case.

171
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Right.

172
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,120
So maybe we're talking about a car and you say, well, that car is not very reliable.

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,180
It uses a lot of fuel.

174
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,080
It's very uncomfortable inside.

175
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,600
And on top of that, it's expensive.

176
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
And on top of all that, it's ugly.

177
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
That's right.

178
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,000
So you're kind of listing things and you're telling the person why you think something

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,880
is good or bad and then you end it by giving a final reason.

180
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
And on top of that.

181
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Exactly.

182
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
All right.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,200
And our last phrase, it's actually interesting because the place where you go and get a tattoo

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,280
is called a tattoo parlor.

185
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Okay.

186
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
It's a parlor.

187
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,040
Now, this is interesting because you might think that you would say a tattoo shop, but

188
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
we don't say this.

189
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,800
So think about a beauty salon or beauty parlor.

190
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,320
A parlor is a shop where we get our appearance changed.

191
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,420
In this case, a tattoo parlor is a special shop where you can get a tattoo or in the

192
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,920
case of this person, maybe get your ears pierced or your tongue pierced or your nose pierced.

193
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,160
So a tattoo parlor is a place to go for that.

194
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
All right.

195
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,520
So a lot of phrases there.

196
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:31,880
Let's review everything one last time and we'll be back to talk some more.

197
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,240
I have made up my mind.

198
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,640
I'm getting a tattoo.

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Really?

200
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Are you sure?

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Yeah.

202
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Why not?

203
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
They're trendy and look great.

204
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,760
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

205
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,840
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

206
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,320
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,520
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

208
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Really?

209
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Of course.

210
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,160
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,040
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

213
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,920
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

214
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,800
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you sterilize needles

215
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,260
and the place is hygienic.

216
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,000
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,160
Ew.

218
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,680
So talking about tattoos and also piercings, a very popular thing nowadays, especially

219
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,760
we didn't touch on the piercing aspect of the dialogue, to get your ears pierced or

220
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,440
to get your tongue pierced means that you're going to create a hole in your tongue so you

221
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,640
can put a ring or something in it.

222
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
That's right.

223
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,920
So many women have their ears pierced.

224
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,360
This means that they can wear earrings and these are small holes in the bottom of your

225
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
ear.

226
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
But a lot of people nowadays like to get their nose pierced, so a hole in the side of the

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
nose or their tongues pierced.

228
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
That's right.

229
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,800
You see people now get eyebrows pierced, their lips pierced, even below the lip, like I don't

230
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,320
know, near the chin, between the chin and the lip, they get this thing through it.

231
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
It's very interesting.

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

233
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
Also, I've seen belly buttons.

234
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Belly buttons get pierced.

235
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Like on your stomach.

236
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
That's right.

237
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
And tattoos as well.

238
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,720
Tattoos are so popular now.

239
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,040
People get tattoos, arms, legs, your neck, face, everywhere now.

240
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
That's right.

241
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
And there are special names for these in English.

242
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,640
For example, if you have a very big tattoo in your arm from your shoulder to your elbow,

243
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,960
that's called a sleeve tattoo because it looks like a permanent sleeve.

244
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
That's right.

245
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,520
And actually, women get tattoos also, but for cosmetic reasons.

246
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,960
Many women get their eyebrows tattooed.

247
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,520
Yeah, I've seen this.

248
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,600
So, some women like to get these tattoos that look like makeup.

249
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,040
So maybe if you want your nice eyebrows all the time, you get these eyebrow tattoos or

250
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,440
if you want some dark lines under your eyes, like eyeliner, then you get the eyeliner tattoo.

251
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,880
Also, I've seen the lips, lip liner tattoo.

252
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,360
They do it around the lips to make it seem like you consistently have lip liner.

253
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Interesting.

254
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Well, I don't know if I do that because some days you just don't want to wear makeup.

255
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
That's right.

256
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,280
But actually, tattoos in many cultures are frowned upon.

257
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,400
I know that until very recently in Japanese culture, tattoos were illegal because they

258
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
were sent to the Yakuza.

259
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,080
And in Jewish culture, you're not allowed to have a tattoo on your body.

260
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,640
And so, if you die with a tattoo, you cannot go to a Jewish graveyard.

261
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Oh, really?

262
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,320
I've also heard that in many countries, some positions, some job positions, you cannot

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,360
obtain if you have a tattoo.

264
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Wow, Saul.

265
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
It's very interesting.

266
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
I don't know why that would influence it.

267
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,400
I think it's definitely culture to culture because it's very popular in America right

268
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
now to have tattoos.

269
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,760
But in China and Japan and East Asia, they're definitely frowned upon.

270
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,920
Even for example, in the armed forces in the United States, it's very popular for them

271
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,660
to have an American flag or something.

272
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,480
You see it all the time in movies.

273
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,680
But in other countries, you cannot join the armed forces if you have a tattoo.

274
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Interesting.

275
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Well, let us know.

276
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,040
Is having a tattoo okay in your culture or do people tend to think that it's a bad thing?

277
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
Or maybe you have a tattoo.

278
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,200
Do you have a tattoo or a piercing in your nose or your lip or your tongue?

279
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Let us know.

280
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,460
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

281
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
We hope to see you there.

282
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
All right.

283
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,460
Bye, guys.

284
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,000
Thanks a lot.
