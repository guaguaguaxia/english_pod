00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,760
Katrina And my name is Katrin.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,400
And today we're talking about one of my least favorite things, Marco.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,800
Marco Mosquitoes.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,800
They're all over the place, especially in summer or near water.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
And for me, the worst part is when you are trying to sleep and there's a mosquito that

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,800
just keeps on biting you and won't let you sleep.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Katrina You can kind of hear it around your head, you

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
know, by your ears.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Marco Yeah, around your ear, uh-huh.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Katrina Oh, I hate that.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Or when you just get bitten and you're in bed and it just itches so much you can't sleep.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Marco Itches, and it burns sometimes.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Katrina Yeah, so that's what we're talking about

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,880
today, fun stuff.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,800
Let's jump right into this dialogue, and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what's going

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
on.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
The mosquitoes are biting me!

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Me too!

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
I can't stop scratching!

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks!

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm going to get you!

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm going to get you!

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm going to get you!

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm going to get you!

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm going to get you!

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm going to get you!

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm going to get you!

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm going to get you!

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm going to get you!

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,340
I'm going to get you!

33
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm going to get you!

34
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to get you!

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Katrina No, I forgot to buy some.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
Marco Then we'll have to put up with it.

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,340
Katrina We can cover ourselves with beer.

38
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,580
That way, if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

39
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,260
Marco That's, without doubt, the best idea you've

40
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
ever had.

41
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,140
Let's do it.

42
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,280
Katrina Run!

43
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,640
They're thirsty for more!

44
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:37,200
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at some of these words in Language Takeaway.

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,520
Language Takeaway.

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,900
All right, so as we mentioned, we're going to be talking about mosquitoes and well, these

47
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,660
are just little small insects that suck your blood.

48
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,140
They do and they're very thin and not much to say about them.

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,880
They were very important in the movie Jurassic Park if you remember that.

50
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Right.

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,840
Now, what's the difference between a mosquito and a fly?

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Okay, a fly usually is just annoying.

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
It doesn't suck your blood, but a mosquito does.

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,360
It sucks your blood and flies are fatter and like shorter.

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,400
And they're big and black and they're black.

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
And they're green kind of sometimes.

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
Black and green and they, yeah, they just buzz around.

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
So mosquitoes actually bite you.

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay, so a mosquito and a fly.

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,640
Now, if a mosquito bites you, you really, really want to scratch.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
That's right.

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,160
So you feel like you need to scratch your body because you have this bite.

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,880
You know, it's really an allergy and you have a red bump on your arm, a red mark and you

64
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
scratch and it gets worse and worse.

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
All right.

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,200
And moving on to our next word, mosquitoes have a reputation of being sneaky.

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,440
Okay, so you can say sneaky about a lot of things.

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,080
And, you know, obviously we're saying mosquitoes are very sneaky.

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,280
That means that they can kind of hide and get you when you're not expecting it.

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah, because sometimes during the day, you don't really see them in your room, right?

71
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,680
They're hiding or they're in a place where you can't really see them.

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,560
And then at night, all of a sudden, they come out.

73
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
They come out.

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
So, and they're very hard to see.

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,280
They fly around in a way that's very difficult to catch them or kill them, right?

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Right.

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
We could say thieves are very sneaky.

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,040
Like a thief is someone who steals something and they like to sneak around and hide in

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
the dark.

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,880
And then when you're not expecting it, they come out and they steal your stuff.

81
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Exactly.

82
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,920
And now what do we do or what do we use in order to prevent mosquitoes from biting us?

83
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,360
This is essential, especially if you're going to the beach.

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,880
We bring bug spray.

85
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Bug spray.

86
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,960
So a spray is something that you can usually have in a can that you push a button and it

87
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
comes out.

88
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
All right.

89
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Right.

90
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,800
And it's not water, but it keeps the bugs away.

91
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
So bug spray keeps bugs away.

92
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,640
Not only mosquitoes, but like flies or any other type of bug.

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,080
Now specifically for mosquitoes, you would use maybe a mosquito repellent.

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Right.

95
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,720
So repellent is, it means something that pushes or keeps away things you don't want.

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,240
So something that keeps mosquitoes away is called a mosquito repellent.

97
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,080
And usually it's a cream you put on your arms or legs.

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
All right.

99
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Very good.

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,200
So interesting words that we've just taken a look at.

101
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,800
Let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be right back.

102
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,120
The mosquitoes are biting me.

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Me too.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
I can't stop scratching.

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,600
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks.

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,160
Do you have any bug spray?

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,680
No, I forgot to buy some.

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,800
Then we'll have to put up with it.

109
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,960
We can cover ourselves with beer.

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,760
That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,920
That's without doubt the best idea you've ever had.

112
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Let's do it.

113
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Run.

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
They're thirsty for more.

115
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,760
All right, we're back.

116
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,800
So now let's take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Fluency Builder.

118
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
All right.

119
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,200
So the first phrase is very, very common.

120
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,240
The person in the dialogue says that they're going to have to put up with it, put up with

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,560
these mosquitoes because they didn't have any bug spray.

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
So this phrase, to put up with, is really important.

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
All right.

124
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,920
So if you put up with something, it means that you tolerate it.

125
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
All right.

126
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,920
That means even if you don't want to, you'll still handle it.

127
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,000
You'll still have to deal with it.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,280
You accept it.

129
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,480
So maybe you have a little brother that's very annoying and you just have to put up

130
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
with him.

131
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
There's no other option.

132
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Yeah.

133
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,040
Or someone says to you, you're just going to have to put up with it.

134
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,800
Or you say, I won't put up with it anymore.

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
I won't handle this anymore.

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm done.

137
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
All right.

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,920
So I think this is a great phrase for us to take a look at a couple of different examples.

139
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Example one.

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,320
I can't put up with the noise any longer.

141
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,360
Turn that music down.

142
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,400
Example two.

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,000
If you can put up with the smell, then stinky tofu is actually very tasty.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Example three.

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
I've had to put up with him for too long.

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,440
I want a new roommate.

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
And after this, we've got another phrase.

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
We're talking about beer.

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Okay.

150
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
And so the person says, oh, I have an idea.

151
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,060
Instead of bug spray, we can cover ourselves with beer.

152
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,680
So to cover yourself or cover ourselves.

153
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,400
So it means that we put it all over us.

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Right.

155
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,840
So you could even cover yourself with bug spray.

156
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Okay.

157
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,280
So every part of your body, you put bug spray on.

158
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Head to toe.

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Head to toe.

160
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,840
Now, you can cover yourself under a tree maybe.

161
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,040
Or you can cover yourself with a blanket.

162
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Okay.

163
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,840
So to cover yourself, to completely hide under something.

164
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,560
And finally, we have the response to this idea, the answer.

165
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,400
The person says, oh, without a doubt, that means absolutely or definitely.

166
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Okay.

167
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
So there is no doubt.

168
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,720
It is true or it is certain.

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Right.

170
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,480
So a doubt is something that maybe you're not so sure about.

171
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
You're not convinced.

172
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,960
But you can say, this is without a doubt the best mosquito spray.

173
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240
Or this is without a doubt the best cake I've ever eaten.

174
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
That means it's definitely the best cake I've ever eaten.

175
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
All right.

176
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,080
So I think we've covered all the phrases now.

177
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:34,200
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

178
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,520
The mosquitoes are biting me.

179
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Me too.

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I can't stop scratching.

181
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,360
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks.

182
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,560
Do you have any bug spray?

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,600
No, I forgot to buy some.

184
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,200
Then we'll have to put up with it.

185
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,360
We can cover ourselves with beer.

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,160
That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

187
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,320
That's without doubt the best idea you've ever had.

188
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Let's do it.

189
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Run.

190
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:14,600
They're thirsty for more.

191
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,080
Mosquitoes are very annoying, but at times they can be very dangerous, right?

192
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
They can.

193
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,440
There are a couple of diseases that can be passed by mosquito bites.

194
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,760
One of them is malaria.

195
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,080
And that's I think pretty common in Southeast Asia and South Asia.

196
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Now there was another situation where people believed that if a mosquito bit a person infected

197
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,200
with HIV or AIDS, they could pass it on to another person.

198
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Aha.

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,680
Well, I don't know that that's even possible because there's no AIDS carrying mosquitoes.

200
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,480
But there is another disease called dengue fever.

201
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
And this is another very dangerous one.

202
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,080
It's also known as break bone fever.

203
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,360
And I think it's so painful, it feels like your bones are breaking.

204
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,520
And that's where the name comes from.

205
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,440
It's very common in South America as well because we have such a tropical climate that

206
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,560
in the rainforests of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, it's common to see this.

207
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,040
But not so much anymore.

208
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,320
Now they're eradicating it.

209
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Wow.

210
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Alright.

211
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
So an interesting topic.

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,200
Mosquitoes are not only irritating, but can be dangerous.
