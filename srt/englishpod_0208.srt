00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,240
My name is Catherine and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,440
about money.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
That's right.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
We are going to talk about the stock market.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,640
So a very interesting topic, very current as well because well throughout the world

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,020
stock markets are not doing very well.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,280
That's right and you may have seen on the television a lot of information about this.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,920
So today we're going to hopefully explain some of the things and phrases and words that

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,240
you've been hearing.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,840
But first we've got a couple of important indicators, a couple of acronyms actually

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
that you're going to hear about.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,080
So let's look at those in today's vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,080
Vocabulary Preview.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
All right.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,720
So the first word that we have on vocabulary preview is the NASDAQ.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
NASDAQ.

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
NASDAQ.

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
N-A-S-D-A-Q.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,760
So this is basically the American stock market.

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Right.

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
It's an acronym.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
Now it's a really, really long acronym so we're not going to get into it but it is basically

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,520
the American stock market where all these companies are trading stock, publicly traded

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
companies.

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Right.

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,080
So publicly traded companies, you're basically trading their stocks through NASDAQ.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Right.

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,300
And now the next one that we have is an indicator which tells us how well some companies or

31
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,280
some stock are doing and that's the Dow Jones indicator.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,760
Dow Jones indicator.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,000
So maybe if the Dow Jones is really low for something, we think, man, it's not doing so

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
well.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If it goes up, things are improving.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Right.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,320
So usually the Dow Jones has the, it's based upon the 50 biggest companies in the United

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,880
States, the 50 biggest publicly traded companies.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,520
Now you can divide it into like industrial companies or pharmaceutical companies, etc.

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,400
But in general, that's the indicator and how it works.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Great.

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,200
So we're going to listen to today's dialogue and find out how these words are used in context

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:02,040
and we're back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,640
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
What is it?

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,880
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,040
What do you mean?

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
What happened?

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,920
There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,720
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,320
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,120
How is this possible?

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,600
are safe and making a profitable return.

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,840
I know, sir.

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,660
On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that

59
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,880
will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,200
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
Do what you have to do.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
One other thing.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
If they find out it's the end of this company.

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,680
All right, we're back.

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
So a lot of interesting words there.

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,360
I think a lot of them were very specific to the stock market and very, maybe a little

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
bit difficult.

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,320
Why don't we take a look at a couple of those and language takeaway.

70
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Language takeaway.

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,520
Okay, so this first word is a very important word in banking and finance.

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,480
We talk about portfolios a lot.

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
So portfolio.

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Right.

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,400
So basically a portfolio is the variety of things that you own.

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,160
For example, in the stock market, it could be stocks, it could be bonds, it can be mutual

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
funds, etc.

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,160
Or for example, if you're a company, your product portfolio could be all the products

79
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
that your company owns.

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
That's right.

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,560
So in this case, our portfolio is worth half what it was a week ago.

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,920
And so this is a sentence that means, we've lost half of the money we invested.

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,200
All of our investments are in a portfolio.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,840
We talk about them as a portfolio.

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,880
And when we lose money, we say our portfolio is worth less now than it was before.

86
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Exactly.

87
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,040
So moving on, he starts to talk about the bull market and the bear market.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
So what is this all about?

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Well, a bull is an animal with horns.

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,480
And a bear is another animal.

91
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,840
So we're not talking about animals here.

92
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,040
We're talking about special finance phrases.

93
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,360
So the bull market would be, again, talking about companies and trading.

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,180
It would be maybe a market that's growing very rapidly.

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,440
That's very, very strong.

96
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,720
That's a bull market.

97
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,960
So people often talk about China's bull market, right?

98
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,920
How China continues to grow and grow and grow and grow.

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,120
But a market that slows down, like the United States last year, would be a bear market.

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Right.

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,220
So think of a bear, maybe it's sleeping, it goes into hibernation.

102
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,220
That's a bear market.

103
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,880
So a slow market.

104
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,200
It's not really growing.

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Very good.

106
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,720
But talking about a portfolio again, we might have stocks.

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,480
But in this case, the two people are talking about their bonds.

108
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,600
So he says, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds.

109
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,400
What's a high yield bond and what's a trash bond?

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Okay.

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
So when we think about the word yield is how much it gives, right?

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,880
So how much we are getting from it.

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,360
So something that is high yield means that you're getting a lot from it.

114
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,360
For example, this orange tree yields 300 oranges per year.

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Okay.

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
So how much we get from it.

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Exactly.

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
So we're getting 300 oranges.

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,040
That's how much it's yielding.

120
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,320
And so basically that's what yield means.

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,040
So when we talk about trash bonds, this on the other hand, it's a word that's maybe a

122
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,200
little bit tricky, but a bond is a promise that you get from the seller that he's going

123
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,120
to pay you back the money that you give him with interest.

124
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,040
But a trash bond is a very risky bond.

125
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,600
It means that the seller might not pay you back because he's still trying to get all

126
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
the money.

127
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,640
Right, but a high yield trash bond means that you might make a lot of money from this bond

128
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,880
unless of course it's not very dependable.

129
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Exactly.

130
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
So it's risky.

131
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Of course, since it's riskier, it has more yield.

132
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Great.

133
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,560
So high yields trash bond.

134
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,920
And then what about this?

135
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,960
They will give us liquidity to cut our losses.

136
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Liquidity.

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
We hear all about liquidity in finance.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Exactly.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
Maybe in your company, the accountant will talk about this.

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,200
And that's basically just to have money cash in hand.

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,280
So you have money to pay things or to buy things.

142
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Not with...

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
So it's available.

144
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Available, yeah.

145
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Not with credit.

146
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
The opposite of credit.

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
Okay, liquidity.

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,840
And finally, instead, what are we going to do?

149
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
Let's think outside the box.

150
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,860
We could reinvest in emerging markets.

151
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,680
And this is a very hot topic lately, talking about emerging markets.

152
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,760
So to emerge means to come up, to rise.

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Yeah, to come out.

154
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,720
So it's almost like new or growing markets.

155
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,480
So in this case, a market, an emerging market would be, for example, the Southeast Asian

156
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,440
market, which is growing quickly, or even you could say West African market.

157
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,920
We're talking about places in the world that aren't established.

158
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,440
They're not old and dependable.

159
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,640
They're new and exciting.

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Right.

161
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
So they're coming up.

162
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,520
So that's an emerging market.

163
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,640
So a lot of very interesting words and phrases.

164
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,420
They're very related to our topic.

165
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,520
And so why don't we move on now.

166
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,780
Let's take a look at two key phrases on Fluency Builder.

167
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,220
Fluency Builder.

168
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,540
This first phrase is something we've heard a lot about in the last year or two with things

169
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,640
not going so well in the world of finance.

170
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,400
The first one, here we go, to cut our losses.

171
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,240
Okay, so let's cut our losses.

172
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,080
So when you talk about cutting your losses, that means to try and stop losing money somehow,

173
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,680
maybe sell early.

174
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
That's right.

175
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
So in this case, we're losing money.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's stop now.

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's stop everything.

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cut our losses.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That means cut them away.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Forget about them.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320
Throw them away and start again.

182
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay, so we could say, my business is failing.

183
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,320
I'm going to cut my losses, sell the business and start again.

184
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Right.

185
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
That's exactly it.

186
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,120
So to cut your losses means to stop doing something, maybe sell it and stop losing money.

187
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
Basically, you accept the fact that you lost it.

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,200
You can't get it back and start again.

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,600
So when they were talking about investing in emerging markets, he said, well, maybe

190
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,320
we could do this and that would force us to think outside the box.

191
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,960
Okay, this is a great phrase and you might hear this in meetings a lot or from your manager.

192
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,240
What's going on here is these two people are talking about how they lost a lot of money.

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
The economy is bad and they've been doing things in a normal way for a long time.

194
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
It's not working.

195
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,680
Let's think outside the box.

196
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,120
That means let's be creative.

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,040
Let's try and discover new ways of doing things that will yield positive results.

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
That's right.

199
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,120
This is a very, very common phrase, very widely used in business or when you're talking about

200
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
ideas is people tell you to think outside the box to maybe break some of the rules.

201
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Right, right.

202
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,400
Don't just think the way that you always do.

203
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,960
Don't do the same thing over and over.

204
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Do something new, be creative, come up with something great.

205
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,880
So that's thinking outside the box.

206
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
Right, very good.

207
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,000
So a lot of great phrases there.

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
I think we've learned quite a bit.

209
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit

210
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:36,480
more about this very interesting topic.

211
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,360
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

212
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
What is it?

213
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,600
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

214
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,760
What do you mean?

215
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
What happened?

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,640
There are many factors that weigh in, but Nasdaq is down 200 points.

217
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,440
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

218
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,040
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

219
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,840
How is this possible?

220
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,480
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments

221
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,320
are safe and making a profitable return.

222
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,560
I know, sir.

223
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,560
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

224
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,360
On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that

225
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,600
will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,880
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

227
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
Do what you have to do.

228
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
One other thing.

229
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

230
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,720
If they find out it's the end of this company.

231
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,080
So I remember being a little kid and watching TV with my parents and on the news there was

232
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,880
always the business segment and in this you'd always hear the Nasdaq is down 10 points.

233
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
The Dow Jones Industrial today is down 10 points.

234
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Yesterday was up two.

235
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
That's an average of H. Okay.

236
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,680
Yeah, it's very complicated, especially if you take a look also in the newspaper.

237
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,840
Sometimes it shows you different publicly traded companies and it has a bunch of numbers.

238
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
It's a very interesting topic.

239
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,600
It's almost a science, I think.

240
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,480
Very much a science and some people have made a lot of money playing the stock market and

241
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,000
trying to buy stocks when they're low, wait until they're high, sell them off and make

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
tons.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,160
Yeah, it's pretty much analyzing risk.

244
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,320
So making calculated decisions and that's why they use all these formulas and all these

245
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:40,480
different ratios and ways to ponder how much they should invest or what would they gain.

246
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,600
So it's very, very interesting.

247
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,040
Many people compare it to gambling, but it's kind of like gambling but not really because

248
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,380
you don't really depend on luck.

249
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,120
You kind of make calculated decisions.

250
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,320
And sometimes you're trading for big, big companies or even parts of big markets like

251
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,920
parts of entire countries.

252
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,400
A lot of people, for example, stockbrokers will invest a group of workers' retirement

253
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
funds.

254
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,960
They will take those funds and be like, hey, you're maybe getting 5% from the bank for

255
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,480
keeping your money there.

256
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,320
Give me the money and I'll give you 25% yield on your investment.

257
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,800
And so obviously they're playing not only their reputation but also with other people's

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,840
life savings.

259
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,560
And that's why a lot of people lost money when two years ago the bubble really burst

260
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
in a lot of areas like real estate.

261
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
Stock prices went down.

262
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,520
The United States went into a recession.

263
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,040
And all these people's retirement funds, their savings, they lost it.

264
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,120
So you got to be careful with this kind of stuff and do your homework.

265
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
But that's about it for us today.

266
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,960
Hope that you've enjoyed this lesson.

We'll see everyone there.

270
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Bye.

271
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,800
