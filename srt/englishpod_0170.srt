00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,360
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,280
And today we're talking about a very important day in a couple's life.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
That's right.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,660
We're going to a wedding.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,520
But this time, it's not going to be so romantic because actually the groom is having second

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,840
thoughts about the wedding.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,240
Okay, that means he's nervous and he's not positive he wants to get married today.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,440
So remember the groom is the man, the bride is the woman.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,400
Let's jump right into this dialogue.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,440
Listen to what's going on and when we come back, we'll be talking about some of the words

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,400
and phrases you've heard.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,280
Man, I'm freaking out.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,800
You gotta help me.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,920
Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Relax.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's going on?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,360
I can't go through with this.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I just can't.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm not ready for marriage.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
What was I thinking?

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm only 35 years old.

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,080
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Adventure's waiting.

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,320
I can't settle down yet.

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,480
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,600
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,080
the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,360
I know, I know.

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
Let's think this through.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,800
woman of your dreams.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,200
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,760
Second of all, you are just getting cold feet.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,640
You know deep down inside that you want to marry her.

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,320
So cut the crap and do it.

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
You're right.

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm being crazy.

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,960
Okay, I'm ready.

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Let's do this.

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Great.

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,920
Phew, that was a close one.

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,320
You had me going there for a minute.

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,040
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Alright, we're back.

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
So almost, he almost didn't get married, but luckily you have a good friend to help you

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
out.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,920
So this friend really saved the day, made sure that the groom didn't get too nervous

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,680
and had some really positive words.

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,320
So let's take a listen to some of these marriage words in today's Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,440
Alright, so as you mentioned, we have this word marriage.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,480
Now marriage is the noun form, right, of actually getting married or to be married.

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Right.

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,120
Marriage is the noun, the word that describes the relationship between two married people.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,680
Okay, and so you have a relationship, maybe you're dating, but once you get married, the

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,920
thing between you as a man and a woman, that's your marriage.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Your marriage.

63
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,240
You could say our marriage is in danger.

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,960
We need to work on our marriage.

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Exactly.

66
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
It's a happy marriage.

67
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Alright.

68
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Okay, so that's marriage.

69
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,560
Now if you get married, and this guy, he mentioned a phrase which was to settle down.

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
To settle down.

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
This is a very important phrase.

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,560
To settle down means to get serious, mature, and to stop living like a child.

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,480
It means really to have a house or to start having kids.

74
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,060
It's a time in life.

75
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,880
So to settle down is to become more stable, right?

76
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,720
As you say, to buy a house, to have a family, to stay in one place and not be so adventurous

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,160
or stuff like that.

78
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
Exactly.

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,000
So it's to calm down and to be more fixed in life.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Alright.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,920
Now the opposite of this would be to be a bachelor.

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Right.

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,840
So bachelor is a single man, someone who's not married.

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,360
And you often hear this term when we talk about apartments.

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,520
So bachelor pad is an apartment that's specific to a single man.

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,800
Usually there's lots of video games and a fancy TV and a pool table.

87
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Exactly.

88
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Alright.

89
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
So bachelor.

90
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
We had a lesson about this called bachelor party.

91
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Right.

92
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Which is a party for a man right before he gets married.

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,440
And bachelor is a special word for a man who's not yet married.

94
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Okay.

95
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Very good.

96
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,560
And now as they were talking about not getting married, he said that you can't leave Amy

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,880
at the altar.

98
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,640
So you often hear this in movies.

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,460
She got left at the altar or you can't leave her at the altar.

100
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,560
This word altar is actually religious.

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
Altar is the table in a church where the priest does all of his work.

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
Right.

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Alright.

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,960
So an altar is a special religious table.

105
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,520
So usually two people will stand in front of an altar and get married right with the

106
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,280
priest who is doing his thing there.

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Exactly.

108
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,080
He says, do you Joe take Samantha to be your bride?

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Blah, blah, blah.

110
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,320
So that happens at a special place called the altar.

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Okay.

112
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Very good.

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,400
And not at the normal mass like on Sundays.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Right.

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Okay.

116
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,440
And for the last word or phrase today, it's to get cold feet.

117
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,920
You're just getting cold feet.

118
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Okay.

119
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,240
So this is a very funny phrase in English because it doesn't actually mean that your

120
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
cold feet are cold.

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Right.

122
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,640
So cold feet means you're nervous about something.

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,360
You might change your mind.

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Okay.

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Okay.

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,960
So people often talk about men and women getting cold feet before a wedding.

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,120
But you can also relate it to any other situation, not only getting married.

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Right.

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah.

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,720
For example, I'm going to go jump out of an airplane tomorrow.

131
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Okay.

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Fast forward tomorrow.

133
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,280
Oh no, I have cold feet.

134
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
I don't think I want to jump out of an airplane.

135
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Okay.

136
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
So that's to get cold feet.

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,120
To have second thoughts or doubts about actually doing something.

138
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Exactly.

139
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Cold feet.

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Alright.

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

142
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,920
Let's keep a lookout for all of these words and we'll be back in a little bit.

143
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
Man, I'm freaking out.

144
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
You got to help me.

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Whoa, whoa.

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Take it easy.

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Relax.

148
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,200
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

149
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
What's going on?

150
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,520
I can't go through with this.

151
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
I just can't.

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm not ready for marriage.

153
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
What was I thinking?

154
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm only 35 years old.

155
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,280
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

156
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Adventure's waiting.

157
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,840
I can't settle down yet.

158
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,640
What are you talking about?

159
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,760
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living

160
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,440
the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

161
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
I know.

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
I know.

163
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,960
Let's think this through.

164
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,720
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the

166
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,960
woman of your dreams.

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,920
Second of all, you are just getting cold feet.

169
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,780
You know deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

170
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,480
So cut the crap and do it.

171
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
You're right.

172
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
I'm being crazy.

173
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Okay.

174
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I'm ready.

175
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Let's do this.

176
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Great.

177
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Phew.

178
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
That was a close one.

179
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
You had me going there for a minute.

180
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,480
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

181
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
All right.

182
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,280
We're back.

183
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,280
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases that we found in this dialogue on

184
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,080
Fluency Builder.

185
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,840
Fluency Builder.

186
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,560
This first one is a really great phrase because it's very, well, it's easy to picture this

187
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
what we're describing.

188
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,400
To sweat like a pig.

189
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
To sweat like a pig.

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Okay.

191
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
You're sweating like a pig.

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
All right.

193
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,120
This is a way to say that someone is sweating a lot.

194
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
A lot.

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Okay.

196
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
And it's really gross or disgusting.

197
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,240
Now do pigs actually sweat?

198
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,200
I don't know if pigs actually sweat but you imagine someone smells bad and they have sweat

199
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,160
on their face and their back and their arms.

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
All right.

201
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,480
Well, sometimes don't you say you're sweating like a dog?

202
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,560
You could also say that.

203
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,440
I guess we like animals in English but this is just a really great way to say that someone

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,160
is really sweaty.

205
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
All right.

206
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,280
And well, he was sweating and he was really nervous because he said, I can't go through

207
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
with this.

208
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,560
What does he mean go through with this?

209
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
With what?

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,040
To go through with means to actually do something.

211
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Okay.

212
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,160
So maybe I say, I don't want to jump out of an airplane.

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,720
I can't go through with this.

214
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Okay.

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I can't jump.

216
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,560
So it depends on what we're actually talking about.

217
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,200
If we're talking about a wedding, you say, I can't go through with this.

218
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
I can't get married.

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,320
So if you're planning a robbery, you say, well, in the last minute, I couldn't go through

220
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
with it.

221
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
I backed out.

222
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't complete what I talked about doing.

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,280
And now the friend, he finally gets kind of angry and he says, cut the crap.

225
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Oh man, this is a very common phrase.

226
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
All right.

227
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
This is someone says this if they don't want to listen to you complain anymore.

228
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Okay.

229
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Marco, cut the crap.

230
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Okay.

231
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
I don't want to hear your excuses.

232
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,840
I don't want to hear your complaints.

233
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,560
I want to just hear solutions, solutions, ideas, positive things.

234
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,080
So to cut the crap is no more complaints, no more excuses or no more talking nonsense.

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Exactly.

236
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,440
And this is, this is common among teachers and well, parents.

237
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,020
All right.

238
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
So cut the crap.

239
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,840
Now it's not very polite, right?

240
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,000
So you wouldn't really say it to your boss or like a friend.

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,760
Cut the crap is kind of rude and it's very spoken language.

242
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,320
So I wouldn't write it down and I would not use this with someone who is like a teacher.

243
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, yeah, like an authority.

244
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
You don't use it with them.

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
They might use it with you.

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,760
And for our last phrase, he said, whew, you had me going there for a while or you had

247
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,320
me going there for a minute.

248
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay.

249
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,800
So this is a really interesting phrase.

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,960
We use this a lot in English, but it's not clear from listening to it what it might mean.

251
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,840
So you had me going there in this sense means, Oh, I was really nervous for a minute.

252
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,920
I really believed what you were saying.

253
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Exactly.

254
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,880
So maybe we could give an example, Marco.

255
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
All right.

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
Um, did you know that yesterday I won the lottery?

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,160
I mean, I won like a million dollars and I had the perfect numbers.

258
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Oh my God.

259
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Really?

260
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Can I have a million dollars?

261
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,720
I would love to help you out, man.

262
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,240
But uh, yeah, no, I didn't actually win a million dollars.

263
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
You had me going there for a minute.

264
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
You actually did for a little while.

265
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
You believed me.

266
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Okay.

267
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Maybe not.

268
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
He's not that gullible.

269
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
All right.

270
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,120
But that, that's what it means, right?

271
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,920
To believe someone's story or to think that, um, something's going to happen even though

272
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
it doesn't.

273
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
You had me going there.

274
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,000
That means what you thought was going to happen, didn't happen.

275
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
So you can use it in the third person is like, yeah, I was telling him this awesome story

276
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
and I really had him going for a while.

277
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
He really believed me.

278
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,080
And then I told him it wasn't true.

279
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Okay.

280
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Great phrases.

281
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, that's it for today's episode of the podcast.

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600

Bye.

297

Bye.

298

Bye.

299

Bye.

303

Bye.

304
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Bye.

305
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Bye.

306
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Bye.

307
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Bye.

308
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Bye.

309
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Bye.

310
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Bye.

311
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We're never done, Amy, you've got an entire life ahead of me.

312
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Adventures waiting.

313
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I can't settle down yet.

314
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
What are you talking about?

315
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living

316
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
the life of a Bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

317
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
I know.

318
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
Let's think this through.

319
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,560
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

320
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,040
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she's the woman that you love and the

321
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,820
woman of your dreams.

322
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,200
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

323
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,680
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

324
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,560
You know deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

325
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
So cut the crap and do it.

326
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
You're right.

327
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm being crazy.

328
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,880
Okay, I'm ready.

329
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Let's do this.

330
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Great.

331
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Phew.

332
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
That was a close one.

333
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,240
You had me going there for a minute.

334
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:50,000
Alright, so this is a popular scenario, right?

336
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,160
Everybody on their wedding day, they get cold feet and they back out.

337
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,240
TV, movies, books, everyone loves this situation.

338
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,200
Have you ever actually heard of or experienced or maybe known of somebody who actually left

339
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,280
the bride at the altar or the groom at the altar?

340
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,720
I don't know anyone who did that.

341
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Luckily, I think it's really sad.

342
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Yeah, me neither.

343
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,960
I don't think it's really that common.

344
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,040
No, but there was a movie just about this.

345
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,880
So there's a woman, Julia Roberts, who tries and tries and tries to get married but never

346
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,920
can so it's called Runaway Bride because every time she goes to the altar, she gets nervous.

347
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
She gets cold feet and she runs away.

348
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
They call her the Runaway Bride.

349
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,680
I can't imagine this actually happening to someone.

350
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,080
I mean, you have all your family there, your friends.

351
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
I know.

352
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
It'd be so embarrassing.

353
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,160
It's amazing.

354
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
And expensive.

355
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,440
Exactly, because you've already paid for everything.

356
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,600
So do you get to eat the cake if you're the one who's left behind?

357
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I think so.

358
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Everything's paid for, right?

359
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Exactly.

360
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And drink all the liquor.

361
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,660
