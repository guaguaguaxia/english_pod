00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco and I'm Erika.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're looking at some more romance. We're talking about dating.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Dating, exactly. And not only dating but asking someone to become your boyfriend or girlfriend.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yep, that's true. And so we're going to be focusing on language to express your romantic feelings.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And also maybe some phrases you can use to ask someone out.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Very good. So I'm sure you guys are excited about this one. So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hey, you're early. Where is everyone?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, I told them not to come. I made a reservation just for the two of us.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, why?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sure, what is it?

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, here's the thing. I've always seen you as more than just a friend. And I can't take it anymore.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know you better than anyone. I know the pros and cons of your personality.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I even know what side of the bed is yours. I think we would be great together, don't you?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you serious? We've been friends for years. We can't just change that overnight.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I know. I never had the guts to tell you. Until today.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So what do you say? Are you willing to give me a shot?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright, I wonder, is she going to say yes?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know. She seems a little bit confused.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, I guess it's always strange when your best friend suddenly wants to be your boyfriend or girlfriend.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It does happen though. It does happen.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this dialogue to express these feelings.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And let's start with Fluency Builder.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, so we're doing things a little differently today.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We're looking at phrases and not just vocabulary words.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So he used some wonderful phrases to ask her to be his boyfriend.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And he started with this. Here's the thing.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here's the thing.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright, that's a very strange phrase. Here's the thing. Is he giving her something?

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not quite. He's not giving her an object. But he's giving her some information.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, so it's a very common way to start an idea.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're about to tell the person the main problem or the main piece of information.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you would start with, here's the thing, and then start explaining.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, why don't we do an example?

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For example, you could say, alright, here's the thing. People don't like you.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Alright, well I hope they don't say that to me.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But another example. Marco, here's the thing. We're behind in our podcasting. We have to work overtime.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, so the main idea.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yep.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Very good. Moving on to our next phrase.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He said, I can't take it.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't take it anymore.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't take it anymore.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So he can't take it anymore. Take what?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, why don't we find out by listening to some examples.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Examples.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Example one.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The man next door has been so loud. I can't take it anymore.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Example two.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My boss always yells at me. I can't take it anymore.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Example three.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't take it anymore. I'm going to quit.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright, so basically is you can't stand it. You can't tolerate it anymore.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Exactly. This is a phrase we use when we are really frustrated.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, when we're frustrated or when we just can't handle it anymore.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And well, after he finished his declaration of love, she responded by saying, are you serious?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you serious?

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you serious?

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you serious?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, so what does she mean?

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She's just saying, really?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Exactly. It's another way of saying, really?

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah. So this is a phrase that's really, it's quite informal, isn't it?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't use it in a business context.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, and it's also something that's used mostly by younger people.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right. If you say something that's amazing or that's incredible, hard to believe, you might get this response.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you serious?

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right. So he is very serious, but he confessed that he never had the guts to tell her.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have the guts.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I never had the guts to tell you.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I never had the guts.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Alright, so to have guts.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's to be brave.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
To be brave, courageous.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yep.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we have some examples of how we would use guts in different situations, so let's listen.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Example one.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't have the guts to go skydiving.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Example two.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't have the guts to give a speech.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Example three.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've never had the guts to say no to my boss.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Alright, so to have the guts to do something.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey, but Marco, this word guts, it's an interesting one.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, it is, because guts can also mean your internal organs.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like your stomach and your intestines and your lungs.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Exactly, those are your guts.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yep, so when you have guts, you're really brave.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Exactly, you're courageous.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright, very good. Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit, and we'll come back and look at some phrases and putting it together.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey, you're early. Where's everyone?

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, I told them not to come. I made a reservation just for the two of us. I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, why?

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Sure, what is it?

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, here's the thing. I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it anymore.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know you better than anyone. I know the pros and cons of your personality. I even know what side of the bed is yours.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think we would be great together, don't you?

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Are you serious? We've been friends for years. We can't just change that overnight.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I know. I've never had the guts to tell you until today. So, what do you say? Are you willing to give me a shot?

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I... I...

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Alright, that's a little bit clearer this time. But while I was listening, I noticed that there's some more great phrases that you can use together with different words.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, let's look at those now and putting it together.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Alright, let's take a look at the first one. He said, I made a reservation just for the two of us.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The two of us?

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Just the two of us.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So, just the two of us. Quite simply, it means you and me. Just us, right?

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right. Just us. So, why is this phrase important?

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think it's a great way to show the idea of only us, right?

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And we can use it together with any number we want.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So, what about the four of us?

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Just the four of us. Just the eight of us. So, it suggests the idea of only us.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, he made the reservation just for the two of us because he thought they could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
All to ourselves.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All to ourselves.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All to ourselves.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you have something all to yourself or we have something all to ourselves.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We have that thing all alone. We don't have to share it.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We don't share. Very good.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So, I guess you can say, my parents are out of town, so I have the apartment, I have the house all to myself.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or even, she wants to eat the cake all to herself.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Very good. So, that's a very good phrase.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And you can use it with any pronoun.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, so the guy is explaining that I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've always seen you as...

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I've always seen you as...

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, basically, it's the perception or the way you consider that person.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The way you think about that person.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So, I can say, I've always seen you as a good friend.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've always seen you as a leader.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, so our last phrase is also the last thing we heard in the dialogue.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He said, are you willing to give me a shot?

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
To give me a shot.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Give me a shot.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Alright, I think we have some more examples of how we could use give me a shot in different situations.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, let's listen.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Example 1.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know I can do this drawing better. Just give me a shot.

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Example 2.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The HR manager wasn't going to hire me, but he decided to give me a shot.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, so when you give someone a shot, you take a chance, right?

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Give that person or give an opportunity.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Alright, so we don't know if she will give him a shot or not,

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:06,000
but why don't we listen to the dialogue once more to hear these phrases in action.

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, you're early. Where is everyone?

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, I told them not to come. I made a reservation just for the two of us.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, why?

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sure, what is it?

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, here's the thing. I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it anymore.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I know you better than anyone. I know the pros and cons of your personality.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I even know what side of the bed is yours. I think we would be great together, don't you?

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you serious? We've been friends for years. We can't just change that overnight.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know. I never had the guts to tell you until today.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So what do you say? Are you willing to give me a shot?

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Uh, uh...

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Alright, so an interesting dialogue, and it opens up a cultural point.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right. So in the dialogue, I'm going to ask you to give me a shot.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So in the dialogue, the guy was asking her if she would be his girlfriend, right?

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Right, but I guess it's not very common, among adults at least, in English-speaking countries.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, we don't say like, okay, so please will you be my boyfriend now?

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Right, right, right. You would do that maybe in high school.

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, but even then I think it's still a little funny.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think for us, when we start to have romantic relationships, it just sort of happens naturally, right?

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You never really have this conversation, will you be my boyfriend?

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Right, I guess afterwards you just start talking about other things,

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
which you just consider that you guys are already boyfriend and girlfriend.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But there's no real... There's no official starting point.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, there's no official point that says, okay, now we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Which is interesting because in other countries they do go through the formality of asking somebody to become their boyfriend.

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, but even, you know, like 20 or 30 years ago in English-speaking countries, you would do this.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh yeah, of course.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And it was called going steady.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Going steady.

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So you would ask, will you go steady with me?

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That means let's become a stable couple.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Exactly.

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
All right, so we want to hear your stories and well, how do you do it in your country?

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Do you ask someone out, do you maybe just give them the first kiss and that's an automatic yes?

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, I don't know, but I'm looking forward to hearing from our listeners.

186
