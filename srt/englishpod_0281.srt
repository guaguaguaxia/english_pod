00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,840
My name is Catherine and we've got a very sad dialogue today actually, Marco.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
That's right.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,240
Today we have a very sad but interesting dialogue of something that happens all the time.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,400
Maybe you have a girlfriend, maybe you had a boyfriend and you break up.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,180
That means you are no longer boyfriend and girlfriend.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,780
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
going on.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,780
Hello.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,780
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,040
No, I think I'll pass.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
Mark broke up with me.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,040
I feel awful.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
What?

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
What happened?

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,520
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,400
I don't know what I did wrong.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,880
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,840
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,600
That's so cliche.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,560
You deserve so much better.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,840
we both had some time off.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,560
I think he found someone else.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,520
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a co-worker.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Whatever.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
He's a jerk.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Forget about him.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,720
There are many more fish in the sea.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,000
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,680
But you're right.

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,720
There's no use for me to sulk around.

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Let's go out tonight.

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,720
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,920
So obviously this girl, Lydia, is very torn.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,080
She's very sad because her boyfriend broke up with her.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
That's right.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,800
She's crying the whole time this dialogue was going on.

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,240
That's right.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,880
But she did mention, her and her friend mentioned some interesting things.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,160
Why don't we take a look at some of the words they used on Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,240
Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,120
So first of all, her friend says, hey, do you want to go out tonight?

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
And what does Lydia say?

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,080
She says, no, I think I'll pass.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
All right.

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,640
So she says, I think I'll pass.

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
I will pass.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,520
So what does this verb mean, to pass?

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,960
So that means she is politely rejecting the offer or the invitation.

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
So no thanks.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
No thanks.

55
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
That's basically what it means.

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I won't go.

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,760
So, hey, Marco, you want to go see a movie in a couple hours?

58
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
No, I think I'll pass.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
I got homework to do.

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
All right.

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,360
So Marco will not come.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
That means to decline an invitation.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
That's right.

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
So that's what it means to pass.

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Now, as they continue to talk, they mention some of the problems with their boyfriend,

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,960
but Maggie said, ugh, that's so cliche.

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,120
So the boyfriend said something and Maggie thinks that what he said was very, very cliche.

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,520
So what is something that is cliche?

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,120
Cliche means something that is said or done very often.

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,560
It's almost like we would expect it.

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,760
So like, for example, what's a cliche phrase or a cliche action?

72
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,520
Well, in the dialogue, they were talking about ways of breaking up with people.

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,480
So for example, it's not you, it's me.

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Let's break up.

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,160
So that's a cliche because it's a sentence, it's a phrase everyone always says.

76
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,320
It's not very, maybe not very honest.

77
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Or like a movie cliche would be, you know, a couple, they're getting married, but their

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,320
parents, the parents of the bride, they're divorced.

79
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,500
They hate each other.

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,720
But then at the wedding, they get back together.

81
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,320
They're going to get married again.

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,480
That's a cliche story.

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
That's right.

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Because you've heard it before.

85
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Right.

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
All the time.

87
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
It's very common.

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,480
So something that's very common, something that you would expect, that's almost, that's

89
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
a cliche.

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,920
And a cliche, calling something a cliche is not a good thing.

91
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
It's usually a bad thing.

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
That's right.

93
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Okay.

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,440
So Maggie goes on to say that, you know, this guy, Mark, her ex-boyfriend, he's not really

95
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
worth it.

96
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,560
But she says, you deserve so much better.

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Okay.

98
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,640
So to deserve is a verb and it means that you should receive something or you should

99
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,680
expect something.

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,280
So almost like, you know, in this case, you deserve better.

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
You have earned something better.

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
You're a good person.

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,920
You should receive a, you know, you should have a good boyfriend.

104
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
That's right.

105
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,440
So when, when she says you deserve so much better, she's talking about deserving a better

106
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
guy, a better man.

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,160
Or for example, so Marco, you work so hard at school.

108
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,340
You're always doing your homework.

109
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,480
You really deserve good grades.

110
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,360
It means you should receive good grades.

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Very good.

112
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,840
Now, when Lydia said, yeah, you know what?

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,800
I just thought we were having some problems and we had hit a rough patch.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,660
So she's talking about a rough patch.

115
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
What is that?

116
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,760
A rough patch is actually something we talk about a lot in spoken English.

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,600
It's a way to describe a period of time, so maybe a week or a month when things are difficult,

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,040
you know, when maybe you argue with your boyfriend or girlfriend or when you're sad a lot or

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,240
when you're confused.

120
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,680
And so a period of time when you're angry or sad with your boyfriend or girlfriend,

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,760
that's a rough patch.

122
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,040
So maybe we can apply a rough patch to another situation like at work.

123
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
Maybe you're going through a rough patch at work.

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
That means I'm always busy.

125
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm always tired.

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,960
I don't feel happy with my job.

127
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm going through a rough patch.

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
So it's usually a temporary period of time where things are going bad.

129
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
It could be a week.

130
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
It could be a month.

131
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,920
It could be a year.

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,160
But it's a fixed amount of time.

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
It's not forever.

134
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
It's just a period.

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
Okay, very good.

136
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,600
And Lydia went on to say that, you know, she thought that maybe he was going out with someone

137
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,600
else and she was suspicious because he was spending a lot of time with some other girl.

138
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay, so to be suspicious is to think that something is happening, but you don't know.

139
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,240
So for example, Marco, I think you've been taking the milk from the kitchen.

140
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,200
You are always drinking coffee and you always take milk in your coffee and there's no more

141
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
milk.

142
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
So I think it was you.

143
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,540
I'm being suspicious.

144
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm thinking that maybe you did something bad or wrong.

145
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,960
But I'm guilty.

146
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,280
So maybe you're suspicious that someone is stealing the milk or maybe you suspect or

147
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,200
you're suspicious that your next door neighbor is maybe a car thief.

148
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Right.

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,320
So you're very suspicious.

150
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,200
That means you're always thinking that this person or someone else is doing something

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
bad.

152
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
That's right.

153
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay, so a lot of words there talking about relationships, talking about cliches.

154
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
Why don't we go back?

155
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,760
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

156
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Hello?

157
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,040
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

158
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,480
No, I think I'll pass.

159
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,720
Mark broke up with me.

160
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,360
I feel awful.

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
What?

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
What happened?

163
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,960
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

164
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,840
I don't know what I did wrong.

165
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,300
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

166
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,240
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

167
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,040
That's so cliche.

168
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,520
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

169
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,980
You deserve so much better.

170
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,040
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,280
we both had some time off.

172
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,000
I think he found someone else.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,960
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a co-worker.

174
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Whatever.

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
He's a jerk.

176
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Forget about him.

177
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,200
There are many more fish in the sea.

178
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

179
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,200
But you're right.

180
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
There's no use for me to sulk around.

181
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Let's go out tonight.

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,080
All right, we're back.

183
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,320
Now let's take a look at some of those phrases on Fluency Builder.

184
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Fluency Builder.

185
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,520
All right, so Marco, these are cliche phrases that we hear in English when people are breaking

186
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
up.

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,360
There's some breaking up phrases, but there's also phrases that you might hear from your

188
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,680
friend after you have a breakup.

189
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,120
The first phrase we're going to look at, I think, is to need space.

190
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,600
He said he needed some space.

191
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:52,400
That's a cliche phrase, as we said, but it means that maybe her ex-boyfriend or Mark

192
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,720
needs more space, needs more time to be on his own or needs more time to do his own things.

193
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
That's right.

194
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,800
When you're in a relationship, you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you're always together.

195
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,400
I need some space means I want to be alone.

196
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,960
I don't want to be with my boyfriend or girlfriend.

197
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,800
Sometimes this is just a small period.

198
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Sometimes it's forever.

199
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It depends.

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
That's right.

201
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,520
When somebody says that they need space, it means they need a little bit of more time

202
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,960
to be on their own or to be alone, as you said.

203
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
He had also given her another cliche phrase.

204
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,480
Mark said that she is not the one for him.

205
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Okay, so the emphasis here is the one.

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
The one.

207
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,280
She's not the one for him.

208
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,000
In English, we often talk about the one.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,520
This means the person that you will marry, the love of your life.

210
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,080
Your significant other, your other half.

211
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
That's right.

212
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,160
You hope that you will marry the one.

213
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Her boyfriend realized.

214
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,160
He said, listen, I like you, but you're not the one.

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
You're not the person that I will marry.

216
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,160
This is a phrase you often hear in breakups.

217
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,320
If you're single, maybe you don't have a boyfriend or you're not married, you might say that

218
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,600
you haven't found the one.

219
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,520
Or yeah, you have a lot of different boyfriends, but you still haven't found the one.

220
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
That means the one you will marry.

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
That's right.

222
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Very good.

223
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Very good.

224
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,320
And now towards the end of the dialogue, Maggie also gives her some advice and said, you know

225
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
what?

226
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Forget about him.

227
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
There are many more fish in the sea.

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,120
Okay, so this is a phrase that we often say when we're trying to make somebody feel better.

229
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
So the person is sad and we want to make them happy.

230
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,400
And so there are many more fish in the sea means that there are other men in the world.

231
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,480
Okay, you're sad.

232
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
You broke up.

233
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
I understand.

234
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,960
But there are so many other men you could date.

235
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
So she's trying to say, hey, listen, look at this world.

236
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
There's so many different options.

237
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
That's right.

238
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,480
So it's the similarity of how in the sea you have so many fish, in the world you have so

239
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,400
many men, so don't worry about it.

240
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,920
And you can say this about women too.

241
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,960
So for example, if I'm talking to my male friend or my brother and my brother just broke

242
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,520
up with his girlfriend, I can say, hey, listen, there are many more fish in the sea, many

243
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
other women.

244
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,760
So don't worry about it.

245
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Don't worry about it.

246
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
You'll be okay.

247
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
And Lydia says, you know what?

248
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,200
I think you're right.

249
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,040
And there's really no use for me to sulk around.

250
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,840
So what does she mean to sulk around?

251
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
To sulk.

252
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,800
Now this is something that is very visual for me.

253
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,360
I see somebody sulking.

254
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,800
Their head is low.

255
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,560
They're sad.

256
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Someone who is sulking often wears their sweatpants or their pajamas.

257
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,680
They don't make themselves look good.

258
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,920
To sulk around means to be in your house, to be sad, to watch TV and eat ice cream.

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,280
So stop sulking.

260
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Don't look sad.

261
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Be happy.

262
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,160
To sulk is to act sad and to be very down.

263
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,000
So it's kind of like you're very, it's kind of a combination of being lazy and also sad

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,520
at the same time because something bad happened to you.

265
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Exactly.

266
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,240
And so we often say that in English, teenagers like to sulk.

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,680
You know, oh, I'm so angry at my parents.

268
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,640
And your parents will say, hey, stop sulking.

269
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Go study.

270
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
That's right.

271
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Very good.

272
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Okay.

273
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
So a lot of great phrases here.

274
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I think we can go back.

275
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Let's watch the dialogue one last time.

276
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Hello?

277
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

278
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,240
No, I think I'll pass.

279
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,520
Mark broke up with me.

280
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,200
I feel awful.

281
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
What?

282
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
What happened?

283
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,720
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

284
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,600
I don't know what I did wrong.

285
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,060
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

286
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,920
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

287
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,800
That's so cliche.

288
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,280
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

289
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,740
You deserve so much better.

290
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,800
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when

291
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,040
we both had some time off.

292
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,720
I think he found someone else.

293
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,680
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a co-worker.

294
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Whatever.

295
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
He's a jerk.

296
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Forget about him.

297
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,920
There are many more fish in the sea.

298
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,200
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

299
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,880
But you're right.

300
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,920
There's no use for me to sulk around.

301
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Let's go out tonight.

302
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,400
All right.

303
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,800
So talking about breakups, these cliche lines, and Maggie's obviously upset.

304
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,240
What other cliche lines or breakup phrases have you heard apart from, it's not you, it's

305
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,640
me, you're just not the one.

306
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,760
I need some space.

307
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,920
I think of you more like a friend.

308
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,120
There's a boyfriend or girlfriend, but then there's a friend.

309
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
So listen, I like you, but I think of you more like a friend.

310
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,640
I think that's a typical one.

311
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,760
Especially if you're asking someone out on a date, they might say that, oh, I really

312
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,040
like you, but I see you more as a friend than anything else.

313
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,200
So there's another one that's very popular.

314
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,080
Sometimes you hear people say, I'm just not ready for a relationship.

315
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,880
And that's also a cliche line.

316
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,120
Or I'm not ready to commit.

317
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm not ready to commit.

318
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,920
And it's interesting because I think breaking up is one of the hardest things that people

319
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
can do.

320
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,320
And I think maybe this is why you just use one of these phrases that are so popular and

321
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,040
common because I guess it's kind of a good way to explain in very soft terms what you

322
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,840
want to say and to break up with someone.

323
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
That's right.

324
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
And I think that sometimes people are afraid to make the other person sad.

325
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,200
And so they say these things that are very general, like it's not you, it's me.

326
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,440
But sometimes this makes the other person even more sad because they don't understand

327
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,680
why that they're breaking up.

328
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,360
What about breaking up over the telephone or breaking up with a letter?

329
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,240
Generally, at least in America, we say that breaking up over email or letter or phone

330
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,280
is not a good way to end a relationship.

331
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,360
It's very cold.

332
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
It's very cold.

333
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
So the other person would be very angry if that happened.

334
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
That's right.

335
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,280
You just want to see the person and say, listen, let's have a conversation.

336
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Let's talk about this face to face.

337
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Okay.

338
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,920
So this is actually very interesting because as we say, maybe in other countries or in

339
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,720
other cultures, it's not really a negative thing to break up over the phone or maybe

340
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,880
send an email saying, you know what, I don't want to see you anymore.

341
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Right.

342
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,880
So I'd be very curious to hear about you guys and your cultures and what happens when people

343
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,720
break up where you live.

344
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,760
So let us know.

345
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,920
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

346
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
We hope to see you there.

347
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,840
And of course, we hope that you haven't had any very bad breakup experiences.

348
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,960
But if you're comfortable sharing, we'd like to hear about your culture and your background.
