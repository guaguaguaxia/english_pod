00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,060
My name is Catherine and today we are cleaning, right Marco?

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,060
That's right.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,060
Today we are cleaning our house.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,280
It's not one of our favorite activities but we have to do it and so we're going to take

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,840
a look at a lot of great vocab related to household chores.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
That's right.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,360
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,520
Kevin, what is this mess?

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,800
It looks like a pigsty in here.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Clean this up.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Okay, dad.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,080
I will do it in a minute.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Let me just finish this level of this game.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,600
No, I said now.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,960
Plus, you are grounded.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,720
You're not allowed to play video games.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,680
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
That's so unfair.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,320
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,160
My house, my rules.

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,400
And I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture and vacuumed the rugs.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,400
That's great but you still have work to do so get to it.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,600
So today on Language Takeaway, let's take a look at all the verbs and all the ways that

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
we have to clean the house.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,120
So starting with the first one, we have to make the bed, make your bed.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Make your bed.

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,200
Okay, so this might sound quite strange because the verb to make is something we say for a

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
lot of different things like make a deal.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Make a mistake.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Make a mistake.

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
But here, we're making the bed.

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,240
That means we're putting the pillows on top of the bed and we're going to make sure the

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,360
blanket is even.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,560
So when you get out of bed, if everything is very messy, when you make it, you put everything

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,080
in order on your bed.

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
That's right.

39
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
That's right.

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,440
And well, it's also confusing because our next verb is to do the laundry.

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
All right.

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,520
So you make your bed but you do the laundry.

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,920
The laundry here means you clean the dirty clothes.

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Right, right.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,920
So this is one of the very, I would say, confusing parts of English where it's kind of confusing

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,440
when to use the verb make, when to use the verb do.

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,160
So usually, you make a mistake as we say or you make a cake but you do your homework.

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,240
So in these cases, you just kind of have to memorize that you make the bed but you do

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
the laundry.

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Exactly.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
So this is very common actually to do the laundry.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
I have to go do the laundry today because it's an event.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
You know, you have to gather your clothes and put in the detergent and wash it and dry

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
it.

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,680
So just remember, make the bed, do the laundry but then how do we clean those floors?

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
All right.

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,560
So the floor, we have to do two things.

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,600
We sweep the floors.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,160
So the verb there is to sweep.

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
And how do you sweep?

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,740
You actually use a broom to sweep.

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,840
So the broom is like a straw.

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,760
It's like a brush almost that you use on the floor and you collect all of the hair and

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,480
the dust and these things and you put it into the garbage bin.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,740
But after you sweep, then you need to use water to clean because obviously, sweeping

66
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,280
is just for dry things.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,600
Mopping is actually how you clean with water and soap.

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
That's right.

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,720
So now the verb there is to mop the floors and usually, you use water, you use soap and

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,360
you use a mop.

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,720
So you use a mop to mop.

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Exactly.

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
The verb is to mop.

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,240
The noun, the object is a mop like you say.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,320
So I'm going to mop the floors, right?

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,800
So please don't come into the kitchen.

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Right.

78
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Right.

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Okay.

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,960
And well, now we need to clean the furniture and usually, on the furniture, we have a lot

81
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,300
of dust.

82
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,440
So we need to dust the furniture, to dust.

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
To dust.

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,800
Yeah, this is something we don't use for the floors really because we have this great verb

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,240
to sweep.

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,960
But with furniture and things like that, we say to dust and this means we're going to

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,640
collect the dust off of the piano or the sofa or the table.

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Right.

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Exactly.

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,680
And now, the floors we clean, the furniture we clean, but sometimes we have rugs or we

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,320
have carpet in our house, usually in the bedrooms or we have a large rug in the living room

92
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,640
and we need to clean that as well, but we don't really mop it and we don't sweep it.

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,600
It's best to vacuum it.

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
All right.

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,400
So the verb is to vacuum and what is the noun, the thing we use?

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,560
A vacuum cleaner.

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,640
A vacuum cleaner or just simply a vacuum.

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,120
Now this is something that uses air to suck up all of the dirt and garbage.

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,520
So it goes and it sucks up all of that bad stuff and so we don't have to dust it.

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,040
And obviously, with carpet, we can't really use water.

101
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Exactly.

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,160
So carpet is a great tool for cleaning fabric like carpets and rugs.

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Very good.

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,320
So that's all the ways that we can basically, the verbs that we use to clean around the

105
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
house.

106
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,920
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

107
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,080
Kevin, what is this mess?

108
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,320
It looks like a pigsty in here.

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Clean this up.

110
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Okay, dad.

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
I will do it in a minute.

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
Let me just finish this level of this game.

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
No.

114
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Now, plus you are grounded.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,240
You're not allowed to play video games.

116
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,200
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

117
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,920
That's so unfair.

118
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

119
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,680
My house, my rules.

120
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,900
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture and vacuumed the rugs.

121
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,200
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

122
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:41,440
All right, so now let's take a look at some phrases, three of them on Fluency Builder.

123
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,000
All right, now the first word here is pigsty.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,080
The dad says, Kevin, it looks like a pigsty in here.

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Clean this up.

126
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,360
Right, so a pigsty.

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
It looks like a pigsty.

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,000
Now, a pigsty is where pigs live, right?

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, is it really a pigsty?

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not really a pigsty.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,120
There are no pigs living there, but to say that a room is like a pigsty means that it's

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,520
very, very, very dirty.

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Right.

135
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,720
It looks almost like the mud and the dirty place where pigs live.

136
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Exactly.

137
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,400
So, he's saying, you're living in a dirty room.

138
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,560
You need to clean this.

139
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Right.

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,200
So, a room or a house will look like a pigsty.

141
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,640
Now, the dad is actually making him do a lot of work because he says the kid is grounded.

142
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
You're grounded.

143
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,840
You're not allowed to play video games.

144
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,800
Now, a parent will ground a child, it's a verb, when the child does something bad.

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Right.

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,520
So, maybe the child gets very, very bad grades at school and the parent says, ugh, you're

147
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,160
grounded for one week.

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,840
That means you can't go out, you can't play video games.

149
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,920
There are different rules in every family, but to say you're grounded means you're being

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,440
punished for something.

151
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Right.

152
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,320
So, the verb is to ground and you can also be grounded.

153
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,600
And if you're grounded, you can say, I'm sorry, I can't go out today, I'm grounded.

154
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Exactly.

155
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,200
So, to be grounded is not a fun situation, but obviously the father is saying, listen,

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
you're grounded.

157
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,520
You have time to do all of this work.

158
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Right.

159
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
And well, this is something that my dad used to say to me, well, you have to pull your

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
weight around here.

161
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,880
So, you have to pull your weight around here.

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
What does that mean?

163
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
To pull your weight.

164
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,600
Well, you think about it, if you're not carrying yourself, someone else is carrying you, it

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,520
means that they're doing more work than they should be.

166
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Right.

167
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,160
So, you're basically being asked to do your part, to be responsible for yourself so that

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
other people like your mom and dad don't have to be responsible for you.

169
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Right.

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,640
So, you have to help out and collaborate.

171
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Exactly.

172
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,280
So, say there's three people, mom, dad, and a son.

173
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,520
If mom does all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the washing, then the other two, they're

174
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
not pulling their weight.

175
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,920
So, she says, pull your weight, do some cleaning, do some washing.

176
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Right.

177
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,120
So, if your mom cooks and then you wash the dishes, then you are pulling your weight.

178
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
You're helping.

179
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
You're helping out.

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Exactly.

181
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
All right.

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
A lot of great stuff.

183
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,520
Let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

184
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,560
Kevin, what is this mess?

185
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,800
It looks like a pigsty in here.

186
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Clean this up.

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Okay, dad.

188
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
I will do it in a minute.

189
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Let me just finish this level of this game.

190
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,480
No, I said now.

191
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
Plus, you are grounded.

192
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,720
You're not allowed to play video games.

193
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,680
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.

194
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,440
That's so unfair.

195
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,320
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
My house, my rules.

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,400
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.

198
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,680
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.

199
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,760
Okay, very good.

200
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,080
So, doing household chores, not a fun thing.

201
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,440
But also, being grounded.

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,400
Why do we consider chores to be kind of like a punishment?

203
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,840
Well, there's punishment where you sit alone in your room and you think about your actions,

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,920
and then there's punishment that's more proactive.

205
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,440
Mom and dad say, okay, well, he's grounded.

206
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Let's have him work.

207
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,940
Let's make him do something.

208
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,240
Let's make him do something so that we're benefiting from his punishment.

209
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,120
I think it's also good when children are grounded because it makes them realize that they need

210
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,240
to help out around the house.

211
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,440
This work, it doesn't get done magically.

212
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,040
There's actually someone doing it.

213
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Right.

214
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,400
And it's not like, well, in many cases in many countries, people will have, like we

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,880
saw in our previous lesson, a domestic maid, a cleaning lady, that will usually do everything

216
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,240
so maybe the kid will become very comfortable and not really do anything.

217
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Or very lazy.

218
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Very lazy.

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Even worse, yeah.

220
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,360
So, I definitely remember in my house we had chores because when it's not punishment,

221
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,680
when it's your parents' expectation normally, that's called a chore.

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,160
And they say, okay, Catherine, your chores this week, you need to take the garbage outside,

223
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,360
you need to wash the dishes, and you need to make your bed every day.

224
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,000
And then maybe my brother had to help cook and clean the floor, mop the floors and sweep.

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,120
So we have different chores.

226
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Right.

227
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,480
And I guess this is more common especially if both parents work and everyone is collaborating

228
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,440
or pulling their weight in the house.

229
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,200
And if you don't have a cleaning lady, for example.

230
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Exactly.

231
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Very interesting topic.

232
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,080
Well, that's all the time we have for today.
