00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,740
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,260
And my name is Kathryn.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,780
So Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,740
Today, we're talking about a very interesting topic.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,100
You've probably seen it on every TV show or American movie and it's a bachelor party.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,100
Uh-oh.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,100
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,340
I've heard bad things.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,700
Bad things about a bachelor party.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,500
Now, they can be fun, but at times, they can be a little bit too excessive, too much.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,340
But before we get started on the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,340
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,940
Well, the first one we've got here is the topic of today.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,220
This is the bachelor party.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,740
So what is a bachelor exactly?

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,740
Right.

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,980
Well, a bachelor is a person who is not married, a single person, a single guy specifically,

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,980
right?

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,980
All right.

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,980
So it's a man.

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,980
Man.

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,980
Before he's married.

24
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,980
And a bachelorette.

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,300
Okay.

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,140
Bachelor is a guy and a bachelorette is a girl.

27
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,540
And so we don't really say bachelorette except when we're talking about this party.

28
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Right.

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,380
So a bachelor party is a party that a guy has the day before he's married or maybe two

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,260
or three days before he actually gets married.

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,520
So it's a night where all his friends get together, they go out, they have some drinks,

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,500
they have some fun and just like the last extreme fun they will have, he will have before

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
he gets married.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
All right.

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
And so it's all his guy friends.

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
All his guy friends.

37
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Only guys, no girls.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,220
And the bachelorette party is only girls and it's when a girl's friends take her out before

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,180
she gets married to celebrate her last night or two of being unmarried.

40
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,180
Right.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
Exactly.

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,940
So not only guys' parties can get a little bit crazy but girls' bachelorette parties can

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,340
also get kind of crazy, right?

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
That's true.

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,300
So before we start talking about what exactly goes on at some of these parties, let's take

46
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:06,740
a listen to today's dialogue and hear what happens to our main characters.

47
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,740
Hi honey.

48
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,180
You'll never guess what.

49
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,900
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Wow.

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
That's great news.

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,660
They're a great couple.

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,660
I know.

54
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,660
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,340
It's going to be so much fun.

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,180
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we're going to do that

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,500
night.

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,580
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,100
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your

60
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,620
friend's party.

61
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,420
Oh, come on.

62
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,280
It's just some innocent fun.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,580
You know how these things are.

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,340
We're going to play drinking games, get him some gag gifts and just have a good time.

65
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,940
Nothing too over the top.

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,340
Well, I don't know.

67
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Come on.

68
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,820
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to a bachelorette

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
party.

70
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:03,220
Good, because my friend Wendy's getting married and I'm organizing her party.

71
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,020
What?

72
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,980
All right, great.

73
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,140
So apparently both of them have parties to go to, but I don't think the guy was too happy

74
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
about it.

75
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,020
I don't think so either and that's the funny thing.

76
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,580
I think a lot of girls are like, oh, well, my husband-to-be, he wants to have a party.

77
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,580
It's okay.

78
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,940
But the minute the girl wants to have the party, the guy is like, uh-uh, no way.

79
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
That's true.

80
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,860
I guess, but we can talk a little bit more about this towards the end.

81
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,980
Before we start on this really interesting topic, why don't we take a look at some of

82
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,100
the language on Language Takeaway.

83
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,580
Language Takeaway.

84
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Well, Marco, the first few words are actually more wedding terms than bachelor party terms.

85
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,420
The first one is best man.

86
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Right, the best man.

87
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,500
So the best man is, who is he exactly?

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,480
He's usually the groom's best friend.

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,080
So the groom is the man getting married and his best friend has the position of best man.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,420
So he has some special things to do at the wedding.

91
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,740
He has to make a speech, for example, and he has to stand next to his friend when the

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,420
friend gets married.

93
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,180
And it's just a very special position of honor that the best friend has in his friend's wedding.

94
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,340
Okay, and among those responsibilities, the best man is usually the one that has to organize

95
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,460
the bachelor party, right?

96
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
Exactly.

97
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,260
Okay, so best man.

98
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,260
And well, the rest of the groom's friends are also present at the wedding and they are

99
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,260
called the groomsmen.

100
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,820
All right, so groom, groomsmen.

101
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,220
And so usually these are maybe three to five guys, three to five men who are friends of

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,180
the groom or brother of the bride.

103
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,060
It depends on the wedding.

104
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,900
And they stand with the man when he gets married.

105
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,420
And so they kind of have a lot of responsibilities as well.

106
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,420
Okay, and the groomsmen usually are also present at the bachelor party.

107
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Exactly.

108
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
All right.

109
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,540
Now moving on to a bit more colorful language.

110
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,740
We have a place here, a strip club.

111
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,900
Okay, so sometimes you see these in movies oftentimes or for example, the TV show The

112
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,940
Sopranos, this is often a place where Tony Soprano goes.

113
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:23,140
A strip club is a club, it's like a bar that's open most of the day and night where there

114
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,260
are women who take their clothes off for money.

115
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,700
All right, so you have the verb to strip, right?

116
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
A strip club.

117
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,220
So the verb to strip means to take off or leave without something.

118
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
Right.

119
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,420
So you can strip off your clothes.

120
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,940
So it's usually used with clothes, right?

121
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,780
To take off clothes, to strip.

122
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,540
So you have a strip club and in the strip club, you have the, as you mentioned, the

123
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,260
girls that are dancing and taking off their clothes, they are called strippers.

124
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,060
Okay, so stripper is a person who takes off their clothes as their job.

125
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,340
And you can have male strippers or female strippers.

126
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
True.

127
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,420
So usually just saying stripper is a woman and a male stripper is actually a guy.

128
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,660
So you have this club that's very common in many countries and well, the strippers are

129
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,340
dancing and now they also talked about getting a lap dance.

130
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,620
Okay, now this is getting a little bit, a little dirty.

131
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,660
Lap is a, well, it's not really a part of your body but when you sit down in a chair,

132
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,820
your lap is the tops of your legs.

133
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,020
So you can, you know, you can hold something in your lap like your backpack.

134
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,420
Or maybe for example, if you have a child that's three or four years old, you would

135
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,620
sit him on your lap, right, on your legs while you're sitting down maybe in subway.

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,260
Right, or a laptop computer is the kind of computer you can hold on your lap.

137
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,900
So a lap dance is when one of the female strippers comes and kind of dances on your lap.

138
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Exactly.

139
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,060
And so it's a sexy dance.

140
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,180
You pay for it extra and it's something that is very popular with young men and people

141
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,940
who, you know, these grooms and groomsmen before the groom gets married.

142
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,340
Right, alright.

143
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,300
And moving on, we have the last word for today, gag gifts.

144
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,220
Alright, gag gifts are joke gifts.

145
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,500
They're joke, they're meant to be funny, they're not meant to be serious.

146
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,780
And they're very popular at these kinds of bachelor parties and bachelorette parties.

147
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,940
One kind of gag gift that's just very silly is like a whoopee cushion.

148
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,780
You know, it's like a balloon you put on someone's seat and when they sit down, they make a farting

149
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
sound.

150
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Right.

151
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
So those are gag gifts.

152
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,780
And for to joke around, it's not really useful.

153
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,660
It's not like giving somebody a t-shirt, right?

154
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,980
Right, or a gift card is a nice gift.

155
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,140
It's not a gag gift.

156
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,140
Right.

157
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,500
So there are really, there are a lot of different types of gag gifts and actually some of them

158
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,700
are pretty good and funny like, you know, like spicy chewing gum or the electric shocker.

159
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,860
Oh, yeah.

160
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,180
When you shake somebody's hand.

161
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,060
That's really funny.

162
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,660
Alright, so we've taken a look at a lot of words on Language Takeaway.

163
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,780
So let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

164
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,860
Hi, honey.

165
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
You'll never guess what.

166
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,100
My friends, Julie and Alex, are getting married.

167
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
Wow, that's great news.

168
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,580
They're a great couple.

169
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
I know.

170
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.

171
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,260
It's gonna be so much fun.

172
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,740
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we're gonna do that

173
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
night.

174
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,460
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

175
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,980
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your

176
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,460
friend's party.

177
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,320
Ah, come on.

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,180
It's just some innocent fun.

179
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,980
You know how these things are.

180
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,260
We're gonna play drinking games, get him some gag gifts and just have a good time.

181
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,820
Nothing too over the top.

182
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,220
Well, I don't know.

183
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
Come on.

184
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,740
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette

185
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
party.

186
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,540
Good, because my friend Wendy's getting married and I'm organizing her party.

187
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
What?

188
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,180
All right, we're back.

189
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,180
So now, let's look at some of the phrases that were used in this dialogue on Fluency

190
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,620
Builder.

191
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Fluency Builder.

192
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,380
All right.

193
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:21,620
So at the beginning of this dialogue, we meet this couple, this man and woman.

194
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,420
And the guy says, hey, honey, you'll never guess what.

195
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
All right.

196
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Okay, my friends are getting married.

197
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,420
So what does this mean?

198
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,020
You'll never guess what.

199
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,740
It's just a phrase that you would use to give really, really important or exciting news.

200
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,900
It's like, guess what?

201
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,660
Okay, so you'll never guess what happened to me.

202
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,980
I won the lottery.

203
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,140
Right, it's so amazing or it's so uncommon or unusual that you would probably never guess

204
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,260
that person won the lottery.

205
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,020
Okay, so you'll never guess what.

206
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,340
Right, you'll never guess what.

207
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,660
Or you can say, guess what, I won the lottery.

208
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,020
Okay, all right.

209
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,260
And our second phrase, you know how these things are.

210
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,020
Okay, so this is a phrase that people often use when they want to remind someone that

211
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,500
this is tradition or this is a habit, it's a common thing.

212
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,740
And so oftentimes when like people are having problems at work and they say, oh, gosh, this

213
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,620
person's just not listening to me.

214
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,580
Someone to help them out will say, you know, you know how these things are.

215
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,420
You know, it takes some time to resolve a problem.

216
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,620
Or you could say, you know, gosh, this is gonna be a horrible party.

217
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,780
I don't want you guys to go to a strip club.

218
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
It's so dirty.

219
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Right.

220
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,100
And you'd say, well, you know how these things are.

221
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
It's tradition.

222
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
You have to do it.

223
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
You have to do it.

224
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,140
Right, so this is what he meant, right?

225
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
You know how these things are.

226
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,380
It's like, I don't really have a choice.

227
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,700
It's a tradition.

228
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,660
This is what guys do when they're gonna get married.

229
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,020
So we have to do it.

230
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,540
It's almost like saying, don't worry about it.

231
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
There's really nothing to worry about.

232
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,700
Nothing to worry about.

233
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
All right.

234
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,020
And our last phrase, and our last phrase is something that we'd never want to happen.

235
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,300
Something to be over the top.

236
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,460
Well, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

237
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Okay.

238
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,220
So we could say that it was a really ridiculous party.

239
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,660
It was really over the top.

240
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,140
They had a clown and they had people dressed up like Star Trek characters.

241
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,860
You know, something that is more than normal.

242
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,220
It's almost silly the way that it's all just kind of crazy.

243
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,900
And yeah, it's too much in every way.

244
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
Right.

245
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,820
So it can be something bad, like for example, someone's behavior was over the top.

246
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
It was too much.

247
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
It was too intense.

248
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,780
Or like, oh my gosh, did you see her coat?

249
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,060
It's really over the top.

250
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,220
It's like purple with sprinkles on it.

251
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Right.

252
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,100
So it can be used in different ways, but it usually means it's excessive.

253
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
It's too much.

254
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Exactly.

255
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
All right.

256
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,300
So some interesting phrases on this occasion as well.

257
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,820
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

258
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,300
Hi, honey.

259
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,820
You'll never guess what.

260
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,460
My friends Julie and Alex are getting married.

261
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Wow.

262
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,460
That's great news.

263
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,300
They're a great couple.

264
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
I know.

265
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.

266
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,980
It's going to be so much fun.

267
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,500
All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we're going to do

268
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
that night.

269
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,220
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?

270
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,740
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your

271
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,220
friend's party.

272
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,060
Oh, come on.

273
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,920
It's just some innocent fun.

274
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,740
You know how these things are.

275
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,020
We're going to play drinking games, get them some gag gifts and just have a good time.

276
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,460
Nothing too over the top.

277
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,940
Well, I don't know.

278
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Come on.

279
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,220
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to a bachelorette

280
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,540
party.

281
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:46,100
Good, because my friend Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party.

282
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,500
What?

283
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:56,140
All right, we're back.

284
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,940
So bachelor and bachelorette parties.

285
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,780
Have you ever been to a bachelorette party?

286
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,060
I have not yet, but one of my closest friends is getting married in a couple of weeks, and

287
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,020
so I will be attending and helping organize a bachelorette party.

288
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,860
So do you have anything in mind?

289
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,540
Nothing I can talk about.

290
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,660
These things are meant to be surprises oftentimes, so I don't want to spoil it.

291
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,220
But I will tell you that my boyfriend just organized a bachelorette party for his best

292
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
friend.

293
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,380
He was the best man in the wedding.

294
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,460
And it was very crazy.

295
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,420
Did they also go to Vegas and do some of these things that we saw in the dialogue?

296
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,700
They didn't go to Vegas, but they did some of the things we heard about in today's dialogue.

297
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,540
They went to a strip club, they got lap dances, they drank a lot.

298
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,460
It was very over the top.

299
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,100
And I think this is something that most of our listeners probably have seen in TV shows

300
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,860
or in movies or in different type of exposure of American culture, which is actually very,

301
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,180
very common in Canada, the United States.

302
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,220
I'm not really sure about Europe or England.

303
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
It is too.

304
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Really?

305
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,900
My friend said that his friend was getting married and they all went to Portugal for

306
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,380
a week to have a bachelor party.

307
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,500
And I heard something about mud wrestling.

308
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Wow.

309
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,020
Well, I guess it's different in every country.

310
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,020
And this is the interesting part.

311
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,460
We want to know how these things are in your country.

312
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,700
Do you have any traditions or any fun stuff that you do before the wedding?

313
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Maybe after?

314
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
I don't know.

315
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
What about Ecuador?

316
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,500
We usually, we don't really have strip clubs actually.

317
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
So it's kind of...

318
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
That makes it easy.

319
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Yeah.

320
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,340
So we usually just do what we do every night.

321
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,380
Just go out with friends, drink and dance, play the guitar or yeah, maybe some gag gifts

322
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,340
or some prank that we pull on the groom, but nothing too over the top.

323
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,620
So yeah, we're really interested in knowing how it is in your country.

324
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,180
So come to EnglishPod.com, leave your questions, comments and we'll see you guys next time.

325
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
Until then, bye everyone.

326
00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:22,180
Bye bye.
