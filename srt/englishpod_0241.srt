00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we've got part three of an exciting series we've got for

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,960
you at the elementary level.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
That's right.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,200
As you may remember, this is a series that we're studying all about a job interview.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,360
So in the first part, we just talked about the introduction.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,920
The second part was talking about your personal background and now we're going to talk about

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,680
your educational background.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,640
Okay, so the key topic here today is education.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:40,280
Let's take a listen to this dialogue and we'll be back in a minute.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,080
Now if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,520
Yes, that's right.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,120
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,880
My major was English and my minor was business.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,200
I completed my BA in 2004.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,720
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,360
Yes, that's right.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,200
I've always enjoyed studying.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,840
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,640
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,880
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,800
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,160
newspaper, which I really loved.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,800
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,200
What did that involve?

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,920
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,440
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm sure.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,800
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah, okay.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Okay.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,040
Alright, we're back.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,720
So, the girl was talking about her education, about her university, and she talked about

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,560
some very interesting words.

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,520
So why don't we take a look at those in Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Language Takeaway.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,520
So, at the very beginning, Mr. Parsons, who's the interviewer here, asks Rebecca about her

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,480
background and says, I see that you completed your BA in English.

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,040
Okay, so we have an acronym there.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
Okay, BA.

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,800
This stands for bachelors, or usually a four-year degree at the beginning of your university

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
studies.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
That's right.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,440
So, it's a type of degree, right?

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,960
A BA is, as you say, your bachelor's degree, and it usually takes four years.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
That's right.

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,400
You have a Bachelor of the Arts, BA, but you also have a Bachelor of Science, which is

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
a BS.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,920
So, as you can tell, one is for the arts, like art history, music, things like that.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,320
The other is for sciences, like physics or chemistry.

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Very good.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Alright, so she has a BA in English, so she obviously studied the English language in

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
university.

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,040
Then she moved on to talk about her major and minor.

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
That's right.

57
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,080
So, as you know, a degree is not just a degree in the arts in general, but it usually has

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,840
a focus or an area of focus.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,420
So her area of focus, her major, was English.

60
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
This is the most important part of her studies.

61
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,800
So many of her courses, most of her courses at university were in English.

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,680
That's right, but she also has a minor in business studies.

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Okay, that means she also studied business and business studies.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,560
That's not as important as her English studies, but it was very much a part of her degree.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,440
So let's say that when she was studying in university, 70% of what she studied was related

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,400
to her major, English, and maybe 30% was her minor was business studies.

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
That's right.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,960
And she goes on to talk about herself and her friends who describe her as a bookworm.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
This is a really nice adjective and very common in English.

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
That's right.

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,000
So if you are a bookworm or you describe yourself as a bookworm, it means that you like to study

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
a lot.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
You like to read a lot of books.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,440
So bookworm is just like what you said, is someone who really likes to read, someone

75
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,520
who's always reading, maybe someone who lives in the library.

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
So that's why you call them a bookworm.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,800
They live in the library or they read a lot of books.

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,360
All right, so that's the noun bookworm.

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,880
Now moving on to other parts of university.

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,760
When you're studying, you're not only studying English or sciences and things like that.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,400
Sometimes you also do other activities or other things.

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
That's right.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,560
So you have your schoolwork, which is during school, it's English and business studies

84
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
for this woman, Rebecca.

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,080
But you also have what you do outside of school.

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,280
This is called extracurricular activities.

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,040
So that's a long word, extracurricular.

88
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
That's right.

89
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,120
So extracurricular means it's not in the curriculum, right?

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
That's right.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,260
It's outside of school.

92
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,340
So it's not really like a specific subject or something that's related to your studies.

93
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,960
If you don't do extracurricular activities, it's okay, right?

94
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,240
That's right, a lot of people don't do any extracurricular activities, but many people

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
do.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
For example, writing for the school newspaper or playing soccer.

97
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Exactly.

98
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
So those are extracurricular activities.

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,840
Anything that you want to do in university apart from studying, playing soccer, writing,

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
etc.

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,320
And it's not just university.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,080
You can do these in high school as well.

103
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,760
Okay, very good.

104
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,240
So those are the words that we have picked out for you today.

105
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
I think they're very specific to education and I think we should go back, listen to the

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,240
dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Now if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,480
Yes, that's right.

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,100
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

110
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,840
My major was English and my minor was business.

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,120
I completed my BA in 2004.

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
Yes, that's right.

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,160
I've always enjoyed studying.

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

117
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,800
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,760
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student

119
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,040
newspaper, which I really loved.

120
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,760
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

121
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,480
What did that involve?

122
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,800
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

124
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm sure.

125
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,640
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

126
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,240
Yeah, okay.

127
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Okay.

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,760
All right, we're back.

129
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,640
So now let's start off with our first phrase on Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Fluency Builder.

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,680
So Rebecca's talking about her father and her friends, and she says she's a bookworm,

132
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,680
but her father always pushed us, that means her and her family members, her siblings,

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
to succeed.

134
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,680
And this verb, to push us, to push someone, is very important because it's not the same

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
as like to push a door.

136
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Right.

137
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,680
It's not physically that you're pushing somebody.

138
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,800
It's actually to motivate somebody or to inspire someone to become better at something.

139
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
That's right.

140
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
So to push someone is to encourage them to do something bad.

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,680
It's not always a good thing.

142
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,520
So she was always pushing me to do what she wanted to do, not what I wanted to do.

143
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,680
That means someone's always trying to influence you or to get you to do something.

144
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Exactly.

145
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,880
So as you say, to push someone is to influence them, to motivate them, to encourage them

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,160
to do something good or bad.

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Well, and Mr. Parsons agreed with her dad's encouragement and he said, well, it really

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
paid off.

149
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Okay.

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,880
This is a great verbal phrase, to pay off.

151
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,400
This means to have benefits.

152
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Okay.

153
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,980
So all of your hard work really paid off.

154
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,520
So you can see the results.

155
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,660
You can see the positive results of your hard work.

156
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
It paid off.

157
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,720
You could even ask someone, all that hard work, did it pay off?

158
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Right.

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
So that you're basically asking, was it worth it?

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Yeah.

161
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Okay.

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
To pay off.

163
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,080
And well, when she was talking about extracurricular activities, she said she was always keen on

164
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
writing.

165
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,520
Now, I think this is more common among British people to say you're keen on something, but

166
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,800
it basically means to like.

167
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,560
So remember the phrase keen on.

168
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,280
This is the preposition here, keen on.

169
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,820
I'm keen on writing.

170
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,440
So can you say that you are keen on someone?

171
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Yes, you can.

172
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,560
That means you like someone, maybe romantically.

173
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Okay.

174
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,440
So it's kind of, as Catherine said, more of a British thing, but it's correct and you

175
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,400
can use it in replacement of to like.

176
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,520
I think it also sounds a little bit more formal.

177
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Instead of saying, well, I've always liked writing.

178
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,840
If she says, well, I've always been keen on writing, I think it sounds nice.

179
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
A little smarter.

180
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Yeah.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
All right.

182
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,340
And our last word.

183
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,020
It's actually an interesting word.

184
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:13,320
It might be a little bit complicated to understand, but when she said that volunteering was very

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,920
fulfilling and to be part of a group.

186
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Okay.

187
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Fulfilling sounds a lot like the word filling, but you shouldn't confuse these two because

188
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
the meaning is very different, right?

189
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,960
So something that is fulfilling makes you feel really good.

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,240
Maybe you don't make money from it or you don't get a lot of praise from it, but it

191
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,560
still makes you feel happy about life for yourself or something.

192
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,200
So you get satisfaction.

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Now notice the pronunciation.

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
You don't say full filling.

195
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
No, you say fulfilling.

196
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Fulfilling.

197
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,160
So the L there is kind of silent.

198
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,680
Kind of optional.

199
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,360
But maybe you could ask someone, what do you find fulfilling in your life?

200
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,080
Or you can ask, do you think your job is fulfilling?

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Yeah.

202
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Okay.

203
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
So a lot of great words there.

204
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,400
A lot of interesting things related to education and not so much.

205
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:10,560
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,320
Now if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

207
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,800
Yes, that's right.

208
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,400
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

209
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,160
My major was English and my minor was business.

210
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,400
I completed my BA in 2004.

211
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,640
Yes, that's right.

213
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
I've always enjoyed studying.

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,120
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

215
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,920
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

216
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,160
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

217
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,080
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,440
newspaper, which I really loved.

219
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,040
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

220
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,760
What did that involve?

221
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,160
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

222
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,680
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
I'm sure.

224
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,040
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

225
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Yeah, okay.

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Okay.

227
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:24,560
All right, so talking about going to university, I think they used a really specific verb there

228
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,960
that's worth mentioning.

229
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,960
She said, I attended York University in the UK.

230
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,480
So to attend.

231
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
That's right.

232
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,960
So you can say, I studied at York University, but the more formal way of saying that I was

233
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,560
a student at York University is to say, I attended that school.

234
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,440
So to attend means to be a student at that place.

235
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Okay.

236
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
And what about you, Catherine?

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,480
Did you participate in any extracurricular activities back in college?

238
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
I did.

239
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,720
I participated in a lot of extracurricular activities.

240
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:03,880
I was in the orchestra at my university and I played in a lot of musical groups.

241
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:11,560
I also was in a discussion group for politics and the India-Pakistan dialogue group.

242
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,480
And I was in a number of different film clubs.

243
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,160
So we would talk about film and I even helped out at the TV station for my university.

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Oh, wow.

245
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,320
The university had a TV station.

246
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Yeah.

247
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
So all of it was student directed.

248
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,200
So basically the students controlled the TV station.

249
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
That's really interesting.

250
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,600
I think these types of extracurricular activities are as many as these are maybe not as common

251
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
in other places, or maybe they're a little bit different.

252
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,160
I know, for example, in the US you have all these political ones and a lot of sports and

253
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,120
things like that, but you also have very strange far ones.

254
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Like I don't know, like there's a cooking club and there's even like a gardening club.

255
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
Astronomy club.

256
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Astronomy club.

257
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,680
There's all types of extracurricular activities.

258
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,840
Well, what's really nice about a lot of American universities is that there are many, many

259
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,960
resources that students can use.

260
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,560
And so maybe the reason there's a cooking club is because there are massive kitchens

261
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,400
the students can use to cook food and experiment and even teachers and professors sometimes

262
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
come to help.

263
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,120
So it's a really nice environment because everyone's teaching each other.

264
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Right.

265
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,300
No, it's very, very interesting.

266
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,600
We're actually curious to know how universities work in your country.

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,320
Are you able to have a minor in a subject?

268
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,200
Because many universities don't offer this option.

269
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Right.

270
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,440
They just have one major and that's all.

271
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Right.

272
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,220
Or maybe are you able to participate in extracurricular activities?

273
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,320
Like sports or radio or writing.

274
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Let us know.

275
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

276
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
All right.

277
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
So we'll see you guys there.

278
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Bye.

279
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:58,800
Bye.
