00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,980
And my name is Catherine, and we've got a great lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,440
What level is this, Marco?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,200
This is an elementary lesson, and we're going to be touching one of these medical topics.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,120
Today we're going to talk about chickenpox.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,440
Oh, gosh, I hated the chickenpox.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,680
They're horrible, and they itch, and you can't do anything about it, and your parents say,

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
don't scratch.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
Right.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,440
So chickenpox is an illness that you get usually as a child, and what happens is you start

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,280
getting these little red dots all over your body, like little mosquito bites.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,720
Exactly, and they come all over your body, arms, legs, face, and you can only get this

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,880
disease once, unless maybe you didn't really get it too seriously.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,840
So most people get this when they're children.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,240
Exactly, and what makes you very uncomfortable when you get chickenpox, as you said, it's

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,120
these little red dots, they itch, just like mosquito bites, but you can't scratch because

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,720
if you do, then your skin gets like marked, right?

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
You have like stains.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Forever.

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
Forever, like scars.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,840
So it's best not to scratch, and that's what we're going to talk about today.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,740
Somebody has the chickenpox.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:27,600
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll be right back.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Why are you scratching so much?

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I feel itchy.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
I can't stand it anymore.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I think I may be coming down with something.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I feel lightheaded and weak.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Let me have a look.

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Whoa, get away from me.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
What's wrong?

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I think you have chickenpox.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I don't know.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I think I have chickenpox.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
I don't know.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I think I have chickenpox.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I don't know.

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I think I have chickenpox.

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I don't know.

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I think I have chickenpox.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I think I have chickenpox.

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
I'm going to watch it.

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,320
I'm really curious.

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,740
What's that on your hand?

47
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,480
I forget it's golden.

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
I think it's golden.

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm getting stiffer and stiffer.

50
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,220
Stiff?

51
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm really going to get the chicken or chickenpox.

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,740
I don't know, it's not chicken or things.

53
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,660
What is it, it's like...

54
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,820
Alright, we're back, so I think this kid does have the chicken pox.

55
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,980
Definitely, and well, he's got a funny solution for it.

56
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,020
But before we get there, we've got a lot of great medical words and just basic body words

57
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,660
for you in today's Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,660
Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,840
Alright, so let's start with our first word.

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,900
He mentioned that he felt itchy.

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,140
I feel itchy.

62
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Itchy.

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,380
Okay, this is often confused even among children who are native speakers of English.

64
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,860
There are two words, to itch and to scratch.

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,860
But this person is itchy, so it means that your skin, you want to scratch it.

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,180
It's maybe uncomfortable.

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,700
Like a mosquito bite is itchy.

68
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,100
Okay, so itchy would be the adjective, right?

69
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,740
To the noun, an itch.

70
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,740
So if you have an itch, you feel itchy, right?

71
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Exactly.

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,220
So, and that's when you scratch.

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,860
Alright so he feels itchy and he also felt a little bit lightheaded.

74
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,620
Okay, so you know the word head, you know the word light.

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,020
So here we have a person who feels lightheaded.

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:28,420
It means that you kind of feel a little bit strange and your head is a little bit, well,

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,020
what's a good word to describe it?

78
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Like dizzy.

79
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,700
Yeah, almost dizzy or faint.

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Right.

81
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,780
So, you usually feel a little bit weak.

82
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,860
You don't really feel very well.

83
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,460
Your head is lightheaded.

84
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,580
The complete opposite of having a headache, right?

85
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Exactly.

86
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,500
Okay, and well then the girl got scared and she said, get away, you are contagious.

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,460
Oh gosh, now this is a dangerous one.

88
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,120
Someone who is contagious can pass their illness to someone else.

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,540
So for example, the flu is very contagious and if I have the flu, Marco doesn't want

90
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,740
me to, you know, come over and touch all of his stuff and sneeze and cough into his food.

91
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,860
Right, exactly.

92
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
So that's contagious.

93
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,540
It's an adjective and that means that you easily pass your illness to another person.

94
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Exactly.

95
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,180
Alright, so why don't we take a look at a couple of different examples using this word

96
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,260
contagious.

97
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,860
Example one.

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Don't get near me.

99
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,700
Chicken pox are very contagious.

100
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,100
Example two.

101
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,380
The sickness that is going around the office is very contagious.

102
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,380
Example three.

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,820
H1N1 flu is very contagious.

104
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,540
Alright, so you want to avoid contagious people but you might also want to avoid people who

105
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,700
have this next word.

106
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,340
It's called a rash.

107
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,860
A rash, exactly.

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,180
So why do you want to avoid people who have a rash?

109
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,500
They might have a contagious rash.

110
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,820
Who knows but you can get a rash for a number of different reasons.

111
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,260
A rash is just basically a part of your skin that becomes irritated or uncomfortable and

112
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,580
sometimes it turns red or pink.

113
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Exactly.

114
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,500
So, as you said, it happens for different reasons.

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,580
Sometimes you maybe have bad seafood in your skin and you start to have rashes all over

116
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,660
your body.

117
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,340
Other times you can touch some plants that are dangerous like poison ivy or poison oak.

118
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,300
And then you get a big rash.

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,060
And our last word for today is a little bit dramatic.

120
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,100
She called him a biohazard.

121
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Biohazard.

122
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,020
Well, let's take a look at these words individually.

123
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,900
The first word bio comes from the word biology.

124
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
So that's something that is alive.

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,180
An animal, a plant or a person.

126
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,900
And hazard is something that is dangerous.

127
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,180
So a biohazard is a, well, something that's alive that's dangerous.

128
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
Right.

129
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,220
Something that's dangerous towards a living person, right, or organism.

130
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,740
For example, you don't want to be near an area that has a lot of radiation.

131
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
It's a biohazard.

132
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Exactly.

133
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,300
Or some of these diseases like Ebola virus.

134
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,580
These are very dangerous towards living things.

135
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,420
And so biohazard is the name for it.

136
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Exactly.

137
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,460
And usually there's a symbol, a very clear symbol that kind of looks like a triangle

138
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,140
and it's red.

139
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,180
And even in movies it's appeared, right?

140
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
I think in that movie.

141
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
Yeah.

142
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
It's red or yellow.

143
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Yeah, sometimes.

144
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
All right.

145
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
So biohazard.

146
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,740
I think we've taken a look at a lot of words.

147
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,980
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again?

148
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,720
Let's slow it down a little bit.

149
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,140
See if we can understand a little bit more.

150
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,740
What's wrong with you?

151
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,700
Why are you scratching so much?

152
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,660
I feel itchy.

153
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,300
I can't stand it anymore.

154
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,420
I think I may be coming down with something.

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,460
I feel lightheaded and weak.

156
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,420
Let me have a look.

157
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,620
Whoa.

158
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Get away from me.

159
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,580
What's wrong?

160
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,340
I think you have the chicken pox.

161
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,100
You're contagious.

162
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,340
Get away.

163
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
Don't breathe on me.

164
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,540
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy.

165
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,420
We can't be sure until I see a doctor.

166
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,700
Well, in the meantime, you are a biohazard.

167
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,740
I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it

168
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,260
as an adult.

169
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,780
Are you serious?

170
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,380
You always blow things out of proportion.

171
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,460
In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

172
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,900
Eww.

173
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,180
All right.

174
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
We're back.

175
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,380
Why don't we take a look at Fluency Builder and start taking a look at all these phrases.

176
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Fluency Builder.

177
00:07:53,380 --> 00:08:00,060
Well, the first one is something that we often say when we're starting to feel ill.

178
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,220
This phrase is coming down with.

179
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,220
So I could say, I think I'm coming down with a cold, for example.

180
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,660
So basically, you say, I'm coming down with something.

181
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,180
So a cold or I think I'm coming down with the flu.

182
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,780
So you're saying that I think I'm getting ill?

183
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Exactly.

184
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,420
It means I'm just starting to feel sick.

185
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,420
And so you could say, I've had a cold for a week.

186
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,220
You wouldn't use the phrase I'm coming down with in this situation.

187
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,260
You'd only use it when you're starting to feel sick.

188
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Very good.

189
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,980
So you could ask your boss, I think I'm coming down with the flu.

190
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,860
Can I go home early?

191
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,040
Right.

192
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,220
And I think this is a very useful phrase.

193
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,860
It's very natural to say.

194
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,740
So why don't we listen to a couple of other examples?

195
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,980
Example one.

196
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,780
Honey will you take my temperature?

197
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,500
I think I'm coming down with something.

198
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,580
Example two.

199
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,700
You must be coming down with a cold.

200
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,380
Example three.

201
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,100
Tommy came down with the flu.

202
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
All right.

203
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,460
So coming down with, coming down with the flu, coming down with a cough, etc.

204
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
All right.

205
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
What's our next phrase?

206
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Well, this one's great.

207
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,980
It's a filler phrase.

208
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,660
So in the meantime.

209
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,420
In the meantime.

210
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,580
So I could say, all right, I'm going to go cook dinner.

211
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,620
In the meantime, Marco, can you please clear the table?

212
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Okay.

213
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,980
So while you are cooking dinner, I am doing something else.

214
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
I'm cleaning the table.

215
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,540
So two things happening at the same time.

216
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
In the meantime.

217
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Very good.

218
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,020
So it's a filler, you say.

219
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,860
Because usually it follows another phrase.

220
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,180
So I'm going to be doing this report for a while.

221
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,300
In the meantime, can you just wait here on the sofa, please?

222
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Okay.

223
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Very good.

224
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
So in the meantime.

225
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,380
So you're connecting two different actions, two different ideas.

226
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
Exactly.

227
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,380
Very good.

228
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,380
In the meantime.

229
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,020
And what about our last phrase?

230
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,500
All right.

231
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,060
There are some people who really like to do this.

232
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,780
And I might be one of them.

233
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,180
It's called to blow things out of proportion.

234
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
All right.

235
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,820
And you're going to hear this phrase a lot with native English speakers.

236
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,420
And so to blow things out of proportion, well, it pretty much means that you're exaggerating

237
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,340
or you're making a really big deal out of something that's not very serious.

238
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,300
So for example, if you come over to my house and you break a glass and I start freaking

239
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,460
out and yelling at you because you broke my glass.

240
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,180
I say, Marco, you're blowing things out of proportion.

241
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,340
I'll just buy you a new one.

242
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
It's not that serious.

243
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
All right.

244
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,340
So don't exaggerate.

245
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Right.

246
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Right.

247
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:44,340
And you can say like this with siblings, spouses or bosses who react very seriously.

248
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,540
So you can say, hey, stop.

249
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,100
Stop yelling like you're blowing things out of proportion.

250
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,620
This is not a really big deal.

251
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Exactly.

252
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,620
All right.

253
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,340
So blowing things out of proportion.

254
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
Let's not do that.

255
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:08,060
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll be back.

256
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,060
What's wrong with you?

257
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Why are you scratching so much?

258
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
I feel itchy.

259
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
I can't stand it anymore.

260
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
I think I may be coming down with something.

261
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
I feel lightheaded and weak.

262
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Let me have a look.

263
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Whoa, get away from me.

264
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
What's wrong?

265
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I think you have chicken pox.

266
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:28,340
You're contagious.

267
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Get away.

268
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Don't breathe on me.

269
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,420
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy.

270
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,540
We can't be sure until I see a doctor.

271
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,460
Well, in the meantime, you're a biohazard.

272
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,260
I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it

273
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
as an adult.

274
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Are you serious?

275
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,700
You always blow things out of proportion.

276
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,740
In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

277
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
Eww.

278
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,460
All right.

279
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,940
So Catherine, have you ever had the chicken pox?

280
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
I did.

281
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,780
I have very, very clear memories of when I was a child and I had the chicken pox because

282
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,620
I believe it was Thanksgiving and I was about four or five years old.

283
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,660
And I didn't have an appetite, so I was not hungry.

284
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,540
And all I could do was itch and drink.

285
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,860
And so I still have little scars like you mentioned from where I couldn't stop myself

286
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,100
from scratching my little marks.

287
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Right.

288
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,620
And well, why does the little boy say that he's going to go take an oatmeal bath?

289
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
An oatmeal bath.

290
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Okay.

291
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,300
Well, this is one of the home remedies, one of the home cures for the itchiness.

292
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,340
All right.

293
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,940
So it doesn't make your chicken pox go away, but it does make your skin feel better because

294
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,620
it's very calming and smooth.

295
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,780
So you can have some creams or some lotions, but other people like to take an oatmeal bath.

296
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
Right.

297
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,140
So then you're not itching anymore.

298
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Right.

299
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,980
But it's gross because you're sitting in oatmeal.

300
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
It is kind of gross.

301
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,300
Have you had the chicken pox?

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,100
I didn't know because I couldn't remember.

303
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,420
So actually my brother had it recently, so I was afraid that I didn't get it, but I called

304
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
my mom.

305
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,820
She said I got it, so I'm good.

306
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
You're safe.

307
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Yeah.

308
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
So that's the thing, right?

309
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
You can only get it once.

310
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,620
You don't have a problem.

311
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,260
Well, we're curious to know, have you had the chicken pox?

312
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,100
And if you did, was it really itchy or were you a lucky one and it wasn't so bad?

313
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,140
So let us know on our website, englishpod.com.

314
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Right.

315
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,740
And if you ever had any other common childhood illnesses like the mumps or the measles, right,

316
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,640
you can also tell us about that.

317
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,820
So we'll see you guys there and until next time.

318
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Bye everyone.

319
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:49,760
Enter a culture in which a child lives above the parents by invoking a parenting image

320
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,720
of their childhood.

321
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:04,680
So the clan really started out by messing around with the cards they thought about
