00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,160
My name is Kathryn and we have a very fun lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
That's right.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,700
We're going to talk about toys.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,560
So we're going to actually take a look at a lot of different types of toys and we're

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,660
going to be listening to a couple of commercials.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,660
That's right.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,880
So we've got two children who are watching TV and they're listening to a number of different

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,100
commercials.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,880
So we're going to learn about some of these very popular products in a moment.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Let's first listen to our dialogue.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Spongebob Squarepants will be right back after these brief messages.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
What's that on the horizon?

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
A pirate ship.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Raid villages and find buried treasure with these new pirates Lego set.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Build the ship and decide who rules the sea.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Har!

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200

Wow mommy!

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Can I get that for my birthday?

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,920
Wolverine, Jean Grey, Rogue and Professor X.

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,400
Collect all four of these special edition collectible X-Men action figures and decide

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,520
the future of the mutants in our world.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
No way!

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
I want Professor X!

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,520
The new collector's edition nursery rhymes porcelain dolls.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Little Bo Peep comes with her own shape and staff.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Oh!

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
She's pretty!

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I've never had a porcelain doll before.

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,960
I doubt mom and dad will get you that for your birthday.

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
She costs a pretty penny.

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,480
Plus you'd most likely break her.

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
What is better than a board?

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
What is better than one board game?

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Three board games in one!

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Enjoy playing chess and checkers on this side of the board.

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:04,480
But if you're looking for some more fun, flip it and play the classic game of sorry.

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
That's ingenious!

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,480
Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Now you can take SpongeBob SquarePants wherever you go with the new SpongeBob SquarePants

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,320
glow in the dark yo-yo.

51
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:23,600
And now, back to our show.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Alright we're back.

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,240
So a lot of great toys and actually it's very popular that while maybe you're watching cartoons,

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,480
you get a lot of these commercials that are selling you all types of toys.

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,880
Absolutely, because normally children watch cartoons and children like toys.

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,640
So it makes sense.

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Exactly.

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:49,680
So why don't we take a look at six key words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
Language Takeaway.

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay Marco, so what's the first word we're looking at here today?

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,760
Alright, we have actually a brand, a very famous type of toy.

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,160
They're called Legos.

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Legos.

64
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,440
So Lego, Legos.

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,080
So Legos are basically little pieces that you put together to build things.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah, they're like little blocks.

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
Okay, so when you see them, they don't look like anything.

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
But as a child, you get to create anything you want.

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,960
So Legos have become very famous.

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,520
They have like special types that you can recreate maybe a spaceship from Star Wars,

71
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,120
a pirate ship, a lot of different types now.

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,460
Okay, so the one in today's commercial is Pirate Legos.

73
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,440
So they're building a pirate ship.

74
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,280
Exactly, Legos.

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Alright and the next toy that we have is also a proper noun.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,800
It's a brand and it's called Play-Doh.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Play-Doh.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Okay, so play like playing with something, playing basketball.

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
But Play-Doh is...

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,920
It's like clay, right?

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,060
It's like clay, but it's made out of flour I think and you can shape it into anything

82
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
you want.

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,720
So when I was little, I used to make Play-Doh animals.

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,120
You know, you could make a ball and you make another ball and all of a sudden you have

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
a cow.

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Right.

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,520
So it's a very soft texture type of a material that you can mold.

88
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,680
You can give it different shapes and that's what we call Play-Doh.

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
Obviously, as you say, it's safe for children.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,680
I think it's made out of some flour.

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,040
Salt and flour.

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,400
And I think a lot of children sometimes eat this.

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,440
So it's pretty safe for kids.

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Right.

95
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,520
So yeah, that's Play-Doh.

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,420
It's a proper noun and I guess everyone just calls it Play-Doh.

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,580
So this is the toy that we're talking about.

98
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,040
Now moving on, we're talking about the X-Men.

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,960
Wolverine, Jean Grey, Rogue, Professor X, and all of these come in little statues that

100
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,440
we call action figures.

101
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
All right.

102
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,600
So what you're talking about here are obviously the X-Men, Marco.

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
And X-Men, there are many different kinds of X-Men.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,240
You have, like you said, Wolverine, who's maybe one of the most famous and Rogue.

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,160
But when you collect these little statues, these little dolls, they're called action

106
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
figures.

107
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,520
So figure is like a kind of doll.

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Right.

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
So the X-Men is just an example.

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,920
You have action figures of all sorts of cartoons or movies.

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Star Wars action figures are very popular.

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Or G.I.

113
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,880
Joe action figures are very popular as well.

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
That's right.

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,440
So they're little toy statues that children play with.

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
All right.

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,920
Moving on, now we have an adjective, a way to describe the X-Men.

118
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
That's right.

119
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,760
X-Men, as you know, are not normal people.

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,360
They have special powers.

121
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,000
Some X-Men can fly.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,080
Wolverine has animal abilities.

123
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,440
He can use his long claws.

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,860
So these are mutants.

125
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,000
That means that they were humans, but something changed in them and it makes them have these

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
special powers.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OK.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,240
So a mutant is maybe a person that has special powers, like as you say, Wolverine and all

129
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,840
these types of X-Men.

130
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,880
But I guess to, taking maybe a look at the verb mutate, that means...

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
To change.

132
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
To change, right?

133
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
OK.

134
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
So to mutate is to change.

135
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,600
So we could say, I found a frog that had three legs.

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
OK.

137
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,320
So it clearly mutated because normally frogs have like four legs.

138
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Exactly.

139
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,160
You see that sometimes with chickens that maybe have two heads or something like this.

140
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
These are mutants.

141
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
OK.

142
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
They have mutated.

143
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
OK.

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
So that's a mutation.

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,520
And now moving on to our dolls.

146
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,080
They were talking about these beautiful porcelain dolls.

147
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
OK.

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,280
So let's talk about porcelain because I think everyone knows what a doll is.

149
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,600
But porcelain is a special kind of doll, right?

150
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Right.

151
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
It's a material.

152
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,760
And usually you can find this material very commonly in your plates.

153
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
All right.

154
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,040
So it's not clear.

155
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
It's not glass.

156
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
No.

157
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
It's colored.

158
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,760
It's normally whitish and very, very fine, very pretty.

159
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
So you call it porcelain.

160
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,800
I guess it's a type of ceramic, right?

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
That's right.

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
OK.

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,960
So yeah, you have porcelain dolls.

164
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,520
Many people also have very fine china that you call it, like dinner plates.

165
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Or teacups.

166
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Or teacups.

167
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,080
And those are usually made of porcelain.

168
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,680
All right.

169
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,640
And finally, they were talking about a game that has three games in one.

170
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,720
And one of the kids said, wow, that's ingenious.

171
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Ingenious.

172
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
This is a great word.

173
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
Makes you sound really fluent.

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,480
So ingenious basically means clever.

175
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Right.

176
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
It's a really good idea.

177
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,880
It's a very clever, good idea.

178
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
So if something is ingenious, it's just, wow, it's very creative.

179
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,360
For example, I have a pair of gloves, but on the fingers, sometimes I can pull a cover

180
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,000
over them and they turn into mittens.

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think it's ingenious.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,720
You have gloves and mittens.

183
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,200
I have gloves and mittens all the time.

184
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
All right.

185
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,920
So a lot of interesting words there.

186
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,720
A lot of specific toys and particularly brands that you may or may not know.

187
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,280
But why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Builder.

189
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,000
Spongebob Squarepants will be right back after these brief messages.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's that on the horizon?

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,880
A pirate ship.

192
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,640
Raid villages and find buried treasure with this new pirate's Lego set.

193
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,320
Build the ship and decide who rules the sea.

194
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Arr.

195
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
Cool.

196
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,560

197
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,240

199
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Treasure chest sold separately.

200
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,240
Wow, mommy, can I get that for my birthday?

201
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,560
Wolverine, Jean Grey, Rogue, and Professor X.

202
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,080
Collect all four of these special edition collectible X-Men action figures and decide

203
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
the future of the mutants in our world.

204
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
No way!

205
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,520
I want Professor X!

206
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,160
The new Collector's Edition Nursery Rhymes Porcelain Dolls.

207
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,280
Little Bo Peep comes with her own sheep and staff.

208
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,200
Her clothes are made with the finest fabrics and real Italian lace.

209
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,160
And her face has been hand painted by our finest artists.

210
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Only $199.

211
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,920
Ooh, she's pretty.

212
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,720
I've never had a porcelain doll before.

213
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,000
I doubt mom and dad will get you that for your birthday.

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,360
She costs a pretty penny.

215
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,880
Plus, you'd most likely break her.

216
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,680
What is better than a board?

217
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
What is better than one board game?

218
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
Three board games in one!

219
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,520
Enjoy playing chess and checkers on this side of the board.

220
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,240
But if you're looking for some more fun, flip it and play the classic game of Sorry.

221
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,000
That's ingenious!

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,140
Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?

223
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,840
Now you can take SpongeBob SquarePants wherever you go with the new SpongeBob SquarePants

224
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
Glow in the Dark Yo-Yo.

225
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,640
And now, back to our show.

226
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,680
Okay, so the first phrase here in Fluency Builder is a really important one for anyone

227
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,920
who's buying anything because you often see this phrase on packages or you hear it in

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
commercials.

229
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Right.

230
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,360
As you saw in the Play-Doh commercial, the guy said, treasure chest sold separately.

231
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay, sold separately.

232
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,720
That means the treasure chest is not included.

233
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,160
You have to buy it extra.

234
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
As you say, you usually see it in packaging as well.

235
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,680
Maybe you buy a toy car and at the bottom it will say, batteries sold separately.

236
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,940
That means there are no batteries in the box.

237
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,320
You have to buy batteries extra.

238
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Exactly.

239
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,780
So that's what the phrase sold separately means.

240
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,480
It indicates that it's not included in the product that you are buying.

241
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,840
Alright now moving on again to the action figures and the dolls.

242
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,920
We saw this very interesting way of describing them.

243
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,840
For example, the action figure said, special edition collectible X-Men action figures.

244
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,360
Okay, special edition.

245
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,240
This is really important and it's very common I think with special toys or action figures

246
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,860
or even baseball cards.

247
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,640
Special edition means that they're produced specially on one occasion, at one time.

248
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,600
They're not always produced.

249
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Right.

250
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,680
So for example, if you have like you say, baseball cards or maybe action figures.

251
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,560
They're produced normally but then a limited amount, a special type of the same action

252
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,640
figure will be produced.

253
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,000
So that's a special edition or also commonly known as a collector's edition.

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Alright so some people collect stamps, you know stamps for letters that you send.

255
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:47,200
And I know many countries like America offer special edition or collector's edition stamps.

256
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,680
These are produced once and usually they mark a special occasion like the Olympics in 1996.

257
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
We had special edition stamps.

258
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Right.

259
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
So these special edition objects are usually not used.

260
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,720
They're for collectors like the name says, right?

261
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Collector's edition.

262
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Right.

263
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,640
So you plan to sell them later on or you collect them for yourself.

264
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,240
They're not normal.

265
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Right.

266
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,520
They don't really go up in value because they're very limited.

267
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
That's right.

268
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Okay.

269
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,000
So collector's edition, special edition.

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,960
And now when they were talking about the porcelain dolls as well, it's pretty expensive, right?

271
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Almost $200.

272
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,240
That's a really expensive doll.

273
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
And so one of the kids said, you know what?

274
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,880
I think mom and dad won't buy you that because it costs a pretty penny.

275
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,600
A pretty penny.

276
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,080
This does not mean that the penny is beautiful.

277
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Right.

278
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,860
A penny is a one cent coin in the United States.

279
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,440
That means it's very, very low in value, the coin.

280
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,100
But a pretty penny is actually the opposite.

281
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,240
It means it's very expensive.

282
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,040
So how would you use this in another example?

283
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,720
I've always wanted to buy a Ferrari, but man, Ferraris cost a pretty penny.

284
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Okay.

285
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,880
So you have to add the word cost before you say pretty penny, right?

286
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
That's right.

287
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
You can't say it is a pretty penny.

288
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,720
You have to say it costs a pretty penny or it's worth a pretty penny.

289
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Exactly.

290
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
It's worth a pretty penny.

291
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay.

292
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Very good.

293
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,040
And for our last phrase, I think this one is a very good phrase because it describes

294
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,760
a lot of different toys that glow in the dark.

295
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Glow in the dark toys.

296
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Okay.

297
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,200
So something that glows in the dark, the verb here is to glow, means that it can be seen

298
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,880
even when it's dark.

299
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Right.

300
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,280
So for example, when I turn the lights off and I can see this yo-yo in my room, that

301
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
means it's glow in the dark.

302
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,200
It has light even in the dark.

303
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Right.

304
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,520
So there are a lot of different toys and things like this.

305
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,560
Usually glow in the dark toys, they have a green glow, right?

306
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,840
They look green in the dark.

307
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,440
I used to have stars.

308
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,720
So they were stickers, star stickers, and I put them on my ceiling so that when I was

309
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,880
in bed, I could look at them and they were glow in the dark.

310
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,920
So when the lights were off, I still had stars.

311
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,600
You can still see them, right?

312
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,960
So yeah, glow in the dark.

313
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,640
It's a way of describing an item, an object that you are able to see in the dark.

314
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
All right.

315
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,600
So that's all we have for you on language.

316
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
All right.

317
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,640
So that's all we have for you on Fluency Builder.

318
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,600
When we go back, listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk some

319
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
more.

320
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Spongebob Squarepants will be right back after these brief messages.

321
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
What's that on the horizon?

322

Oh, she's pretty.

342
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,840
I've never had a porcelain doll before.

343
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,800
I doubt mom and dad will get you that for your birthday.

344
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,160
She costs a pretty penny.

345
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,280
Plus, you'd most likely break her.

346
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,080

Three board games in one.

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Enjoy playing chess and checkers on this side of the board.

And if you're looking for some more fun, flip it and play the classic game of Sorry.

351
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
That's ingenious!

352
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,480
Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?

353
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,200
Now you can take SpongeBob SquarePants wherever you go with the new SpongeBob SquarePants

354
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Glow in the Dark Yo-Yo.

355
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:12,040
And now, back to our show.

356
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Alright so talking about toys, these are really interesting toys.

357
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,320
Are there any specific toys that you had when you were growing up or that you really, really

358
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
liked?

359
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,160
I had an amazing Brio train set.

360
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,920
This was when I was young and a train set is basically like Legos with trains.

361
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,720
So you build a track and you push the train around the track.

362
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,920
And so I used to have a track that was as big as the living room.

363
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,880
And my challenge, my goal was to use every single piece.

364
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,840
Which is very hard because some pieces don't fit with other pieces.

365
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,920
And so that was my favorite toy because I got to be very creative.

366
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,960
And then you would turn on the train and it would go away.

367
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
It wasn't electric.

368
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,600
So I had to push it myself.

369
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,480
What was your favorite toy?

370
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,080
Actually when I was growing up I used to collect little toy cars.

371
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I had a lot of them.

372
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Surprise!

373
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,280
I used to have a lot of little toy cars and I even had a little special, I don't know,

374
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,320
like a box for them so I could see them.

375
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,520
And then as time went on I got to collect the scale cars, you know the ones that are

376
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,800
1 to 10, 1 to 4.

377
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,680
Did you build them or did you buy them made?

378
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,240
No, usually I bought them made.

379
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,600
I actually tried the whole building model cars, model airplanes, but it's so hard.

380
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Very hard.

381
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Even adults have a hard time with that.

382
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
It's very difficult.

383
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,840
So I don't know what type of kid actually does that when they're growing up.

384
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,480
But yeah, so many toys out there.

385
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,800
So many people collect them, play with them.

386
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,160
You have childhood toys that you're very fond of.

387
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,800
So that's what we want to know.

388
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,600
What type of toy did you grow up with?

389
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,480
What did you like to play with when you were a kid?

390
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
Or if you have kids, what toys do your kids like?

391
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,560
Because we're not too familiar with toys these days.

392
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,160
We'd be curious to hear about those.

393
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
That's right.

394
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
So we want to hear from you.

395
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,520
Come to EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

396
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:12,120
Bye.
