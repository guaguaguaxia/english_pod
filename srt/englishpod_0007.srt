00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
And I'm Erika.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey Erika, how are you today?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Marco, I'm doing really well and I'm really looking forward to today's lesson.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,240
Well so am I because here at EnglishPod we're giving you real English.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Everyday English.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,280
Exactly, English that you hear in movies or in TV shows.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,520
This is English people actually use.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,760
So Erika, what is our topic for today?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,840
Well today we're talking about computer viruses.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,960
Perfect, so I think it's time for us to take a look at our preview.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,040
Okay, today we've got two words to preview.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,760
The first word is virus.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Virus.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Virus.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Virus.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,600
So, if your computer has a computer virus, it means your computer is sick, right?

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,040
Actually a computer virus is a program that is designed to harm or to damage your computer.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,680
Oh I see, okay.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,520
Well, thank you for being so technical.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,320
That's the technical explanation.

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,480
Okay, let's take a look at our second word for our preview today and that would be froze.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Froze.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
Froze.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Froze.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,320
So, if your computer froze, it means that...

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,480
Your computer stopped working.

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,360
Your applications or your programs stopped working and you just can't do anything.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,600
Your computer is broken.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Okay, great.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,240
So, let's listen to our dialogue.

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,440
It's going to be a little bit fast but...

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,560
Don't worry if you don't understand everything.

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,600
At the end of this podcast, you'll understand everything.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Perfect, let's listen.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:50,040
Oh great, the stupid computer froze again.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,160
It's the third time today.

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:00,760
Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
It's acting up again.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
It must have a virus or something.

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:16,560
Just give me a second, I'll be right up.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,120
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
files.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,720
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,720
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,320
Well, you have to make sure their antivirus software is updated regularly.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,520
Yours wasn't up to date.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,880
That's probably what was causing your problems.

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,640
Okay, anything else?

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:49,480
Um, yeah, sorry about that.

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,280
Well I completely understand this guy.

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,520
When my computer freezes, I kick it and punch it and do everything to it.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,040
I hope you don't punch it too hard, Marco.

56
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,080
Well it's still working so it's alright.

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Okay.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,340
Alright, let's take a look at our language takeaway.

59
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,640
Language takeaway.

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,440
In today's language takeaway, we have two words.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,580
The first word for today is infected file.

62
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,320
Infected file.

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,120
Infected file.

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Infected file.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,740
And what is an infected file?

66
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,160
An infected file is a file in your computer that has a virus in it.

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Ah, perfect.

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,660
That's really clear.

69
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,280
What is our second word for the language takeaway today?

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,000
Our second word is not up to date.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,140
Not up to date.

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,220
Not up to date.

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,200
And what is it when something is not up to date?

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,600
It means it doesn't have all the most recent information.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
Okay, perfect.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,520
Now let's listen to some examples.

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,200
Example one.

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,520
I need to buy a new computer because mine isn't up to date.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Example two.

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,560
I can't find the street.

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,880
Are you sure this map is up to date?

82
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Example three.

83
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,080
Sarah has just finished the reports and all the information is up to date.

84
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,800
Okay, that was pretty clear.

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
You know, you can also use this phrase positively.

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
You can say up to date.

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Okay, for example, we can say this is a new map.

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
This is the most up to date map.

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Exactly.

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Or if I bought a new computer, I could say I just got a new computer.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,640
All my software is up to date.

92
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Okay, great.

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,120
So now let's take a look at some phrases.

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,000
And it's time for putting it all together.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Putting it together.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Okay, so Samuel said a really great phrase.

97
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,760
He said, I'll be right up.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll be right up.

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
I'll be right up.

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
I'll be right up.

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Now, we can use this phrase in a lot of different situations.

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,000
So let's listen to some examples.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,760
Example one.

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,320
Can you help me with my computer?

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,800
I'll be right there.

106
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,880
Example two.

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Come downstairs.

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Dinner is ready.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll be right down.

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Example three.

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Hurry up.

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,240
I need to use the bathroom.

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll be right out.

114
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,600
Okay, really great and clear examples, right?

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah, you know that phrase, I'll be right out.

116
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,160
I used to hear this all the time when I was young.

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Really?

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
How come?

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,840
Well, I have two sisters and we were always fighting for the bathroom.

120
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,120
So someone was always saying, just a minute, I'll be right out.

121
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,480
Ah, yes, that's common.

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
I had that too when I was young.

123
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,260
Okay, now our second phrase is, it turns out that.

124
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,860
It turns out that.

125
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,280
It turns out that.

126
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,760
It turns out that.

127
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
This is a great phrase.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,840
You can use it in many different situations.

129
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,360
Marco, can you give us an example?

130
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Sure.

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,960
For example, I can say, Frank didn't come to work today and it turns out that he was

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
sick.

133
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Yep.

134
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,400
Or I could say, oh, I've been feeling really sick recently.

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,480
Why?

136
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
It turns out that I'm pregnant.

137
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh my God.

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Are you really pregnant?

139
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
No, I'm not.

140
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm just kidding.

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
All right.

142
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,280
So it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it'll be a little bit

143
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,520
slower.

144
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,260
All right.

145
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh great.

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,000
This stupid computer froze again.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,140
That's the third time today.

148
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,720
Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
It's acting up again.

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,040
It must have a virus or something.

151
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,280
Just give me a second.

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,480
I'll be right up.

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,040
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected

154
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,420
files.

155
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,960
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

156
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,040
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,760
Well, you have to make sure that your antivirus software is updated regularly.

158
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
Yours wasn't up to date.

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,640
It's probably what was causing your problems.

160
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,160
Okay.

161
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,640
Anything else?

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,840
Yeah.

163
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Try not to kick or hit the computer.

164
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,640
Um, yeah.

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Sorry about that.

166
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,120
Okay.

167
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,360
That was a lot more clear this time.

168
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Definitely.

169
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Yeah.

170
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I understood a lot more.

171
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Okay.

172
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,680
So now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

173
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Erika, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

174
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,040
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great useful phrases to help you express your ideas

175
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
clearly.

176
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Okay, great.

177
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,560
So let's look at Fluency Builder.

178
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Fluency Builder.

179
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Okay.

180
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,680
So in this dialogue, we know his computer wasn't working.

181
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Right.

182
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,500
So many students would probably say his computer was acting strangely.

183
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,640
His computer isn't working properly.

184
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Exactly.

185
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,040
And that's perfect and that's fine.

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Yeah.

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,920
But there's a really great way to say it that we heard in the dialogue.

188
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,360
It's acting up again.

189
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,520
It's acting up again.

190
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,120
I love this phrase.

191
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
It's acting up.

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Yeah.

193
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,360
It just sounds really natural.

194
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,720
It sounds really natural.

195
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Okay.

196
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,120
We're going to listen to our dialogue a third time, but this time it'll be at the normal

197
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
speed.

198
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,200
Try and see if you can hear these key words.

199
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,480
Oh, great.

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,540
The stupid computer froze again.

201
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,720
It's the third time today.

202
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,560
Hey, Samuel.

203
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,280
Can you come take a look at my PC?

204
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
It's acting up again.

205
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
It must have a virus or something.

206
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Just give me a second.

207
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:55,080
I'll be right up.

208
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,600
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected

209
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
files.

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

211
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,400
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

212
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,840
Well, you have to make sure their antivirus software is updated regularly.

213
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
Yours wasn't up to date.

214
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
That's probably what was causing your problems.

215
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Okay.

216
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Anything else?

217
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Yeah.

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,280
Try not to kick or hit the computer.

219
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Yeah.

220
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:28,120
Sorry about that.

221
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,440
So Marco, I really think that my computer actually has a virus now.

222
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Really?

223
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
How come?

224
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,480
I've been turning on my computer and then suddenly it turns off by itself.

225
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,800
It shuts down by itself.

226
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Yeah.

227
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
That sounds like a virus.

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,320
But I ran a virus scan and there was no problem.

229
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,480
Well, maybe your antivirus software isn't up to date.

230
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Yeah.

231
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
I guess I'd better call Samuel.

232
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Yeah.

233
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,320
You can call Samuel to fix it.

234
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Yeah.

235
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
All right, folks.

236
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,920
