00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,360
My name is Katrin and today we've got a lesson for you that's about an unusual topic, something

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
we've never talked about here on EnglishPod.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
That's right.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,260
As you know in EnglishPod, we like to talk about all sorts of topics, especially topics

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,560
that are real life topics.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,040
So probably a lot of things that you won't find in your normal English notebooks or English

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,360
learning books.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
That's right.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,640
So we want to tell you in advance, today's lesson is about drugs.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,720
So if you're a younger user or you have, if you have kids, maybe they shouldn't listen

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,480
to today's lesson.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,880
But you're going to learn a lot of the names for drugs and also how to turn down an offer

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
of drugs.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,360
So let's check out today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the things

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,240
that you've heard.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,400
Hey man, you want to buy some weed?

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Some what?

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,200
Some weed, you know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,960
Oh, uh, no thanks.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,840
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,040
No, I'm okay, really.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,560
Come on man, I even got dope and acid.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Try some.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
Do you really have all of these drugs?

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,000
Where do you get them from?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
I got my connections.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,920
Hmm, sounds good.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Let's see.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,200
I want, yeah, I want you to put your hands behind your head.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,000
You are under arrest.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,620
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,060
So as Catherine mentioned, obviously everywhere in the world, maybe most likely you've been

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,060
offered drugs.

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,080
So we're not only going to talk about drugs, but we're also going to give you some vocab

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,800
in English, how to reject or turn down the offer of drugs.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,120
And now what we're going to take a look at, let's start in language takeaway with some

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,680
of the names of these drugs in English.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Language takeaway.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,440
Okay, so we're in language takeaway here and I want to warn you, some of these words are

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,520
slang.

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
That means they're not words from like a dictionary.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,600
These are words people use when they're talking to each other in daily life or words that

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,920
you hear on the street.

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
That's right.

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,880
You may even hear them a lot in movies as well.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,160
Yes, movies and TV.

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,400
So this first one, weed, is something, there's even a TV show called Weeds.

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,880
That's right, that talks about this topic.

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,360
So weed is the street name or the most common name for the drug marijuana.

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
That's right.

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,740
Marijuana is the drug name, but there are many, many, many other names in English that

55
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,740
you will hear.

56
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,400
So weed is one of them.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
A weed is a kind of thing that grows like grass or a flower that you cut because you

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
don't want it.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
It's bad.

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
It smells bad.

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
That's exactly right.

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,120
So the colloquial name for marijuana is weed and obviously the person that's being offered

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,960
these drugs doesn't understand what that means.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,240
So he goes on and he gives a couple of different other street names for the same drug.

65
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,200
So the first one, so the next one is pot.

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
That's right.

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,040
So he says pot or ganja or Mary Jane or even chronic.

68
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,540
So all of these are synonyms.

69
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,960
They mean exactly the same thing.

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
They all mean marijuana.

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,760
But then after that, the drug dealer offers other kinds of drugs.

72
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,360
He says blow.

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
So now we may know the verb to blow, right?

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
That's right.

75
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
To blow air.

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
But in this case, it's a noun.

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Okay.

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,180
So he says, I have blow.

79
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,180
That's right.

80
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,580
So he's offering this drug called blow.

81
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
And what is blow?

82
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,840
Blow is the street name for cocaine.

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,520
So there's a very famous movie called Blow and it was about selling cocaine.

84
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,440
So after he talks about having blow, he also says if you want to do a few lines.

85
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,720
And so this is what you'll commonly hear people saying how they do this drug.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
That's right.

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,960
So for example, you may know that many drugs, they're consumed in different ways.

88
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,320
For example, weed, people smoke it, right?

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,440
In this case, when we're talking about cocaine or blow, then that's why he refers to do a

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
few lines.

91
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
All right.

92
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,000
Because people breathe it in through their nose.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,680
So it's a colloquial way of saying of how you say that, how you consume this drug.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Okay.

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,960
So moving along, there's two more drugs that got mentioned in today's dialogue.

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,640
They're dope and acid.

98
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,520
Now dope can mean two different things.

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,840
Sometimes it means marijuana, like some of those other words we heard earlier, but sometimes

100
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,640
it also means a very, very serious drug called crack cocaine.

101
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Okay.

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,800
And that's something that people breathe in and it's very, very addictive.

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,280
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,600
And also the other word that we have there, or the other drug acid, you may know the word

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,960
acid is a very harmful substance.

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,200
Like for example, batteries, they have a certain type of acid that for example, will melt metal

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,840
or if it gets on your skin, it will burn you.

108
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
That's right.

109
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,280
But acid when it's a drug means LSD.

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,200
And that is a drug that people take that makes them see things.

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,680
So it's called a hallucinogenic.

112
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,280
It makes you see crazy things.

113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,480
And it was very, very popular in the 1970s.

114
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
That's right.

115
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,160
So that's acid or LSD.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Very good.

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,240
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here, specifically all the drugs.

118
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,200
Why don't we go back to our dialogue?

119
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,160
Let's take another listen and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

120
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:37,240
Hey man, you want to buy some weed?

121
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Some what?

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Weed, you know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

123
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Oh, no.

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
No, thanks.

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,680
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

126
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,240
No, I'm okay.

127
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Really?

128
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Come on, man.

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,440
I even got dope and acid.

130
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Try some.

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
Do you really have all of these drugs?

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Where do you get them from?

133
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
I got my connections.

134
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,440
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,760
Sounds good.

136
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Let's see.

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
I want.

138
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Yeah.

139
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,040
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

140
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,240
You are under arrest.

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,480
Oh.

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay.

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,800
So now in fluency builder, we've got a couple of phrases for you about the other side of

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,080
things, how to say no to drugs and what you might hear from a police officer like, like

145
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,840
we hear in today's dialogue.

146
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
That's right.

147
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,640
So let's take a look at these phrases in fluency builder.

148
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Fluency builder.

149
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,840
So the first one we hear is no thanks.

150
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,040
So the guy says, um, no thanks.

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
He doesn't want the drugs.

152
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
That's right.

153
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,200
So obviously you're being offered something that you don't like.

154
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Let's take into consideration drugs or maybe somebody wants to offer you a drink or somebody

155
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,000
wants to take you on a date.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
You can say, no thanks.

157
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
No thanks.

158
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
So, hey Marco, you want a drink?

159
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm going to go right now.

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,640
It's only like two o'clock, but you know, we could go for a drink.

161
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
No thanks.

162
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
No.

163
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Oh, okay.

164
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Right.

165
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
And now we also have another phrase.

166
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,480
So if a person insists, the person is continually insisting like, Oh, come on, come on, come

167
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
on, Marco.

168
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Let's go for a drink.

169
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
I really want a drink.

170
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Come with me.

171
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Right.

172
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
And I, and you can say, no, I'm okay.

173
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Really.

174
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
So it may sound confusing.

175
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,120
I am okay.

176
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Because that would mean you're in good health.

177
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I feel good.

178
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
I feel good.

179
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,200
But I am in this case, when you say to someone, no, I'm okay.

180
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,520
You're saying, no, I'm fine the way I am.

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,240
I don't, I don't really need to do anything.

182
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,480
I don't need it.

183
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,560
So I'm okay means I don't need it.

184
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,160
All right, and this is a great way to, to, to really say, listen, no, I don't want it.

185
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Okay.

186
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,080
So those are the two ways that we have in, in which you can say no, we're going to give

187
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
you a couple of more towards the end of the lesson, but let's take a look very quickly

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,880
at our next phrase.

189
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,680
When the police officer said you are under arrest.

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
All right.

191
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,840
So the man didn't know, the person didn't know this was a police officer.

192
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,160
And finally in the end he says, you are under arrest.

193
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
That's right.

194
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Okay.

195
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,200
So in the movies, when they put the, uh, handcuffs on somebody, um, the, the preposition is under,

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,920
it's strange, but you just have to remember this as a phrase.

197
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
You're under arrest.

198
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,560
I am arresting you.

199
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,400
That means you are going to the police station with me.

200
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
You broke the law.

201
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Right.

202
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Or you can say, oh, uh, Tim is under arrest.

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
He's at the police station right now.

204
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Okay.

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
All right.

206
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,040
So we've taken a look at a couple of phrases and a couple of different things.

207
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,080
Why don't we take another short break?

208
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

209
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,440
Hey man, you want to buy some weed?

210
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Some what?

211
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Weed.

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

213
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, uh, no thanks.

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

215
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
No, I'm okay.

216
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Really.

217
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Come on, man.

218
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
I even got dope and acid.

219
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Try some.

220
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,400
Do you really have all of these drugs?

221
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,040
Where do you get them from?

222
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,840
I got my connections.

223
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

224
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Hmm.

225
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,960
Sounds good.

226
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Let's see.

227
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
I want.

228
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah.

229
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,240
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

230
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,960
You are under arrest.

231
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,360
Dope.

232
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,560
All right, so obviously a very serious topic, but at the same time, I think very necessary

233
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,360
because it may happen or you may hear it in a movie and it's part of the English language.

234
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,960
Now obviously we are not advocating or saying that drugs are good or anything.

235
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,680
We are saying we are giving you the tools so you know how to recognize when somebody

236
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,840
is offering you a drug and the way that you can say no.

237
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
That's right.

238
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,480
So remember that these are things that you might hear when you're in a country like America

239
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,200
or England or Australia.

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,000
We hope that you don't have to worry about this, but if you do hear it or you hear it

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
in a movie, you will understand it.

242
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
But Marco, we had some other ways to say no to drugs, right?

243
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,280
To say no to something, to refuse.

244
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,000
So we heard no thanks and I'm okay.

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,560
But what are some other ways to say no?

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,240
Well, for example, if the person also persists or insists, you can say, no, I'm good.

247
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Thank you.

248
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm good.

249
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Yeah.

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,960
So it doesn't really make sense because you're saying I'm good.

251
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,520
What does that exactly mean?

252
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,000
So like Marco, you want a cigarette?

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, I'm good.

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Thanks.

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay.

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So that's a way of saying no thanks.

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No thanks.

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm okay.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Also, I'm cool.

260
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Not saying like, I'm really cool.

261
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,720
It's like saying, no, I'm good.

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm cool.

263
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Thanks.

264
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
That's right.

265
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm cool.

266
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm thank you.

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
No thank you.

268
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Or as well, you can also just say no thank you.

269
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,520
I think the most clear is no, I don't smoke or no, I don't do drugs.

270
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,360
Yes, exactly.

271
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,040
That's the verb that we use when referring to drugs.

272
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,560
You do drugs.

273
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
You don't do drugs.

274
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,160
So he does drugs or don't do drugs.

275
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
You often hear this phrase.

276
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,560
So you can say, listen, no, no thank you.

277
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm cool.

278
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,800
I don't do drugs.

279
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
That's right.

280
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,460
So as we said, this is all the kind of street slang or colloquial, very common ways of

281
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,700
referring to drugs in English.

282
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,460
So you can keep an eye out for that.

283
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,260
If you hear that in movies, now you know more or less what they're referring to.

284
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,560
And also, of course, if you have any questions, any comments or any suggestions, we are always

285
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
available on our website, EnglishPod.com.

286
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
We hope to see you guys there and until next time.

287
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Bye.
