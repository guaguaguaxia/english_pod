00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco. And I'm Erika. And today

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,100
we're bringing you a very, I would say, embarrassing lesson for us men. Right, embarrassing for

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,980
men but I think it's okay for women. That's right, we're going to be talking about buying

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,680
underwear, specifically women's underwear. Right, so obviously not the favorite thing

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,840
for men to do. Well, apart from being a little bit uncomfortable, it's also boring. Yeah,

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,960
it involves shopping, right? It involves shopping, so we're not really big on that. Alright,

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,600
but well, even though it might be a little bit of an uncomfortable topic, there is some

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,480
great language in here, isn't there? Yeah, there's some really good words and of course

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,440
the different types of underwear that we're going to be looking at. But we also have some

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,800
words that we're going to take a look at before we get into our dialogue, so let's start with

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,960
vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,840
Vocabulary preview. Well, we're going to look at two words that will appear in our dialogue.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:06,440
And the first one is lingerie. Okay, so lingerie, this is a nice fancy word, basically for underwear,

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:14,600
right? Right, for women's underwear. So lingerie, but it's very nice, very... Like pretty, sexy.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,560
Sexy underwear, yeah. Now, the spelling of this word is interesting, isn't it? Yeah,

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,600
it's spelled L-I-N-G-E-R-I-E. Lingerie. Yes, don't you love English spellings? So women's

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:37,480
nice pretty sexy underwear. That's right. And our second word, awkward. Awkward. Awkward.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,280
So this is a feeling that men have, especially when they're buying women's underwear. Well,

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,640
yeah, you feel a little bit uncomfortable or it's a strange situation. Or weird or out

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,400
of place. It's awkward. Yes. All right, so we're going to be hearing both of these two

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,120
words in the dialogue. Now, Marco, where are we here? We're going to be at a department

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,840
store at the section where they have women's lingerie and we have a guy buying underwear

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,640
for his girlfriend. All right, well, let's find out what happens.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:20,640
This sucks. I hate buying lingerie. Okay, just find something and get out of here. All right,

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,960
these are fine. Oh, no, don't come over here. Don't come over here. You look a little lost.

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Can I help you? I'm just having a look around. It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow. I'm

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,040
trying to find her something. Well, you can't give her granny panties. Have you thought

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,520
about getting her some sleepwear? We've got these lovely silky nighties or how about some

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,480
nice panties and a bra set? Look, here's a nice satin push up bra and you can choose

30
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,520
a few different styles of undies to go with it. Sure, that's fine. This is so awkward.

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,800
What else do I pick? What size is she? Well, do you want a thong? Some bikini briefs? Maybe

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,680
this nice pair of lacy boy shorts. Just pick something and get the hell out of here. I'll

33
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,440
go with these two. This is mortifying. I just want to get this over with and she better

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,920
thank me for this. Here you are, sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them. Finally. I'm sorry,

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:30,000
sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag. Oh, the poor guy. I totally feel

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
bad for him. Yeah, he was really nervous and of course it was very uncomfortable for him.

37
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I know and then the security guard shows up. Exactly. But we had the opportunity to take

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,960
a look at some really great words and phrases. So let's start off with our first one in language

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,920
takeaway. Language takeaway. All right, well we're going to look at words here that mostly

40
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,800
have to do with underwear, describing underwear. Right. And the first one is granny panties.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Granny panties. Granny panties. This isn't like a real, real word, right? It's not something

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,040
you'll find in a dictionary. No, it's a slang word and we use it to describe really big,

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,320
ugly underwear like your grandmother would wear. All right, so they're not like the sexy

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,100
little underwear. It's more like long and it's not very appealing. Just picture what

45
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:31,020
your grandmother would wear. No. All right, so granny panties. So obviously this guy doesn't

46
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:38,480
want to be buying any of those, but the saleswoman suggests that he try some sleepwear. Sleepwear.

47
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,160
Sleepwear. Okay, so sleepwear. Obviously, clothes you wear when you're sleeping. Now,

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,480
this is really interesting because men aren't really that complicated when it comes to sleeping.

49
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,080
Just throw on a t-shirt and that's it. Well, obviously for women, there are more options

50
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,080
and more different things you can choose from. Okay. So it's a whole separate category for

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,760
women. I know. Even when you're sleeping, you must wear something nice. Yes. One type

52
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:13,080
of sleepwear is silky nighties. Nighties. Nighties. N-I-G-H-T-I-E-S. Okay, so a nightie.

53
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,280
It's basically a dress that you wear when you sleep. Okay. Now, the pronunciation is

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,360
interesting because the first five letters are night. Right. Right, but you don't say

55
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,420
night. You don't say nighty. You say nighty. Yeah, you make the T a D. Nighty. Now, she

56
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:35,360
offered him some silky nighties. Right. So, silky. Obviously, we know silk is a soft,

57
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,440
shiny fabric, right? Right. So when something is silky, it's either made from silk or it's

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,320
soft and shiny. Okay, so some silky nighties. Very soft, shiny nighties. Exactly. Okay.

59
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,360
What about our next word? Well, the sales girl offers different styles of undies. Undies.

60
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,040
Undies. Undies. So, undies is an interesting word. It's basically short for underwear.

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,200
Underwear. Okay. So, you can just call underwear undies. Yes, but I think you mostly use this

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,360
when you're talking about women's underwear. Oh, really? I mean, I don't know if I would

63
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,480
say undies when I'm talking about men's underwear. No, I don't think so. Maybe children's underwear.

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For children. For children, right? Yep. Okay. All right, so we saw some

65
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,600
of the different types of clothing, but now let's take a look at this interesting adjective.

66
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:34,560
Mortifying. Mortifying. This is mortifying. Mortifying. Okay, so when something is mortifying.

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Well, I think we've got some examples to show you what that is like. Example one. And then

68
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:55,280
I fell in front of everyone. It was mortifying. Example two. I was completely mortified when

69
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:08,000
I realized what I had done. Example three. It must have been mortifying for her when

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,440
she realized that her underwear was showing. So, basically, it's very embarrassing. Super

71
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,280
embarrassing. You want to die almost. Yep. Okay. Which is interesting. I mean, mort.

72
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,480
Right from death, right? Yeah, French. Yeah, interesting. All right. Well, etymology here

73
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,320
at EnglishPod. All right, so some interesting... Okay, so we saw the different types of underwear.

74
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,000
We saw this really great word for when you're really embarrassed. So, now let's take a look

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,120
at some of the phrases that you would use when you're really embarrassed in Fluency

76
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Builder. Fluency Builder. All right, well, we have two phrases to look at here. The first

77
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,160
one. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. Okay,

78
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,840
so if I say, I want to get the hell out of here. You want to leave this place really

79
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,040
quickly. Really quickly. Yes. I want to leave. Right now. Now, when you're using this phrase

80
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,760
or this sentence, get the hell out of here. Is it really polite? No, of course not. It's

81
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,800
impolite. Okay, so it's really negative. Very negative and informal, right? Yeah. So, you

82
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,640
would use this maybe with your friends or like in this case, think it to yourself. Yes,

83
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,720
but it's not a good idea to use with your boss or your mother. Right. Yeah. Okay. I

84
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
guess sometimes depending on the tone you use, how you say it, you can sound really

85
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,960
angry, right? Definitely. Right. Okay. All right. Well, let's listen to some examples.

86
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Example one. This place is scary. Let's get the hell out of here. Example two. What are

87
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,160
you doing in my house? Get the hell out of here. Example three. We're at a friend's party

88
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,080
and all of a sudden her parents arrived. We got the hell out of there as quickly as possible.

89
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,480
All right. So, get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here. Now, let's take a look

90
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,480
at our last phrase for a fluency builder. Get this over with. Get this over with. I

91
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,320
want to get this over with. So, you want to finish it really quickly. But you want to

92
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,360
finish it because you're not really enjoying it, right? Exactly. This is something that

93
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,080
you use when the situation is negative. Is negative. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, I just want

94
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,240
to get this over with. Yeah. I want to get this test over with. I want to get this day

95
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,840
over with. I want to get this... Maybe if you're on a bad date, I want to get this date

96
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,980
over with. Yes, exactly. All right. Well, interesting phrases and I think it would help

97
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,480
us to hear them once more in context in the dialogue.

98
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:59,920
This sucks. I hate buying lingerie. Okay, just find something and get out of here. All

99
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,280
right, these are fine. Oh, no. Don't come over here. Don't come over here. You look

100
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,520
a little lost. Can I help you? I'm just having a look around. It's my girlfriend's birthday

101
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,400
tomorrow. I'm trying to find her something. Well, you can't give her granny panties. Have

102
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,880
you thought about getting her some sleepwear? We've got these lovely silky nighties or how

103
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,000
about some nice panties in a bra set? Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra and you can

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,680
choose a few different styles of undies to go with it. Sure, that's fine. This is so

105
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,560
awkward. What ones do I pick? What size is she? Well, do you want a thong? Some bikini

106
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,800
briefs? Maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts? Just pick something and get the hell out of

107
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,720
here. I'll go with these two. This is mortifying. I just want to get this over with and she

108
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:57,640
better thank me for this. Here you are, sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them. Finally. I'm sorry,

109
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,880
sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.

110
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:11,560
All right. So I guess this situation is very common. Men either having to shop for this

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,560
type of article for their girlfriend or wife because it's their birthday or sometimes we

112
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,480
get dragged into a store to buy this. So you're shopping with your girlfriend and she's going

113
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,160
to make you go look at underwear with her. Yeah. I usually don't do that though. I'll

114
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,240
just go to the next section and just look around. Look at tools. Look at TVs and Play

115
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,400
Stations. But you know what? I have seen some men who go shopping with their girlfriends

116
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,000
or wives and actually enjoy buying underwear. See, that's the thing. I think it makes sense,

117
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,520
but I don't know how comfortable you would actually be. I don't know why. I guess just

118
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,400
how it indicates sexuality and all this stuff. I could do it for maybe five or ten minutes,

119
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,480
give my professional advice and then I'm out of there. All right. Well, maybe those guys

120
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,880
who look like they're enjoying themselves are just really talking in their heads, telling

121
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,640
themselves how much they hate this. Exactly. Maybe they're just pretending or listening

122
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,800
to their iPod. Well, tell us, well, guys, I know we've got a lot of male listeners.

123
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,640
Tell us what you think. Are you embarrassed by women's underwear? Right. Or women, why

124
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,880
aren't you embarrassed when you buy men's underwear for your boyfriend or husband? I

125
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,080
think there's a lot to talk about here. So, come to our website at EnglishPod.com. Right.
