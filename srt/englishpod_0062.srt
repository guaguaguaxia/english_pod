00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,060
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,980
And today we're going to be bringing you the second part of our job interview series.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,980
That's right.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,680
So this is an advanced lesson and we're going to be talking about educational background

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,000
and experience.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Right.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,680
So in the first part we saw preparing for a job interview.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,000
Now we are at the job interview and we're just going to be talking about your educational

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,920
background and your job experience.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
That's right.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,480
And the language we're going to learn is going to focus mostly on these two areas.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
Okay, perfect.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,760
So let's take a look at some of the difficult words before we listen to the dialogue in

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,200
vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
All right.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,320
So we're going to talk about a few common words that have to do with education.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,800
Now the first word, I think we might know this one, but there's a little trick to it.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,040
So the first one is major.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Major.

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Major.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,840
So, yeah, I guess everyone knows what a major is, right?

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,160
Yeah, it's the main subject that you study in university.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Right.

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,800
So you can study business as a major or...

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
History.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Exactly.

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Yeah.

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,520
So, but you can also use it as a verb, right?

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
That's right.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,160
I majored in history.

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Majored in.

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,440
So usually it's followed by the preposition in.

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Yes, always.

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
In fact.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
So it's used as a verb.

39
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
I majored in science.

40
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,280
I majored in business.

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Yes.

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Okay.

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,000
So you can say my major is business administration or history, or you can say I majored in business.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
And the same pattern applies to minor.

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Okay.

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
So minor.

48
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,040
This is really interesting because this is more common in English speaking countries,

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
right?

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
That's right.

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
So what exactly is a minor?

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
Well, just like your major, but smaller.

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay.

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,680
So if you major in history, maybe 60% of your classes are in history and you minor in French,

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,600
maybe 30 or 40% of your classes are in French.

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
So basically you can have two subjects in your degree.

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,360
You can have a major in business with a minor in art.

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Yes.

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Okay.

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
That's interesting.

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
All right.

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,840
And another two simple words, a bachelor's degree.

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Bachelor's degree.

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Okay.

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,760
A bachelor's degree is what you get after going to university for four years.

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Okay.

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,400
So you get a master's degree after four years, you get that.

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
After that you get a master's degree.

69
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Right.

70
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
So that's another two years after your bachelor's degree.

71
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Okay.

72
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,680
And I guess a master's is more focused on an area, right?

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Yes.

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
More specialized.

75
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
More specialized.

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
And then the highest degree you can get is a PhD.

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Exactly.

78
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,040
Which is a philosophy doctorate, right?

79
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,360
But you're not actually getting a degree in philosophy.

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
No.

81
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,440
You're getting a PhD in international relations.

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay.

83
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,600
But this is really hard to get.

84
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
You have to go to school for another five or six years, right?

85
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Yeah.

86
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,160
And it's a lot of research and not many people have it.

87
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Yeah.

88
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,560
Anyway, some simple words.

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
But you know what?

90
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,520
It's quite unique to the English speaking world, this system.

91
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,160
So we thought we'd bring it to you now.

92
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
Right.

93
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Perfect.

94
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,720
So now let's listen to this guy who is at an interview and he's going to be talking about

95
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:35,600
his education and work experience.

96
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Thanks for coming in today.

97
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Did you have any trouble finding us?

98
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Please, take a seat.

99
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Thank you.

100
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,040
So let's get started.

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,480
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

102
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Sure.

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,640
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterson University with a major in business administration

104
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,960
with a specialization in information management and I minored in psychology.

105
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,040
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

106
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,000
I wanted to gain some practical marketable skills, which the information management track

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
provided.

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,360
And I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success.

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
Hence the minor in psychology.

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Interesting.

111
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,960
And your postgraduate studies?

112
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,640
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior.

113
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,680
So I pursued a master's in that area.

114
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,980
I also strive to keep my professional skills current.

115
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,600
So I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,920
Very good.

117
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,280
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,160
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,980
Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in

120
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,360
both client care and process management.

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,120
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies

122
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,600
to achieve better customer satisfaction.

123
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Interesting.

124
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Yes, in this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the

125
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,440
overall success of the company.

126
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,540
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about 5%, which

127
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:13,920
had a direct impact on revenue.

128
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,800
Well those are some pretty good answers to those questions, but I don't know, Marco.

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,320
There was a little awkward moment.

130
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,360
I don't know if you guys heard it.

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Natural body...

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Functions.

133
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Functions.

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah.

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Oh dear.

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
Well, making the interview a little bit more interesting, right?

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,880
It doesn't have to be boring.

138
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Exactly.

139
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,960
But what is really interesting is some of the language he used to describe his educational

140
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,720
background and work experience.

141
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,440
So let's look at that now in Language Takeaway.

142
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Language Takeaway.

143
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,980
Okay, so in Language Takeaway today, we have seven words that we want to focus on before

144
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,840
we give you some tips about doing well on a job interview.

145
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
So let's take a look at the first word.

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,640
Course of study.

147
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,320
Course of study.

148
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Course of study.

149
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,900
A course of study.

150
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,280
So what is a course of study exactly?

151
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,920
Basically, it's like a plan of study or a path of study.

152
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Okay, so his course of study was...

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Business administration.

154
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Exactly.

155
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,160
So that is his course of study.

156
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,280
Now let's take a look at our second word.

157
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Track.

158
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Track.

159
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Track.

160
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Track.

161
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,160
So he said he wanted to gain some practical, markable skills that the information management

162
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,880
track provided.

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Exactly.

164
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,920
So what does he mean by this track?

165
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,200
Again, basically, the track of study is like the path of study.

166
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay.

167
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,960
So the direction of your study.

168
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,600
Okay, so I guess it would be like, think of a train and the train tracks, right?

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Exactly.

170
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Where the train travels.

171
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,840
So that's where it's taking you.

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,480
That's the path that he followed or you should follow or you want to follow.

173
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Yes.

174
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Okay, that's pretty interesting.

175
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,880
Now let's take a look at our third word and it's a really nice conjunction.

176
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Hence.

177
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Hence.

178
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Hence.

179
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
H-E-N-C-E.

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Hence.

181
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Hence.

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,480
So it sounds fancy, but what does it mean?

183
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
So therefore.

184
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,200
Yeah.

185
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,180
So you can use it as a conjunction between two ideas.

186
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,760
So he said, what would be an example of how you could use hence?

187
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,760
You could say, the economy is doing poorly, hence people are losing their jobs.

188
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Okay.

189
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Hence.

190
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
Hence.

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Therefore, in consequence.

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Exactly.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
But it just sounds a lot more like professional.

195
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Informal.

196
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Formal.

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Yeah.

198
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Okay.

199
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,760
So try and use this conjunction hence, right?

200
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
Instead of saying so, therefore.

201
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Yep.

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Use it.

203
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,640
Okay, our fourth word.

204
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Pursued.

205
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Pursued.

206
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,960
He pursued a master's.

207
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Okay.

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,400
So to pursue.

209
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,880
To chase after something.

210
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
To chase after.

211
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,120
So you can pursue a master's degree like he did?

212
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Yes.

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
So a promotion.

214
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
A dream.

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,200
Nice one.

216
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,520
Can you pursue a girl?

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes, you can.

218
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
All right.

219
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
So pursue, to chase.

220
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Yes.

221
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Okay.

222
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,160
Now, let's look at our next word.

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Strive.

224
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,520
Another great word you can use in talking about your experience.

225
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,480
To strive is to try really hard.

226
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
To try really hard.

227
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Yeah.

228
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Okay.

229
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,880
So I know we have some examples for strive.

230
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah.

231
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,120
Let's take a listen.

232
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:31,600
Example one.

233
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:41,120
Example two.

234
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,720
Okay great examples of strive.

235
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,760
To fight.

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,160
To try really hard.

237
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Yep.

238
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
All right.

239
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Okay.

240
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,960
Now, the next word, I didn't really know what it meant.

241
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,240
So this is really interesting.

242
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Breadth.

243
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Breadth.

244
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,720
So it's kind of like saying bread, but adding a th at the end.

245
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Yeah.

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Breadth.

247
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Breadth of experience.

248
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Okay.

249
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,960
So this basically means it's wide.

250
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Exactly.

251
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,360
So when you have a great breadth of experience, you have a wide variety of experience.

252
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Okay.

253
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,280
So maybe in different fields or in different jobs.

254
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,760
So you can have experience like in marketing and in a little bit in finance and a little

255
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,960
bit in management.

256
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Yes.

257
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
A breadth of experience.

258
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
All right.

259
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
All right.

260
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,640
And now for the last word, it's actually three in one.

261
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
A three in one deal.

262
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
A three in one deal.

263
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,280
That actually they are very related.

264
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Okay.

265
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,400
So when he talked about his work experience, he was saying he supervised and coordinated

266
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
the customer support team.

267
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Okay.

268
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,600
So he watched over, right?

269
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,720
And made things work together well.

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
To coordinate.

271
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Yes.

272
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,240
So there are really great verbs that you can use when you're talking about your job responsibilities.

273
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Yes.

274
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I supervised.

275
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I coordinated.

276
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Mm-hmm.

277
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,920
And here's another really great one that said to implement.

278
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,520
To implement.

279
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,200
To make something happen.

280
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
To put it in place.

281
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Right.

282
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,440
So he implemented new strategies.

283
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Implemented new policies.

284
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Okay.

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
To set in action.

286
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Exactly.

287
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,840
All right.

288
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,080
So a lot of great vocabulary, a lot of great stuff.

289
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,160
And well, you can use it for when you are at a job interview.

290
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,760
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

291
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,880
And when we come back, we're going to give you some tips so you'll do well in this part

292
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:37,840
of the job interview.

293
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Thanks for coming in today.

294
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Did you have any trouble finding us?

295
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,400
Please take a seat.

296
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Thank you.

297
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
So let's get started.

298
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,680
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

299
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Sure.

300
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,840
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterson University with a major in business administration

301
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,760
with a specialization in information management.

302
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,120
And I minored in psychology.

303
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,240
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

304
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,200
I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track

305
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,480
provided.

306
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,640
And I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence

307
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
the minor in psychology.

308
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Interesting.

309
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,120
And your postgraduate studies?

310
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,840
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior.

311
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,880
So I pursued a master's in that area.

312
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,160
I also strive to keep my professional skills current.

313
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,600
So I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

314
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Very good.

315
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,480
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

316
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,280
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

317
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Yeah.

318
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,160
I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in

319
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,520
both client care and process management.

320
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,280
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team, as well as implemented new strategies

321
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,640
to achieve better customer satisfaction.

322
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Interesting.

323
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Yes.

324
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,080
In this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall

325
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,620
success of the company.

326
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,720
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about 5%, which

327
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,640
had a direct impact on revenue.

328
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,400
All right.

329
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,720
Well, I want to talk about two main things.

330
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,640
And the first thing I want to talk about is how you address this question about your educational

331
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
background.

332
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,280
Like, what is the interviewer looking to find out?

333
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,400
Okay, perfect.

334
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,120
So when you are talking about your educational background, you shouldn't only talk about

335
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,200
your college degree, right?

336
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Yeah.

337
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,440
You should talk about any type of training that you've had.

338
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Yeah.

339
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
I think it's really important to let the interviewer know that you're continually trying to update

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,160
your skills and improve your knowledge.

341
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,320
So any sort of courses or seminars that you might attend, this is a great chance to highlight

342
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
those.

343
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
And that's what the interviewer is looking for, right?

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,840
Also, any trade publications, any magazines that you read related to your job is a great

345
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,760
way to sort of highlight your desire to keep learning.

346
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, I think that's really important because it's good that you went to a good university,

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,440
you got this degree and everything, but continuously training yourself and maybe just by listening

348
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,940
to business podcasts or reading specific magazines or stuff like that, that is demonstrating

349
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,680
that you care about what you do and that you are continuously learning, right?

350
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Exactly.

351
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
Okay.

352
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,280
So those are the main things to talk about in your educational background.

353
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,400
Now when this work experience question pops up, what should you really say?

354
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,800
When you're answering this question, I think there's something really important to keep

355
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
in mind.

356
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
What's that?

357
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,640
You want to make sure that you're being as specific as possible, right?

358
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Right.

359
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,280
So giving examples of what you've done.

360
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,560
Like really specifically what you did, all of the sort of the main achievements you have.

361
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Okay.

362
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,640
So like for example, we saw in our dialogue that he talked about specific strategies that

363
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,360
he implemented to improve customer support in that company.

364
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Right.

365
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
And then he gave some numbers.

366
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Right.

367
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,580
He said, yeah, he lowered the churn rate to about 5%.

368
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,280
So it's so important whenever you can attach a number to your success or your achievement

369
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,320
to be able to do that in the interview really, really demonstrates your achievement.

370
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah.

371
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,200
I think that's really important.

372
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,720
And another thing when you're talking about previous jobs is make sure you keep it on

373
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
a positive note.

374
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,560
Even if your experience was not very good or you didn't like the company or you had

375
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,960
problems, you should avoid talking about that and always keep it on a positive note.

376
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Right.

377
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,060
So if the interviewer asks you why you want to join this company, why you're looking to

378
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,520
leave your current job, you want to give these positive reasons.

379
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Right.

380
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,680
I didn't do well because my boss was a jerk or I didn't like the company anymore.

381
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,040
You know, you should answer it with something positive like, well, I think I need a change

382
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,920
or this job opportunity is more aligned with what I want to do in the future, etc.

383
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah.

384
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,120
So positive always on your interviews and just again, prepare for these questions that

385
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
are always going to be there.

386
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Yes.

387
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,640
So Erica, I know that you've done a lot of interviews and I understand that you've had

388
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,040
a really weird question.

389
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,080
Yes.

390
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,240
In an interview, I once got this question.

391
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,680
If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?

392
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Really?

393
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Yeah, I'm not kidding.

394
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I really was asked that question.

395
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,960
What did you answer?

396
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,240
I think I said that I would want to be a willow tree because they're really beautiful.

397
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Was that the right answer?

398
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't know.

399
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Like, what are you supposed to answer to that question?

400
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,040
I really don't know what the right answer was.

401
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,520
Well, some people, yeah, they'll ask you just, I don't know, random questions just to see

402
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,800
what your response is.

403
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,240
I think also maybe it's just how you deal with the pressure.

404
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,520
With the unexpected questions.

405
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Right.

406
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,920
So it's like, that is pretty unexpected, but I guess you handle it pretty well.

407
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Okay.

408
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Well, I mean, I got the job, so.

409
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Oh, nice.

410
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
All right.

411
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
All right.

412
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,600
I want to know from our listeners, if they were a tree, what kind of tree they would

413
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,880
be?

414
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,160
Yeah.

415
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,840
And also tell us about, well, your job experience or your educational background.

416
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,680
Well, I know for example, that I've had a lot of different types of jobs.

417
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,520
I've even been that person that gets on the bus and charges people the money.

418
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
I know.

419
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,200
Like, you've had every job under the sun.

420
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
So, but it's great.

421
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,320
So tell us, what's the weirdest job you've had?

422
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,040
What's the craziest or the best job or any experiences?

423
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes.
