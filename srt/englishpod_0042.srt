00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,840
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,120
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,560
And today with Erica, we're bringing you a great lesson about time.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
You need more of it.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,880
We need more time, right?

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
Yeah.

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,440
So we're going to be teaching you how you can ask for more time.

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,280
If you're working on a project at work and you can't finish it on time, you have to ask

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,880
your boss for more time.

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Right.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,240
So in our dialogue, Casey needs more time to put together a press kit.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
What's a press kit?

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Good question.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,680
A press kit is something the marketing department will put together.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,680
Basically pictures, logos, information about the company.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
So when a newspaper or a magazine wants to write an article about them, so they have

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,720
something already prepared that they could give the newspaper or magazine.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,800
Okay.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,940
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,520
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit difficult

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
to understand.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:11,000
We'll come back in one minute and tell you about some of the key language.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,400
So Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,600
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,520
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,760
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,800
Why are things delayed?

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,880
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm not looking for excuses here.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,680
I just want to get this finished on time.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,720
I know.

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
And I apologize for the delay.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,480
But some things were just beyond my control.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,960
I had trouble booking the photographer.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,380
And then Michael was sick for three weeks.

38
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,120
So I couldn't include him in the photos.

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,720
And the design team lost all the files.

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,000
So I had to redo the pictures.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,840
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
I want those photos ASAP.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,040
All right.

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,880
So Casey is in trouble, I think.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Yeah, I think her boss is pretty upset.

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Yeah.

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,560
So let's take a look at some of the language that we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,460
Language Takeaway.

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,440
First word today is deadline.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Deadline.

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Deadline.

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Deadline.

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
So, Erika, what's a deadline?

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
It is the last possible date to do something.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,640
So for example, when we were in school, our teacher would send us homework and say it

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,940
was for Friday.

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,480
So the deadline was Friday.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,160
Was Friday, right?

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,240
Or when you're at work, you have projects that you have to finish by a certain date.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
That's your deadline.

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Exactly.

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Okay, let's look at our next word.

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Extension.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Extension.

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Extension.

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Extension.

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,920
So extension and deadline go together, right?

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Exactly.

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,240
If you can't reach your deadline or you can't make your deadline, you must ask for an extension.

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
An extension.

71
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,720
So you ask for more time.

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Yeah.

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,240
So extension is moving the deadline in the future.

74
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,520
Alright, interesting.

75
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,480
Let's look at our next word.

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,320
Ran into.

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,040
Ran into.

78
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Ran into.

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Ran into some problems.

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,320
So we ran into some problems in this dialogue.

81
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,400
Let's listen to some more examples of run into so we can understand the meaning.

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Example one.

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,840
We ran into a storm on our way home.

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Example two.

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:51,800
If you're not careful now, you're going to run into a lot of problems later.

86
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Example three.

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,560
I ran into some trouble with my computer.

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
Okay, good example.

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,520
So it's clear now, right?

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Right.

91
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,800
If you run into problems, you meet some problems.

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Right.

93
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
Many students say it in that way.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
I met some problems.

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Yeah, but that's wrong.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Right.

97
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
So you would say I ran into some problems.

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Right.

99
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,200
I met some problems is wrong, wrong, wrong.

100
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,480
Okay, don't say met some problems.

101
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,040
I ran into some problems.

102
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I ran into.

103
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Okay.

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
And our last word for language takeaway, delayed.

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Delayed.

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Delayed.

107
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Delayed.

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,760
So when something is delayed, it's late.

109
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Late.

110
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,200
And the opposite is...

111
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
On time.

112
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
So your flight was delayed.

113
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
Or your flight was on time.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,820
The project was delayed.

115
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,560
Or your project was on time.

116
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Clear.

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Alright.

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
So now let's go back to the dialogue.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
Let's listen to it again.

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,400
And this time it will be a little bit slower so you can understand some of these phrases

121
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:01,000
we just talked about.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,480
So Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

123
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,640
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

124
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,560
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,800
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
Why are things delayed?

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,880
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

128
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm not looking for excuses here.

129
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,160
I just want to get this finished on time.

130
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
I know.

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,640
And I apologize for the delay.

132
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,880
But some things were just beyond my control.

133
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,560
I had trouble booking the photographer.

134
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
And then Michael was sick for three weeks so I couldn't include him in the photos.

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
And the design team lost all the files so I had to redo the pictures.

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

137
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I want those photos ASAP.

138
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,560
Okay, so there were some really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue.

139
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah, some wonderful phrases that you can use when you want to ask for more time.

140
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,080
Okay, so let's look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
Alright, what's our first phrase?

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
I've been meaning to talk to you.

144
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
I've been meaning to.

145
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,640
I've been meaning to.

146
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,200
Okay, we have some really great examples of how you can combine I've been meaning to with

147
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
different verbs.

148
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,280
Yeah, let's listen.

149
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,080
Example one.

150
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm sorry I haven't called you yet.

151
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,520
I've been meaning to, but I've been busy.

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,240
Example two.

153
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,360
I've been meaning to tell you, but John quit yesterday.

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Example three.

155
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,160
I've been meaning to see that film for a while.

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,960
I've been meaning to go to that restaurant, but I haven't had time.

157
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,720
So you've been wanting to for a long time.

158
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Right.

159
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
I've been thinking about it.

160
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
I've been planning to do it.

161
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
But you just haven't done it.

162
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,800
I haven't done it, maybe because I haven't had time or money.

163
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,440
Okay, good phrase.

164
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
Our next phrase is beyond my control.

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,400
Beyond my control.

166
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,320
It's beyond my control.

167
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,040
So it means that I can't control it.

168
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
You can't do anything about it.

169
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I can't do anything about it.

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
The weather is beyond my control.

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,360
Right, or relate with this project because Jane was sick for one month.

172
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
It was beyond my control.

173
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,360
Okay, it wasn't your fault.

174
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
No.

175
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
It was my fault.

176
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,760
And our last phrase for fluency builder, put this off.

177
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
Put this off.

178
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,180
Put this off.

179
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,200
Put this off.

180
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,980
So let's listen to some more examples of put this off before we explain the meaning.

181
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,240
Example one.

182
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,880
I've been putting off this project for a week and it's due tomorrow.

183
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,640
Example two.

184
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,920
Can we put off our meeting until next week?

185
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm too busy right now.

186
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,080
Example three.

187
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,320
I've been putting off my email all day and now I have 50 messages to respond to.

188
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,240
So Marco, when you put something off, you leave it for later.

189
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Okay.

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Right.

191
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm going to write a report today, but I'm going to put it off till tomorrow.

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
So you're going to do it tomorrow.

193
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I'll do it tomorrow.

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,880
Okay, so we've seen some really great words and some really good phrases.

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,920
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,480
some more.

197
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,000
So Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,080
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,040
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

201
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,360
Why are things delayed?

202
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Well, the thing is we ran into a lot of problems.

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm not looking for excuses here.

204
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,200
I just want to get this finished on time.

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,240
I know.

206
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,000
And I apologize for the delay, but some things were just beyond my control.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,880
I had trouble booking the photographer and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so

208
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,600
I couldn't include him in the photos.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,480
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

211
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I want those photos ASAP.

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:09,360
Well, Marco, do you think that Casey's reasons for being late are good?

213
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,240
I think so, because it wasn't really her fault, the whole situation with the photographer.

214
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,920
And then one of her co-workers was sick for three weeks.

215
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
It's not really her fault, right?

216
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Right, but maybe the boss thinks that she's making excuses.

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,080
Maybe she's making excuses.

218
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
That's really common.

219
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,560
Like, for example, when we were kids, you would say, oh, you know, my dog ate my homework.

220
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,840
Right, but that really happened to me once.

221
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Your dog ate your homework?

222
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
My cat ate my homework.

223
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,280
Your cat ate your homework?

224
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Yeah.

225
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
What did your teacher say?

226
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,840
Well, actually, I was a really good student, so my teacher believed me.

227
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,760
Well, my teacher wouldn't have believed me.

228
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Really?

229
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
No, no.

230
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,920
She would have called my parents, most likely.

231
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,040
My cat really did eat my homework, and I just left it on the table, and it chewed it all

232
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
up.

233
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
That's weird.

234
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Why would your cat do that?

235
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I don't know.

236
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
A lot of weird excuses out there.

237
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Yeah.

238
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
I was abducted by aliens.

239
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,680
My mom accidentally mailed my homework to Africa.

240
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Really?

241
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Yeah.

242
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
This happened to you?

243
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Yeah.

244
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Writing, creative excuses.

245
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,840
Well, I want to hear from our listeners.

246
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to know what excuses they've used for being late with something.

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,280
