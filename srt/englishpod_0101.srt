00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,080
Welcome back to another edition here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,580
And today we are doing the third part of our Old English series and today we're transported

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,960
back to the 1970s.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
That's right.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,240
So we're going to learn some 1970s slang, some phrases that were really popular back

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,520
in the 70s but are also still in use today.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Exactly.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,600
So it's going to be a very cool lesson today.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,880
And before we start with the dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words that we're

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,840
going to find in Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,800
Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,200
Well we have two words for you in Vocabulary Preview and they're both found in the dialogue.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,320
The first one, roller rink.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
A roller rink.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
A roller rink.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,560
Okay, so a roller rink.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,600
Let's break that down and let's look at the first part.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
All right.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
So roller.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,000
You might recognize this from roller blades or roller skates.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Okay, so yeah, when you go roller blading, roller skating, those things that you put

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,440
on your feet to skate.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,040
Right, wheels, not like a blade or a knife.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Exactly.

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
So that's roller.

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,160
And what about rink?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,120
Rink is the place where you do skating.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,440
Okay, so if you go to a roller rink, it's this big area where everyone can roller blade

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
or roller skate.

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
That's right.

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Okay.

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
And what about the next word?

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
A block.

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Block.

38
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,920
Okay, so this is a noun, a block.

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,280
And a block is a part of a city that is surrounded by four streets.

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,480
Okay, so a city is made up of many blocks.

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah.

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,640
And everyone lives on a block.

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Exactly.

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,960
So it's a square within the city.

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
All right, very good.

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,840
So these are the two words that we previewed and we're going to listen to them now in the

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
dialogue.

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,760
We're going to hear two guys just talking about normal everyday things, but we're going

49
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,440
to be listening to them in 1970.

50
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:06,760
Hey man, how's it hanging?

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,600
Hey man, everything is just groovy, baby.

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,640
I heard it was far out, man.

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,880
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

55
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,640
I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,160
Right on, right on.

57
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,080
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite.

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,760
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Gravy!

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,160
He's always hitting me up for cash.

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,040
Anyway, you want a book and go grab some grub?

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Yeah, man.

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm starving.

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:54,160
OK, groovy dialogue.

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,360
Yeah, really nice, huh?

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
Alright, so some interesting language in here.

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,640
Like we said, it sounds a bit strange, but a lot of this is still used today in modern

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
English.

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,600
So why don't we look at some of these words in Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Language Takeaway.

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Alright, on Language Takeaway today, we have the first word, far out.

73
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Far out.

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,520
That was far out.

75
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
To be far out.

76
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,960
OK, so it's just another way of saying cool.

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,120
Cool, that was nice.

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Yeah.

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
It was really cool.

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
So they went to the roller rink, it was far out, it was really cool, but the other guy

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
couldn't go because he saw a foxy lady.

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
A foxy lady.

83
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,700
OK, foxy lady.

84
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,760
So basically a foxy lady is a really good looking or sexy woman.

85
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,040
Right, commonly you would hear some men refer to an attractive woman as a fox.

86
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,520
OK, so foxy lady.

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Now, Marco, can we say a foxy man?

88
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,360
No, this is a phrase that you would only use for women.

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
OK, so foxy lady.

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Foxy lady.

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,760
So after he met up with the foxy lady, they both just decided to mellow out at her place.

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
To mellow out.

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
To mellow out.

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
OK, so mellow out.

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
What does this mean exactly?

96
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Basically just to relax.

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,280
Right, so to relax, to take it easy, to mellow out.

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
So what did you do on the weekend?

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Oh, nothing.

100
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,320
I just stayed at home and mellowed out.

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
OK.

102
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Alright, and so the response to that was...

103
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Right on.

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Right on.

105
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Right on.

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
Right, right on, right on.

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,760
And so basically they're saying, OK, good, I agree.

108
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,640
Yeah, this phrase, you can say as good, yeah, that's nice, or you can also say it as well,

109
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,060
correct, correct, I agree.

110
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,160
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this word in other situations.

111
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
Example one.

112
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Right on.

113
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
You got a high score.

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,720
That's amazing.

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Example two.

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
You got the job?

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,560
Right on.

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Example three.

119
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Jenny was right when she told me she thought Rick was no good for me.

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I should have listened to her.

121
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,240
OK, so I think that's pretty clear.

122
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,680
We can see how it means correct or also OK, good.

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
Alright, right on.

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,600
And now we also have another word that's similar to far out.

125
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
He said gravy.

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Gravy.

127
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Gravy.

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Gravy.

129
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,680
Now, if you look it up in a dictionary, it's going to tell you something else, right?

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,400
Gravy is a sauce you put on meat.

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Right.

132
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,480
But in this case, we say gravy is cool.

133
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
It's nice.

134
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Yep.

135
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Right?

136
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
So gravy.

137
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,480
And now, finally, at the end of their conversation, they said, wanna book?

138
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
OK, let's book.

139
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Book.

140
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,040
So, to book is a verb.

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,320
Yeah, interesting verb.

142
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,280
It basically means to leave a place quickly.

143
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,060
OK, so we have to book.

144
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
The police are coming.

145
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Right.

146
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Or, I got to book, guys.

147
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm late.

148
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
So, book.

149
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,360
To leave quickly, to leave suddenly.

150
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Yep.

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,080
And that word is used quite commonly today, isn't it?

152
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
It's used among like younger people.

154
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
You would say, yeah, let's book.

155
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
This party is dead.

156
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
OK, great.

157
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,880
So, there's a lot of pretty cool phrases in this dialogue.

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,640
Pretty groovy phrases.

159
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Why don't we hear them again in context?

160
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Hey, man.

161
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,640
How's it hanging?

162
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Hey.

163
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Everything is just groovy, baby.

164
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,360
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

165
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,640
I heard it was far out, man.

166
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:40,200
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

167
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,920
I was chatting her up a bit, and then we mellowed out at her place.

168
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Right on, right on.

169
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,940
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry, and he said it was dynamite.

170
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,440
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

171
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Gravy.

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,340
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

173
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,040
He's always hitting me up for cash.

174
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,240
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah, man.

176
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm starving.

177
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
All right.

178
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,840
So, now that we understand these six words that we saw in Language Takeaway, it's time

179
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,400
for us now to take a look at some great phrases that we can use today in Fluency Builder.

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Fluency Builder.

181
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
OK.

182
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,520
So, at the start of the conversation, there was an interesting way he started talking

183
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,840
to his friend, right?

184
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
All right.

185
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
He said, how's it hanging?

186
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
How's it hanging?

187
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
How's it hanging?

188
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
OK.

189
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,640
So, basically, how is it going?

190
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
How's it going?

191
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
How are you?

192
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,680
Now, you notice in the spelling that we do have a G at the end, I-N-G, right?

193
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Yeah, but usually you don't really pronounce the G in this context because it's very informal.

194
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,600
So, how's it hanging?

195
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
How's it hanging?

196
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,760
He said everything was just groovy and then he started telling him about how he met a

197
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,080
girl and he chatted her up a bit.

198
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,560
To chat her up.

199
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
OK.

200
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,320
So, to chat somebody up.

201
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,760
So, when you chat someone up, you talk with them, right?

202
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,960
Yeah, you're making conversation.

203
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,920
But it's more than just conversation, isn't it?

204
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah, you're trying to be a little bit flirty and maybe say nice romantic phrases or something

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
like that.

206
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Yeah, so usually it's between a woman and a man, right?

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,240
And it's the man who chats up the woman.

208
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Yeah, exactly.

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,800
So, a little bit of a sexist phrase here.

210
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
To chat someone up or to chat up a girl, right?

211
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
OK, so he was chatting her up.

212
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
That's right.

213
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,520
And so they were talking about how Jim went to the roller rink but he didn't have any

214
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,040
money, right?

215
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,000
Because Jim is always hitting his friends up for cash.

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,880
OK, so to hit someone up.

217
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
To hit someone up.

218
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
So, before we explain this word, let's listen to some other examples so then we can maybe

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
understand the meaning.

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
Example 1.

221
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,000
Can you believe Patrick?

222
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,520
He came up to me a month ago and tried to hit me up for some money.

223
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,440
Example 2.

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,200
When I was a kid, I used to always hit my dad up for lunch money.

225
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Example 3.

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,800
This is the last time I lend you money.

227
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,920
Don't even try to hit me up for more.

228
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,840
All right, so when you hit someone up for something, you ask for it.

229
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,720
So usually it's to ask for money, right?

230
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
That's right.

231
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
OK, so to hit someone up.

232
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,160
And now for our last phrase.

233
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,720
Let's book and let's go grab some grub.

234
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,640
To grab some grub.

235
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Grab some grub.

236
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
OK, let's break this one down.

237
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
With the final word, grub, what are we talking about?

238
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
Grub is an informal way of saying food.

239
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,240
OK, so to grab some grub is to get some food quickly.

240
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah, let's go get some food.

241
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,640
All right, so maybe it's time for us to grab some grub.

242
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,760
And while we're doing that, you can listen to the dialogue one last time.

243
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:15,000
Hey man, how's it hanging?

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Hey man, everything is just groovy, baby.

245
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

246
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,840
I heard it was far out, man.

247
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,040
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

248
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,800
I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

249
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,320
Right on, right on.

250
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,240
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite.

251
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,960
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

252
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Gravy!

253
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,560
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

254
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
He's always hitting me up for cash.

255
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,120
Anyway, you want a book and go grab some grub?

256
00:10:50,120 --> 00:11:02,240
Yeah, man, I'm starving.

257
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,200
All right, so some interesting phrases and even though some of these words you may not

258
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,120
really commonly hear anymore, they might still be used in movies or something that's related

259
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,240
to the disco era because it's very, very popular still, right?

260
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Yeah, that's right.

261
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,160
And some of our more advanced users could even use a lot of these phrases in a kind

262
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,080
of funny way to reference back to 1970.

263
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,160
Yeah, exactly.

264
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,760
So it's fun and well, you will use them or you will hear them from time to time, even

265
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
today.
