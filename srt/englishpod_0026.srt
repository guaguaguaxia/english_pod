00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,880
Happy New Year.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,040
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,040
Happy New Year.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,720
Happy New Year, Marco.

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,120
It's December 31st and we are on New Year's Eve.

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
That's right.

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,280
And since it's New Year's Eve, we're talking about New Year's resolutions.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
Right.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,880
In many places, it's very common to make a promise for the New Year, something that you

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
will change.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
Yes.

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
A promise to yourself.

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
To yourself.

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
To change something.

17
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,480
And that's what our dialogue is about today.

18
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,160
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Vocabulary Preview.

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
Okay.

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,200
On vocabulary preview today, we only have one word.

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,560
Eating habits.

23
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
Eating habits.

24
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Eating habits.

25
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,200
So what are eating habits?

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,520
The regular way you eat.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,640
Right.

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,880
So if you eat healthy or if you eat lots of unhealthy food.

29
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Or even maybe what time you eat, right?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,360
If you eat every day a certain time.

31
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Yeah.

32
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Eating habits.

33
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Okay.

34
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,560
So we're ready to listen to our dialogue today and it's going to be a little bit fast, but

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
don't worry about it.

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:20,280
We'll come back and explain all of the key vocabulary after.

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,480
So did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,520
I've decided to go on a diet.

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,160
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
Exactly.

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,080
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

42
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,680
No more chips.

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
No more soda.

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,320
No more fried food.

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,560
Uh-huh.

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,360
I've heard this one before.

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,080
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,040
I really mean it.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,360
Trust me, Carol.

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,960
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,600
Thanks, honey.

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
That was a great meal.

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm stuffed.

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:19,680
Do we have any chips left?

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,360
So Marco, do you think this guy will be successful in changing his eating habits?

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,400
Well, I guess he'll never change, but this gives us a great opportunity to look at some

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,680
great vocabulary in this lesson in Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Language Takeaway.

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,800
Our first word on Language Takeaway is junk.

61
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
Junk.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,960
Junk.

63
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,120
Junk.

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,440
So junk comes from junk food.

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Exactly.

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Unhealthy food.

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Yeah.

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Like cheese, chips.

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Hamburgers.

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Yeah.

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
All that junk.

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
All that junk.

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Okay.

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,200
Our second word for Language Takeaway, transform.

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Transform.

76
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Transform.

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Meaning?

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
To change.

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Yep.

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Change.

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Uh-huh.

82
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,920
So this guy is going to transform his eating habits.

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
He's going to change his eating habits.

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Yeah.

85
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Our third word is...

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Stuffed.

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Stuffed.

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Stuffed.

89
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,480
I'm stuffed.

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,320
So we have some great examples on how we can use stuffed and you'll get the meaning from

91
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
it.

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
Example one.

93
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,440
Come on.

94
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
Have one more piece of cake.

95
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,600
Oh, I can't.

96
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,880
I'm stuffed.

97
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Example two.

98
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,120
Oh, I ate way too much.

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm stuffed.

100
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,320
Okay.

101
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm stuffed.

102
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,440
The feeling you get if you eat too much food.

103
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Right.

104
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm full.

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Yeah.

106
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
All right.

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,880
So these are some great words that you can use talking about food.

108
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
And eating habits.

109
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,040
And eating habits.

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,160
And now we can listen to our dialogue a second time and this time, like always, it's going

111
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
to be slow.

112
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:21,600
So did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,760
I've decided to go on a diet.

114
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,760
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

115
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Exactly.

116
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,640
No more chips.

118
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,340
No more soda.

119
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,680
No more fried food.

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,840
Uh-huh.

121
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,320
I've heard this one before.

122
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,200
But this time I'm going to stick to it.

123
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,240
I really mean it.

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,480
Trust me, Carol.

125
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,480
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

126
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,680
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,280
Thanks, honey.

128
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,960
That was a great meal.

129
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,760
I'm stuffed.

130
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,080
Do we have any chips left?

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,920
There's a lot of great language in this dialogue, isn't there?

132
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Yeah, a lot of great language that we can take a look at with our Fluency Builder.

133
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Fluency Builder.

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
The first phrase we have for you is...

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Stick to it.

136
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Stick to it.

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Stick to it.

138
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes.

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,840
We've got some examples of how this phrase is used.

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
So let's listen.

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,400
Example 1.

142
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,720
Quitting smoking is so hard.

143
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Stick to it.

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,120
It's good for you.

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,560
Example 2.

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't solve this math problem.

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stick to it.

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm sure you'll get it.

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,720
So stick to it, right?

150
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Basically means keep doing it.

151
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Right.

152
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,760
Even though English learning can be hard...

153
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,000
You should stick to it.

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Stick to it.

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Exactly.

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,360
Okay, let's look at our second phrase for Fluency Builder.

158
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
I mean it.

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Mean it.

160
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Mean it.

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
So this is a great way of saying...

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I'm serious.

163
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm serious.

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Yeah.

165
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I mean it.

166
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm not joking.

167
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm not joking, right?

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Yeah.

169
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
And our final phrase in Fluency Builder.

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Cut out.

171
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Cut out.

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Again, we've got some examples of this phrase as native speakers use it.

173
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,480
Let's listen.

174
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,040
Example 1.

175
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,280
You have to cut out the salt from your diet.

176
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,360
No more chips.

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,820
No more french fries.

178
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,580
No more popcorn.

179
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,480
Example 2.

180
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,960
It's time for me to focus on my work.

181
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm going to cut out everything else from my life.

182
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,560
Okay, so cut out means...

183
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
To remove.

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Completely remove.

185
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Take it away.

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Take it away.

187
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Yeah.

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,760
Okay, some great language, some great phrases in our dialogue today.

189
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:25,520
So why don't we listen to it a third time and we'll come back in a little bit.

190
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,720
So did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

191
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,760
I've decided to go on a diet.

192
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,480
And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

193
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Exactly.

194
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,300
I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat.

195
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,880
No more chips.

196
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
No more soda.

197
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
No more fried food.

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Uh-huh.

199
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,580
I've heard this one before.

200
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,280
But this time, I'm going to stick to it.

201
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,240
I really mean it.

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,080
Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

203
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,480
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

204
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,880
Thanks, honey.

205
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,520
That was a great meal.

206
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm stuffed.

207
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:24,960
Do we have any chips left?

208
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Okay so New Year's resolutions, a really common and popular thing in North America.

209
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,680
It's tradition to make a promise to yourself on New Year's and stick to it throughout the

210
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
whole year.

211
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Right.

212
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,840
But the funny thing is that very few people actually stick to their New Year's resolution.

213
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
That's true.

214
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,160
The most common ones are I'm going to quit smoking.

215
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,400
That never happens.

216
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm going to go on a diet.

217
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
Like this guy.

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,800
I'm going to quit drinking.

219
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
That almost never happens either.

220
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
On New Year's Eve, you start drinking.

221
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,680
I mean, it's a bad time.

222
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,280
Come on.

223
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,200
And another really common one is I'm going to join a gym.

224
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,520
That's why gym membership sales are so high in January.

225
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Right.

226
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,160
Everyone joins a gym in January.

227
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,520
But come February, very few people in the gym.

228
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah.

229
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,680
So Marco, do you have a New Year's resolution for this year?

230
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,600
Yes, I have a New Year's resolution and I resolve to continue bringing everyone some

231
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,280
great lessons.

232
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,600
Oh, that's so good.

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
And I think I can stick to that one.

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Yes.

235
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,120
Well, I do hope that you do stick to that one, Marco.

236
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
We will.

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
We will.

238
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
But today we're out of time.

239
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,360

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520

Bye.
