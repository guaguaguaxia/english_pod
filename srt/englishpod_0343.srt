00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,980
My name is Catherine and we're here talking about some special foods today.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,980
That's right.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,280
Today we're going to talk about seafood.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,580
So everything that comes from the sea that we eat.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,580
That's right.

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,840
So we're in a restaurant and we're going to hear about the different options this restaurant

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
offers.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:29,120
Let's take a listen to the dialogue.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,520
This is such a nice restaurant.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
I feel so classy.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,960
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,280
May I take your order?

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,440
Yes, I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,480
Excellent choice, sir.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
And for you, madam?

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
Very good, madam.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,760
That seafood platter sounds good.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,160
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,720
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari and filet of salmon and

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
tuna.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,640
It comes with a side of butter sauce and French fries.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
That sounds great.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,160
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Very well, sir.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Anything to drink?

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
Can we get a bottle of your house white wine, please?

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,520
Superb choice.

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,840
I will be back shortly with the wine.

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,360
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,880
So today we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab, so we're going to have two parts

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,320
of language takeaway and let's start with the first one.

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,800
Language takeaway.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,200
Now, in language takeaway part one today, we have a number of really important and useful

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
adjectives.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,280
The first one is classy.

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
That's right.

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,280
So we're going to a nice restaurant and so you feel like you're in a classy place.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,760
Now, a classy place is a nice place.

42
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
You might be expected to dress nicely.

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
It might be a little bit fancy.

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Exactly.

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,440
So, classy is kind of a synonym of fancy or luxurious.

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Right.

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,120
So if you're going on a date with someone, it might be a good idea to go to a classy

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
restaurant.

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
That's right.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,200
But usually if a restaurant is classy, it also means that it's a little bit pricey.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,280
Okay.

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,680
So something that is pricey is expensive and seafood is famous in America for being very

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
pricey.

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
That's right.

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,200
So pricey means that it's a little bit expensive.

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,560
Now going to the food that we're going to get today, we had a couple of different ways

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,200
of describing how the food was prepared.

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,240
So for example, the first one is marinated grilled shrimp.

59
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
All right.

60
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,760
Now, something that is marinated is covered in a sauce or a liquid before it's cooked.

61
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
All right.

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,000
So you can have maybe a regular steak, but you can also have a marinated steak, which

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,120
would be marinated in some kind of flavor like garlic or yogurt.

64
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
That's right.

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,960
So usually you leave it in maybe some sauce like garlic sauce for a couple of hours or

66
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,560
a couple of minutes before you cook it.

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,840
Now when we cook it, there are different ways of cooking things.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,760
In this case, we're having grilled shrimp.

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
All right.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,160
Now grilled is different from fried.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Fried we do in a pan with some oil, but a grill, usually there's no pan, no oil.

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,180
There's just a grill.

73
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,880
So grill, grilled.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Grill is the tool that we use.

75
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Grilled food tends to be quite healthy.

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
There's very little oil.

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,120
It's a bit more dry.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,800
And oftentimes we do grilling outside because there's lots of smoke.

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
That's right.

80
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,960
Because usually you have like maybe a barbecue and you have some charcoal in there or some

81
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,400
wood and that's what you use to cook the food with.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Yeah.

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,420
And grilled food is very easy to notice because there are usually black lines on top and bottom.

84
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,560
That's from the grill.

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
That's right.

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,000
So we've eliminated grilled shrimp for starters.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,800
So what is a starter?

88
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Well think about the word starter.

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Start.

90
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,980
Now a starter is something you eat at the start of your meal, at the beginning.

91
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,080
You eat it before you eat the main course.

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
All right.

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
So it's also known as an appetizer.

94
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
That's right.

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,620
Starters and appetizers are the same thing.

96
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,240
And these are small things you eat before you start to eat your main meal.

97
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,800
So they're not very filling.

98
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Okay.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,720
So yeah, it'll be something small like a soup or maybe like in this case some marinated

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
grilled shrimp.

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Yes.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
All right.

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
So great vocab there.

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:33,400
Why don't we review that part and we'll be back in a bit.

105
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
This is such a nice restaurant.

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I feel so classy.

107
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Yeah.

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,240
It's a little bit pricey but they serve the best seafood in town.

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
May I take your order?

110
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Yes.

111
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,520
I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
Excellent choice, sir.

113
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,660
And for you, madam?

114
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,120
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Very good, madam.

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
That seafood platter sounds good.

117
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

118
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,040
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari and filet of salmon and

119
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
tuna.

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,960
It comes with a side of butter sauce and French fries.

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
That sounds great.

122
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,480
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

123
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Very well, sir.

124
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Anything to drink?

125
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,720
Can we get a bottle of your house white wine, please?

126
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,800
Superb choice.

127
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,080
I will be back shortly with the wine.

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
All right.

129
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,180
So now let's take a look at all the exquisite types of seafood that we have here on Language

130
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,320
Takeaway Part 2.

131
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
All right.

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,100
Now the first thing we have in Language Takeaway Part 2 is a very distinctive animal from the

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
ocean.

134
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,680
It's bright red and it has two claws.

135
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Right.

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,960
We're talking about a lobster.

137
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
Now lobsters, you don't find everywhere.

138
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,140
In fact, there are some parts of America where they're very famous for their lobster like

139
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,580
Maine.

140
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,760
Now these are animals that are hard on the outside and soft and white on the inside and

141
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
they're quite difficult to eat.

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
That's right.

143
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,040
So they look kind of like crabs because they also have the claws and everything but they're

144
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,640
a lot longer, right?

145
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
That's right.

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,320
They're round and a lobster is long and lobsters are also famous for one part, for their tails.

147
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Right.

148
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
The tails are full of meat.

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
They're very delicate, very delicious.

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Okay.

151
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,200
So we're having some lobster and we also ordered some baked oysters.

152
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Now oysters are another kind of thing that comes from the ocean.

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,600
They come in a shell, all right?

154
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,740
And you might hear about oysters because some people, some restaurants like to have an oyster

155
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,600
bar where they serve raw oysters over ice.

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
That's right.

157
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,000
So they look like big rocks basically and when you open them inside, you have meat.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,940
And actually I think you get pearls from oysters, right?

159
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
That's right.

160
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,160
So these two are special.

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
They have a nice relationship.

162
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,740
The pearl forms inside, it grows inside of the oyster.

163
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Very good.

164
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,200
So now we've taken a look at some oysters and talking about these things that have shells,

165
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,080
we also have clams.

166
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,600
Now while oysters are big and sometimes quite shiny, clams are smaller, usually white or

167
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,600
gray and they have lines on them and they're shells that you open up and you eat the meat

168
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
from inside.

169
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Right.

170
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,800
So I guess if you've ever been on the beach and you're collecting little seashells, usually

171
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
those are kind of like clams.

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
That's right.

173
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
They're quite small.

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,640
They can be about the size of an American quarter, 25 cents.

175
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Okay.

176
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,680
So now in this seafood platter that we're ordering, we have clams, we have scallops.

177
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
Ooh, scallops are one of my favorite kinds of seafood.

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,960
They're quite soft and chewy and they're usually white.

179
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Okay.

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,040
And then we have some mussels also.

181
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,280
Now mussels are much different looking.

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
They're also in shells, but they're long and the shells are black.

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
That's right.

184
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,520
So clams are kind of small and round.

185
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,400
The oysters are pretty big and look like rocks.

186
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,440
Mussels on the other hand are long and black and when you open them inside, they're shiny

187
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
also.

188
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,840
They're orange on the inside or yellow and so they're quite interesting looking, but

189
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,880
they're also very famous for the French or Belgian rather, the Belgian dish, Moules Frites,

190
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
which is a nice specialty.

191
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
All right.

192
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,360
And lastly, we are also having some calamari in this seafood platter.

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,480
Oh, this is another one of my favorites.

194
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,840
Now calamari is a kind of food, but the animal is the squid.

195
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Okay.

196
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
So why is it called calamari?

197
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,880
Well calamari, I believe, comes from the Italian word calamaro.

198
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,400
Calamari means that it's squid that's been cooked so that people can eat it.

199
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Okay.

200
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,960
So basically calamari and squid are the same thing.

201
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,560
They are the same animal, but calamari means that it's prepared to eat.

202
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Yes.

203
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
And usually it's fried.

204
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,840
So when squid is fried, it becomes hard, chewy.

205
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
And that's what calamari tastes like.

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
It's quite chewy.

207
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
All right.

208
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Great stuff.

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Let's review everything one last time with this exquisite lesson.

210
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
This is such a nice restaurant.

211
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I feel so classy.

212
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,080
Yeah, it's a little bit pricey, but they serve the best seafood in town.

213
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,400
May I take your order?

214
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Yes.

215
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,560
I would like some marinated grilled shrimp for starters and I'll also have the lobster.

216
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
Excellent choice, sir.

217
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,440
And for you, madam?

218
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
I would like the baked oysters and the seafood platter.

219
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Very good, madam.

220
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,960
That seafood platter sounds good.

221
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
Excuse me, what does the platter have?

222
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,920
It's a great combination of clams, scallops, mussels, calamari, and filet of salmon and

223
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
tuna.

224
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,740
It comes with a side of butter sauce and French fries.

225
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
That sounds great.

226
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,260
Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same, please.

227
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,320
Very well, sir.

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,380
Anything to drink?

229
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,480
Can we get a bottle of your house white wine, please?

230
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,640
Superb choice.

231
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,440
I will be back shortly with the wine.

232
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,560
All right, so seafood, we said, usually has the connotation of being a little bit pricey.

233
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,200
Why do you think that is?

234
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,480
I think it's pricey because the best seafood doesn't come from seafood farms.

235
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,280
It comes from people who go in boats and they collect the seafood in nets.

236
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,740
And also, there are fewer and fewer places now in America where you can find this kind

237
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,160
of food because some places have experienced overfishing.

238
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,120
Too many people are trying to fish.

239
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,880
And also, some places just don't have the right climate for certain animals.

240
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Right.

241
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,080
So, for example, in the United States, you do have, well, the whole country is covered

242
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,000
in the West Coast by the Pacific Ocean.

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,960
The East Coast, you have the Atlantic.

244
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,460
So obviously, you do have some coasts.

245
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,720
But if you're in the middle of the United States, it's probably hard to get seafood.

246
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,560
So, I imagine it's very expensive.

247
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,240
It can be very, very expensive.

248
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,360
So oftentimes, we get lake food.

249
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
It's different kind of fish, but we don't have lobsters.

250
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,480
But you'll find that in the West, you get very good salmon because Alaska in the Northwest

251
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,080
is very famous for salmon from the Pacific.

252
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,720
And in the East, it's very famous for lobster and crab, which are delicious.

253
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Now, even though you have, it's famous for lobster and crab, it's still relatively expensive

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,560
compared to other dishes.

255
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,840
Like for example, I think a lobster, how much would a lobster dinner cost?

256
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
A lobster dinner could cost you $150.

257
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Right.

258
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,280
And you're getting almost the same amount of meat as maybe having a steak that would

259
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
be $20.

260
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,960
Yeah, less meat.

261
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,160
But we have more cows than we have lobsters.

262
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,120
And also, lobsters are famous for being pretty expensive.

263
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,640
It's a very fancy meal to have lobsters.

264
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Exactly.

265
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
So, it's very interesting.

266
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,160
Some countries, for example, so it's very interesting, but some countries, seafood is

267
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,800
very, very inexpensive.

268
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,320
Some communities or some countries or communities that fish or have, for example, shrimp farms,

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
it's very inexpensive.

270
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,760
So, it's such a treat to be able to go there and have seafood all you want and not have

271
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,840
to spend $300 on a meal.

272
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
It is indeed.

273
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,000
And it's really nice to be able to get these big prawns, these big shrimp or lobsters

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,720
and eat them without worrying about the price.

275
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,200
But I'm curious, in your country, do you have seafood?

276
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,480
And if so, what kind?

277
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Is it cheap?

278
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Is it expensive?

279
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Is it pricey?

280
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Let us know.
