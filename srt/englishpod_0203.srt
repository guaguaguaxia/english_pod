00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,400
My name is Kathryn and today we have an elementary level lesson for you all about computers.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
That's right.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,600
So we are going to take a look at some of the basic parts of a computer and also about

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,040
bad programs that could affect your computer and make it not work.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
That's right.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:33,120
So to get going, we have a verb for you that we're going to look at in vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
All right.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,400
So today on vocabulary preview, we have a verb as you said, and it's to crash.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
To crash.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Okay.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,760
This has a couple of different meanings, but in today's dialogue, this means for your computer

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,240
to shut down or to freeze or to stop working.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Right.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,520
So maybe you heard of a car crash, right?

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,720
When two cars, bam, hit each other.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,160
In this case, your computer is just not working anymore.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,440
It stopped working.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
It freezes.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
That's right.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,720
So you can't use it.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,400
So my computer crashed is a way to say my computer stopped working.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
Okay.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,280
So that's a word that we're going to listen in our dialogue today.

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Why don't we jump right into it and we'll be back shortly.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Hello.

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
Thanks for calling one, two, three tech help.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm Todd.

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
How can I help you?

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Hello.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Can you help me on my computer?

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,120
Oh man.

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
It's okay, sir.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Calm down.

37
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
What happened?

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,760
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,000
I mean, the monitor went black.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,160
Okay, sir.

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,720
It sounds like you might have a virus.

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
I don't feel sick.

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,480
Let me check.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Nope.

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
No fever.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm fine.

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,000
No, your computer might have a virus.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,160
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

49
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,840
Maybe that's why it crashed.

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,160
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
or trojans.

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
Phew.

53
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Wait a minute.

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Crash, spyware, trojans.

55
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
What?

56
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Where?

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
When?

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
All right.

59
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:18,760
So lots of great technology words today.

60
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,640
Let's take a look at a few of them in Language Takeaway.

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Language Takeaway.

62
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,080
All right.

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,240
So let's start off with our first word.

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,040
You've probably heard it before, but let's go over it just in case.

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
A laptop.

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Laptop.

67
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,460
A laptop is a kind of computer.

68
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,040
We have desktop, laptop.

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Right.

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,560
So your lap is the top part of your legs.

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,720
So a laptop computer is a small portable computer that you can take with you anywhere.

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
That's right.

73
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,000
A lot of students have laptops and businessmen as well.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,360
So you mentioned the opposite would be a desktop.

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Right.

76
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
So it sits on top of a desk.

77
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Okay.

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,080
So both a desktop and a laptop have monitors, a computer monitor.

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,720
So a monitor is like a TV for your computer.

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,160
It's where you can see what you're doing.

81
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Okay.

82
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,640
So let's call it a monitor or a screen maybe.

83
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,440
You can also use the word screen, but monitor is the technical word for the, usually a box,

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
like a TV that goes with the desktop computer.

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Okay.

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Very good.

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,560
So Todd, the computer guy said, Hey, I think your computer might have a virus.

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Ooh, that doesn't sound good.

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Yeah.

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
A virus.

91
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,360
So I guess you know what a virus is when you get sick, right?

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,120
You get the flu or the cold.

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
That's right.

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,840
You can say I have a virus, but how can a computer have a virus?

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,440
This means it's a program that is designed to hurt your computer.

96
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
All right.

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,720
So it's like your computer is sick and it doesn't work.

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,400
So a virus might make your computer crash.

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Exactly.

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,240
So in order to avoid this, what we need is an antivirus program.

101
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay.

102
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,920
So virus is a bad thing.

103
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Antivirus is a good thing.

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,160
An antivirus program is a program that protects your computer from viruses.

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
So you would say antivirus.

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,160
You might've heard of a very famous program called Norton antivirus or McAfee antivirus.

107
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
These are brands.

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Okay.

109
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Very good.

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,000
So those are some of the main technical terms that we have on Language Takeaway.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,920
Why don't we listen to our dialogue quickly once again.

112
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,320
Why don't we listen to our dialogue quickly again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,840
Hello.

114
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,160
Thanks for calling 123 Tech Help.

115
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm Todd.

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
How can I help you?

117
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Hello.

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Can you help me?

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
My computer.

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
Oh man.

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,000
It's okay, sir.

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Calm down.

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What happened?

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,680
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

125
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,800
I mean, the monitor went black.

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
Okay, sir.

127
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,600
It sounds like you might have a virus.

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't feel sick.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,640
Let me check.

130
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Nope.

131
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
No fever.

132
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
I'm fine.

133
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,040
No, your computer might have a virus.

134
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,080
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
Maybe that's why it crashed.

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,120
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
or Trojans.

138
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
Phew.

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
Wait a minute.

140
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Crash.

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Spyware.

142
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Trojans.

143
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
What?

144
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Where?

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
When?

146
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
I don't know.

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm just kidding.

148
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
All right.

149
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
We're back.

150
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,160
So now, let's start off with three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

151
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,880
This first phrase is one that I know you use a lot.

152
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I use it too.

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
We say, oh man.

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Oh man.

155
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,360
So now, depending on the tone, it can mean different things, right?

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,320
So in this case, what does it mean?

157
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,760
So the man who's having problems with his computer says, my computer.

158
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,320
Oh man.

159
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Right.

160
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
He seems a little bit anguished.

161
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Disappointed.

162
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Yeah.

163
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Oh man.

164
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
So, it's an interjection.

165
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
That's right.

166
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,000
So you can say, oh man, my computer crashed.

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Right.

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,160
Oh man, you're always late.

169
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,520
Now you can also say it for maybe surprise.

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,240
Like oh man.

171
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,800
So when you're excited about something, oh man, this computer game is awesome.

172
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Mm-hmm.

173
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Okay.

174
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,080
So it's just a way of expressing maybe disappointment or in some cases, excitement.

175
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Right.

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,800
So think about the way that you say it.

177
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh man.

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Oh man.

179
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Okay.

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,720
So now, the guy, Todd, he tells him, hey sir, it's okay.

181
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Calm down.

182
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Right?

183
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Okay.

184
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,560
So this might be funny sounding because we say calm.

185
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,800
So be calm.

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Calm down.

187
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
This is a phrase.

188
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,280
It's almost like you're so upset and you're standing up.

189
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Calm down.

190
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Calm down.

191
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Cool it.

192
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Okay.

193
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,060
So you tell someone to calm down.

194
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
That's right.

195
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,440
So you might hear a parent say about their child, the child won't calm down.

196
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
What do I do?

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Mm-hmm.

198
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Okay.

199
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
So it's a phrase.

200
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Let's use it together.

201
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Calm down.

202
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Calm down.

203
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
To calm down.

204
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
All right.

205
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
And now for our third phrase.

206
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,640
I mean.

207
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I mean.

208
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Okay.

209
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,760
So this is also an interjection and it's very, very, very common.

210
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Okay.

211
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,640
So you'll probably hear people when they're talking, they're like, oh, I went over there.

212
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,720
I mean, we went to this place.

213
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
It's an interjection.

214
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
That's right.

215
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,600
And usually we say this when we want to correct what we just said.

216
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,240
For example, your computer might have a virus.

217
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,840
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

218
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Okay.

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,880
So the computer support man, Todd, he understands maybe this person doesn't know what a virus

220
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
is.

221
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,120
So I mean, he's, he's changing what he just said.

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
We could say, oh, Saturday, I'm going to the movies.

223
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,440
I mean, Sunday, I'm going to the movies.

224
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Okay.

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
What are you doing on Sunday?

226
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Okay.

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
All right.

228
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,280
So you use it to correct yourself or maybe further explain something because maybe you

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,960
are talking about a topic and maybe the person is not understanding you so you want to make

230
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
it more clear.

231
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
That's right.

232
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I mean.

233
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Right.

234
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,760
Like, she was very angry at me.

235
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,840
I mean, of course she was because I did something wrong.

236
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Right.

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
So it's a way to offer an explanation.

238
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,920
All right.

239
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,560
So try and use that one in your speech this week.

240
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,920
It's really, really great common English phrase.

241
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
All right.

242
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,760
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a

243
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,760
little bit more.

244
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,040
Hello.

245
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,400
Thanks for calling 123 tech help.

246
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm Todd.

247
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
How can I help you?

248
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Hello.

249
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Can you help me on my computer?

250
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,800
Oh man.

251
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
It's okay, sir.

252
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Calm down.

253
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
What happened?

254
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

255
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,640
I mean, the monitor went black.

256
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,840
Okay, sir.

257
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,400
It sounds like you might have a virus.

258
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I don't feel sick.

259
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Let me check.

260
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Nope.

261
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
No fever.

262
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm fine.

263
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,680
No, your computer might have a virus.

264
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,840
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

265
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,520
Maybe that's why it crashed.

266
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,840
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware

267
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,400
or Trojans.

268
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,960
Phew.

269
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Wait a minute.

270
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Crash?

271
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Spyware?

272
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Trojans?

273
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
What?

274
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Where?

275
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
When?

276
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
All right.

277
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:49,600
So Marco, in today's dialogue, we heard a couple of strange words about computer viruses.

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,960
One of them you might be familiar with from Greek stories and fables.

279
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
A Trojan.

280
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
All right.

281
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
A Trojan.

282
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,320
So it's a kind of bad software that will hurt your computer.

283
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,800
Yeah, it's a type of virus that comes in and it's supposed to be a good program or not

284
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,640
harm your computer, but it's really just a lie.

285
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,720
It's disguised as something else and then it starts to really ruin your computer.

286
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,880
They're very, very dangerous.

287
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Yeah.

288
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
So why do you think it's called a Trojan?

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
I don't know.

290
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Probably because of a Troy something, because it's very difficult like a Trojan.

291
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,400
Well, think about the story of the Trojan horse, right?

292
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
You know that story.

293
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,280
So back in ancient Greece, there was a war happening and Troy wanted to defeat its enemy

294
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,720
and they didn't know how to do it.

295
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,800
So they thought and thought and thought and they came up with an idea.

296
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,760
They would build a horse and they would give it as a gift, but inside the horse would be

297
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,440
warriors, fighters.

298
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,680
So when the city opened its doors to this wonderful gift, they would receive a horrible

299
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,440
gift and attack.

300
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,960
And so Trojan is like that.

301
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,180
It's like software that you think is safe, but then it attacks your computer by surprise.

302
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
They're very dangerous.

303
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,760
And now things have come up like Trojans and worms and a lot of different names for them.

304
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,380
But it's crazy now, although I hear Mac users don't have these problems.

305
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
We do not.

306
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,840
If you use a Macintosh computer, you probably have very few problems with viruses and things

307
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
like that.

308
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Wow.

309
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
So we're all in favor for Mac users.

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Absolutely.

311
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
So let us know.

312
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,240
Have you had problems with a virus on your computer?

313
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
Have you ever called tech support?

314
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

315
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
We hope to see you there.

316
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
All right.

317
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Bye, everyone.

318
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Thanks for watching.
