00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,520
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,360
And today we have a fun and scary dialogue.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,360
That's right.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,040
This lesson is full of language you can use to talk about being scared.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Alright, so we're gonna be looking at a scary lesson today and we have nothing to preview

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,560
so let's listen to this dialogue and see why everyone is so scared.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:39,160
Hey, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,560
It's like ultra spooky.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,320
I told you already Shabby.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,560
The owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,840
So we have to go in and investigate.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,880
I don't like this.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Come on guys, stop being such cowards.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,120
It's a mystery and an adventure.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,400
This place gives me the creeps.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,240
Seriously guys, let's get out of here.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,440
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,880
That laugh came from this room.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,320
Let's go and check it out.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Look, a ghost!

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Run!

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:43,920
Well, that sounds really scary but actually it kind of reminds me of another TV show.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
Very similar to another TV show but it's different.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, but some interesting language that you can use to talk about things that are scary

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,840
so why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,220
Language Takeaway.

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,160
So let's start with the very first line of our dialogue.

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,720
Shabby described the mansion to be ultra spooky.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
It's ultra spooky.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Spooky.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,040
So, okay, we've got two interesting words here, ultra and spooky.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,320
Now spooky is scary, right?

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,480
It's a little bit scary.

37
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,920
It maybe makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable or maybe it makes you feel a little bit scared.

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Okay, so not very scared.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
Not super scared.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,840
But ultra spooky.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,400
So ultra is another way of saying super or very or really spooky.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,600
So if it's ultra spooky then it's...

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Very scary.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Okay.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,840
All right, so our next word.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,160
They said that in the house there is a ghost haunting the house.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,600
Okay, there is a ghost haunting his house.

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,480
Okay, so the verb to haunt.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,440
Okay, to haunt.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,560
So the ghost is coming to the house frequently and not letting them live in peace.

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,760
When a ghost haunts something, it visits it often and scares it.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Exactly.

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,440
Now, they were all afraid and they didn't want to go in and so Wilma called everyone

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
cowards.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Stop being such cowards.

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Cowards.

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,520
So, a coward.

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,200
A coward is a person that's not brave.

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
A person who's scared of everything.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Exactly.

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
So, they were being cowards.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,320
They were afraid so that's why they didn't want to go in.

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,960
Well, speaking of being afraid, Shabby said, I'm getting goose bumps.

64
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Goose bumps.

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,080
To get goose bumps.

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,240
All right, to get goose bumps.

67
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,840
Now, goose bumps, it may sound a little bit strange but it's very easy when you're scared

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,880
or maybe you're cold, the skin on your arms or on your back, it gets a little bit bumpy.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,360
So your skin looks like chicken skin.

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,240
Exactly, chicken skin and that's actually how we call it in Spanish, chicken skin but

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,480
this is goose bumps so I guess it's kind of similar.

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
A goose.

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,360
Yeah, same idea.

74
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Goose bumps.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
All right and finally, Scruffy said, Shabby is a scaredy cat.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,920
A scaredy cat.

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
A scaredy cat.

78
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,320
You're a scaredy cat.

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Well, a scaredy cat is not really a cat, right?

80
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
No, no, no.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,120
It's a person who's afraid of everything.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Okay.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Similar to a coward.

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
But more informal.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Much more informal.

86
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,240
So somebody is a scaredy cat and I think even a little bit more juvenile.

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
As adults.

88
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
So children use it.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,200
Yeah, as adults, you wouldn't say he's a scaredy cat.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
All right, great.

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,840
So some interesting scary language.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,560
I think we need to hear it one more time slowed down in the dialogue.

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,760
Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,120
It's like ultra spooky.

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
I told you already, Shabby.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,140
The owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

97
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,200
So we have to go in and investigate.

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't like this.

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
Come on, guys.

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
Stop being such cowards.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,480
It's a mystery and an adventure.

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,680
This place gives me the creeps.

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
Seriously, guys.

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,560
Just get out of here.

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,520
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
That laugh came from this room.

108
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,840
Let's go and check it out.

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,920
Look, a ghost.

110
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Run.

111
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,120
Okay, so now that we understand all the vocabulary we saw in language takeaway, why don't we

112
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,920
take a look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder.

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,600
Well, Shabby said we're at this scary looking mansion.

114
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Scary looking mansion.

115
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,440
So a scary looking mansion.

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,560
Okay, so the mansion looks scary.

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
All right, so a mansion is a big house, right?

118
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,600
That looks very scary.

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,480
Now this is a really useful and helpful pattern you can use with English.

120
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Something looking.

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,760
So adjective looking.

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Right, so you can say good looking.

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,120
And there's lots of examples, so why don't we hear a few more now.

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,800
Example one.

125
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,560
That guy is making me nervous.

126
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,760
He's really creepy looking.

127
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Example two.

128
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,160
I saw the craziest looking house today.

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,640
It was built upside down.

130
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Example three.

131
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,040
What a nice looking dog.

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Can I pet him?

133
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,320
All right, great examples, and now we know how we can combine looking with different

134
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
adjectives.

135
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,840
For our next phrase, Shabby said this place gives me the creeps.

136
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,480
All right, gives me the creeps.

137
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,200
To give someone the creeps.

138
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,100
So if something gives you the creeps.

139
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,280
It makes you feel uncomfortable and scared.

140
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
Maybe scared, maybe nervous.

141
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,400
Okay, so why don't we give some examples.

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,720
I could say, hey Marco, see that guy over there?

143
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
He keeps looking at me.

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
He's giving me the creeps.

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Okay, or I can say clowns give me the creeps.

146
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Oh, that's right.

147
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
You're afraid of clowns.

148
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I am afraid of clowns.

149
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
They give me the creeps.

150
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,920
All right, well, it's a really helpful, useful phrase to use when you're talking about being

151
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,200
afraid.

152
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Now why don't we listen to the dialogue one final time?

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,840
Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,200
It's like ultra spooky.

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,960
I told you already shabby.

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,200
The owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

157
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,480
So we have to go in and investigate.

158
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
I don't like this.

159
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Come on guys, stop being such cowards.

160
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
It's a mystery and an adventure.

161
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
This place gives me the creeps.

162
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Seriously guys, let's get out of here.

163
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

164
00:07:45,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

165
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
That laugh came from this room.

166
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Let's go and check it out.

167
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Look, a ghost.

168
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Run.

169
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:29,360
Okay, so an interesting dialogue about ghosts and haunted houses.

170
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
So what do you think, Erica?

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,920
Do you believe in ghosts?

172
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Have you ever seen a ghost?

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,920
No, I totally do not believe in ghosts.

174
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,600
But I understand that you disagree with me.

175
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,960
Well, I've experienced strange things, but I don't know if it was a ghost or an alien.

176
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't know.

177
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
It could have been anything.

178
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
An alien?

179
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
An invisible alien.

180
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay.

181
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
So what happened?

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,760
Well, once I was having dinner with my parents and we had a table and on top of the table,

183
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,680
there was a glass full of water.

184
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,600
And all of a sudden it started to move across the table and then it started to spin while

185
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
it moved.

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
And was there an earthquake or something happening?

187
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
No, nothing.

188
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
We were just, the only thing on the whole table that was moving was that.

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,400
And we all just kind of stared at the glass moving and we didn't know what to do.

190
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,880
And then my mom started kind of giggling a nervous laugh and we really didn't know what

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
happened.

192
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,520
Now, I understand that in Latin America, people are more superstitious.

193
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,560
They believe more in ghosts, right?

194
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Exactly.

195
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
In Latin America, people are very superstitious.

196
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,680
They believe in ghosts or in spirits or we have a lot of urban legends about, you know,

197
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,480
like a leprechaun that lives under a bridge or, you know, somebody's grandma that comes

198
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,120
and haunts them or visits them at night and stuff like that.

199
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,360
So yeah, Latin American people are very superstitious in this sense.

200
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,440
Yeah, I think in Anglo countries, it's a little bit less common to say that you believe in

201
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
ghosts.

202
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,280
Like maybe inside you, you think ghosts are true, but you wouldn't really tell people

203
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
that.

204
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,560
I think the difference would be that you have a different type of superstition.

205
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,600
Like people are afraid of black cats or the floor or the number 13.

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah, or opening your umbrella in a house.

207
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Exactly.

208
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,880
So, because they consider it to be bad luck, but not because something like a ghost or

209
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,920
an alien is going to come out and eat them.

210
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
So listeners, why don't you tell us what you think about ghosts?

211
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,400
Are people superstitious in your country?

212
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,320
Do they believe in ghosts?
