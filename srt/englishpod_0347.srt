00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,220
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,820
And today we're doing something that makes a lot of people very nervous when they come

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,820
to America.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,820
That's right.

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,960
Today we are arriving to the airport, but before we can leave, we need to pass through

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
customs and immigration.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
All right.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Customs and immigration.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,280
So anyone who comes into the United States, American, not American, doesn't matter, you

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,480
have to go through this gate.

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:37,800
So let's learn about some of these phrases and questions in today's dialogue.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Good afternoon.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,440
Passport and arrival card, please.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Here you are.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Where are you coming from?

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
China.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Is this your country of birth or residence?

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,680
I just worked there.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,880
What is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm here on vacation.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,000
How long do you plan to stay in the United States?

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,480
Almost three weeks.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,000
Sir, you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you'll be staying.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, I'm sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,960
States, so I wasn't sure what to put.

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,080
You must specify an address on the place where you will spend most of your time.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,760
Okay.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,960
Here you are.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,480
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you're here?

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,120
Yes, I have some travelers checks and two credit cards.

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,280
Very good.

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,520
Do you have anything to declare?

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Nope.

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,280
I only have my clothes and camera.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Very well, sir.

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
Welcome to the United States.

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Enjoy your visit.

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
All right, we're back.

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,200
So now let's take a look at some of that language takeaway.

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Language takeaway.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,480
The first thing we have to learn about is the arrival card.

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,120
So good afternoon, passport and arrival card, please.

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,080
That's the first line of the dialogue.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
That's right.

47
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,000
So the arrival card, usually you will get on the airplane before you land, and basically

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,760
you just have to put your name, your passport number, where you're from, and basic information

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,440
like this that you must give to the immigration officer.

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Great.

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,240
So what is the opposite of arrival card?

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
What do you fill out when you leave America?

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
That's right.

54
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,000
Some countries require you to fill out a departure card.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,760
So some countries, not all, but you'll usually get an arrival card, which means that you

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,560
have to give your name and basic information.

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
That's right.

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,160
So we are talking to the immigration officer, and he asks, is this your country of birth

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
or residence?

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,960
All right, let's break that down.

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,320
Country of birth.

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,480
So birth, birthday, that makes me think of where I was born.

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,560
So what country were you born in?

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
That's another way to ask this question.

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
That's right.

67
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,840
So since we said we are coming from China, the immigration officer wants to know if we

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,880
are Chinese or if we simply live there, and that's why he says or residence.

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,000
So residence, it's a noun, it's a thing.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,640
My country of residence is the place where I live.

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,800
So I'm American, but maybe my country of residence is France because I live in France.

72
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
That's right.

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,460
So it's different from your country of birth.

74
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,640
Now moving on, when the immigration officer was asking us about money, we said that we

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,840
have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

76
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,640
All right, so credit cards are pretty clear, but what exactly are traveler's checks and

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,180
how are they different from normal checks?

78
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,100
So traveler's checks are kind of a convenient way to carry money because you have these

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,920
little pieces of paper that have a certain amount on them.

80
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,480
So for example, $500 each, and if you lose it, it's not a problem because no one can

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,120
exchange those checks for cash unless it's you.

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,880
All right, so my traveler's check, I buy these from the bank.

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,760
They have my name on them, my passport number on them, and to spend them as money, I need

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,960
to show my passport or proof of identification or proof of identity.

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,520
So basically, if someone steals my traveler's checks, if I lose my traveler's checks, I

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,920
don't have to worry because no one else can spend them but me.

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Exactly.

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,480
They were very, very popular back before credit cards were so popular.

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,680
Now you don't really see too many traveler's checks, but it's still convenient.

90
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,880
All right, so a lot of language there.

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:34,240
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Good afternoon.

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,880
Passport and arrival card, please.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Here you are.

95
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Where are you coming from?

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
China.

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,440
Is this your country of birth or residence?

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,080
I just worked there.

99
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,280
What is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm here on vacation.

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
How long do you plan to stay in the United States?

102
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,920
Almost three weeks.

103
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,400
Sir, you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you'll be staying.

104
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,440
Oh, I'm sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United

105
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,380
States, so I wasn't sure what to put.

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,640
You must specify an address on the place where you will spend most of your time.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,200
Okay.

108
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
Here you are.

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,880
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you're here?

110
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,560
Yes, I have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

111
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
Very good.

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,960
Do you have anything to declare?

113
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Nope.

114
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
I only have my clothes and camera.

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Very well, sir.

116
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,480
Welcome to the United States.

117
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Enjoy your visit.

118
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,160
All right, we're back.

119
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,880
So now let's take a look at some of those key questions that the immigration officer

120
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
asks us on Fluency Builder.

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Fluency Builder.

122
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,600
All right, this first sentence, this first question is actually something that a lot

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,680
of learners of English have a hard time with.

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Where are you coming from?

125
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Right.

126
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,980
So the immigration officer is sitting there at his desk and you are arriving on an airplane.

127
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,720
So what he wants to know is what country are you arriving from?

128
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,560
So if I am on a flight from France to America, I say I'm arriving from France.

129
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm coming from France.

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
That's right.

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,720
But here's a big thing.

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,580
What if he says, where are you from?

133
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,160
Now he's asking you for your nationality.

134
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,860
So then you wouldn't say France because you're not French.

135
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm not French.

136
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
I'm American.

137
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,200
So I'd say I am American, but I'm coming from France.

138
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,240
So this is a very typical question that English learners confuse because as you can see, it's

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,760
very, very similar, but you just have one word that you add on and it completely changes

140
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
the question.

141
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,900
So when the immigration officer asks you, where are you coming from?

142
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,280
You tell them what country you got on the plane.

143
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
All right.

144
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
So where did you leave to come to America?

145
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,280
Did you leave from France, China, Ghana?

146
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,080
So that's the answer to that question.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Exactly.

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,160
Most of the time, immigration officers will never ask you where you are from because they

149
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
will see your passport.

150
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
They know.

151
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
They know.

152
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
So, okay.

153
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,880
Now, once we give them our passport, we tell them that we just work in China.

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,400
We're not Chinese.

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,120
He asks, what is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
What's the purpose of your visit?

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,140
Now purpose means goal or aim.

158
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,600
So there are a couple of standard answers to this question, but basically the immigration

159
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,720
officer wants to know, why are you in America?

160
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,880
Why are you coming here?

161
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
That's right.

162
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,920
So you have, as Catherine says, a couple of different ways of answering that.

163
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,520
We're saying here that we are here on vacation.

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm here on vacation.

165
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Tourism.

166
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Tourism.

167
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Business.

168
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Right.

169
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Seeing family.

170
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,000
These are all acceptable answers.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
That's right.

172
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,760
So now that we've told the officer all of this information, we actually forgot to fill

173
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,080
out our address on our arrival card.

174
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,720
So he says that we must specify an address.

175
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
All right.

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,000
So to specify, this is a verb.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,360
It means to indicate or write down or identify because right now there is no address where

178
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
we're going to stay.

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,400
So to specify means to basically to tell someone where it is, to be exact.

180
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
That's right.

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,240
So you need to specify an address of where you will be during the time you're in the

182
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
United States.

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
It could be a hotel, any place.

184
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Right.

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
But it can't be like Chicago.

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Right.

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
No, it can't be a city.

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
It's got to be an address.

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Address.

190
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,440
So 10 South Street, Chicago, Illinois.

191
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
That's right.

192
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,680
Now we told the immigration officer where we're going to be and he asks a very important

193
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,120
question, also very, very common.

194
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,640
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?

195
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,100
So means in this instance means resources or money.

196
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,240
So do you have enough money to pay for your housing, your food?

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
That's the question.

198
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Right.

199
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,740
So means to support yourself.

200
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,960
That means can you pay for yourself?

201
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
Who's paying for this trip?

202
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Exactly.

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,640
So this is why we say, yeah, we have some traveler's checks and a couple of credit cards.

204
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,320
And lastly, we also need to answer if we have anything to declare.

205
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
But what does this mean?

206
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
To declare what?

207
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
To declare at customs.

208
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Okay.

209
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,760
But we don't normally ask to declare at customs.

210
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,500
We just say, do you have anything to declare?

211
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,200
This is because normally when we travel to other countries, there are special taxes for

212
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,640
certain goods.

213
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,560
For example, if I want to come to America and I have three bottles of wine, I have to

214
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,880
give one away because I'm only allowed to bring in two bottles.

215
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
Right.

216
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,920
So I have to declare two bottles of wine or money.

217
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm only allowed to bring $10,000.

218
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,760
If I bring $15,000, I have to write that down and say, I have this extra money and then

219
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
I pay tax.

220
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,080
So basically they will ask you, what are you bringing to America?

221
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,900
And if there are special things like money or things you will sell or alcohol, cigarettes,

222
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,080
you have to declare these.

223
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,000
You have to explain what you're carrying.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,520
So this is a very important question.

226
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,400
Also most of the time, obviously if you're on tourism, you don't have much to declare,

227
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,640
but maybe like if Catherine says, maybe you are going to buy a house in the United States

228
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,520
and you have $20,000 in your luggage, then you need to tell them that.

229
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
That's right.

230
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,520
So that's called declaring, to declare at customs.

231
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
All right.

232
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:30,960
So let's take a break and listen to our dialogue one last time.

233
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Good afternoon.

234
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,600
Passport and arrival card, please.

235
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Here you are.

236
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Where are you coming from?

237
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
China.

238
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Is this your country of birth or residence?

239
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,800
I just worked there.

240
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,040
What is the purpose of your visit to the United States?

241
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm here on vacation.

242
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,160
How long do you plan to stay in the United States?

243
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,640
Almost three weeks.

244
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,080
Sir, you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you'll be staying.

245
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,160
Oh, I'm sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United

246
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
States, so I wasn't sure what to put.

247
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,400
You must specify an address on the place where you will spend most of your time.

248
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,920
Okay.

249
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
Here you are.

250
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you're here?

251
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
Yes, I have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.

252
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,460
Very good.

253
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,640
Do you have anything to declare?

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Nope.

255
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,480
I only have my clothes and camera.

256
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Very well, sir.

257
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
Welcome to the United States.

258
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,520
Enjoy your visit.

259
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,560
All right.

260
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,920
So when you're arriving to immigration, obviously all these questions are very, very common.

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,100
You will be asked.

262
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,640
But when you're arriving there, there are actually two different sections that you have

263
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
to go to, right?

264
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
That's right.

265
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,000
There's two different lines.

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,920
Maybe many lines, but they'll have a sign on top.

267
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,440
One says US passports or US passport holders, and that means the line for Americans coming

268
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,720
home to America.

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,080
But for most people who are traveling to America, they're foreigners, they have to go to the

270
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
other line.

271
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
So that's non-US passport holders.

272
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
That's right.

273
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,400
Now remember that you don't really have to get nervous when you're talking to the immigration

274
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
officer.

275
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,680
You have to take it easy and just try to answer the questions.

276
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,640
Most of them will speak a couple of words in many popular languages like Chinese or

277
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,200
Spanish or Arabic.

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,280
Because obviously some people that go on holiday to the United States, maybe they don't speak

279
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
English.

280
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
That's right.

281
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
So there's nothing to be worried about.

282
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,180
These people are there to make sure that America is safe.

283
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,600
They want to check the bags.

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
They want to know who's coming into the country.

285
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,840
And they're just doing their job being basically policing the borders.

286
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
But it's pretty simple.

287
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,160
The most annoying part of customs for me is waiting in line.

288
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah, you have so many people arrive at the same time that you can wait in line maybe

289
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
an hour sometimes.

290
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Sometimes.

291
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
So again, just be honest.

292
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,760
And I think people will try to understand you if you're having a hard time.

293
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Exactly.

294
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,460

Bye.
