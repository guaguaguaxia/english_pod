00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,280
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,460
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,520
And today we're bringing you part two of the presidential farewell speech of President

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,520
Eisenhower.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
That's right.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,360
So, we saw in a previous lesson the beginning of this speech.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,760
Now we're going to look towards the end of the speech.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,600
Now, we must tell you as well that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,440
We changed it a little bit to make it a little bit more comprehensible and also we did shorten

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
it.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
We didn't make it this short.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,480
We did take out a lot of stuff.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
All right.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,160
So, again, Marco, why are we looking at this speech?

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
What are we learning from it?

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,680
Well, in this last part of the presidential farewell speech, there are a lot of great

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,760
words that are more difficult and very poetic.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,640
So you can use them in different formal circumstances or just to sound a little bit more well-spoken.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Yeah.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,360
And we also, again, are going to look at some really quite difficult and challenging structures

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:02,120
that we hope you can use maybe when you're giving a formal talk or even in your writing

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,080
if you want to sound quite professional.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Okay.

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Very good.

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,120
So, why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time?

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,320
Let's listen how President Eisenhower says goodbye and then we'll come back and look

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,920
at the words.

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,680
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,920
among great nations.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,980
Three of these involved our own country.

33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,360
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential,

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
and the most productive nation in the world.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,440
We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America's leadership and

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,880
prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength,

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,320
but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,440
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,120
peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,200
among peoples and among nations.

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,800
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations may have their great human needs

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,800
satisfied, that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full, that all

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,960
who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings, that those who have freedom will

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,920
understand also its heavy responsibilities, that all who are insensitive to the needs

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,280
of others will learn charity, that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,320
made to disappear from the earth, and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,480
come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
love.

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,200
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,680
I am proud to do so.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
I look forward to it.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,920
Thank you and good night.

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,800
Well, that certainly was a very moving speech, hey?

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,280
Very moving and to a certain point, a little bit religious, huh?

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,560
Yeah, I think we'll talk a little bit about that a little bit later, but let's concentrate

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,920
on the language now.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,560
So we'll go to Language Takeaway.

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,440
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we'll start with our first word and it's preeminence.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,600
All right, we are understandably proud of this preeminence.

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
A preeminence.

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
So preeminence, what is this?

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
Basically, it's the state of being the leader of something.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,320
Okay, so in this case, America was the preeminent nation.

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,800
Right, so they were coming up, they were very prosperous, so they had a preeminence in the

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
world.

67
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,560
All right, so I think we can see here, you can use this as an adjective, a preeminent

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,280
nation, or as a noun, an uncountable noun, the preeminence of our state.

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Very good.

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,560
Since we can use this word as a noun and an adjective, why don't we listen to some more

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,920
examples so we can get a better understanding of it?

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,600
Example one.

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Now, please welcome Dr. Frank Hicks, the world's most preeminent expert on nuclear biology.

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
Example two.

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,560
He's been a leader in his field for 25 years and his preeminence has never been questioned.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,120
Example three.

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,080
Carol Dixon is one of the most preeminent experts in green technology.

78
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,960
All right, well, Eisenhower was talking about all of the things that the American people

79
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,200
had done since they became a free nation, and one of these things was to foster progress

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,640
in human achievement.

81
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,600
Foster progress in human achievement.

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Well, I like this verb a lot, to foster something.

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,000
So if I say to foster progress or to foster something, what am I saying?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,120
To help something grow and develop.

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,280
To take care of it, to nurse it.

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Yeah.

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,760
And we commonly hear this word associated with children, right?

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
A foster child.

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Yeah.

90
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
So what's that?

91
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,200
If you have a foster child, you are basically taking care of a child because the parents

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,360
can't look after them.

93
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,000
It's not like adopting because you don't actually, it's not actually legal.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
It's just that you're helping somebody out by raising this child.

95
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Right.

96
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,960
So we can see the connection there, a foster child to foster something.

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,280
But you know, this is really a great word and I think it would help to give a couple

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
of examples of how we could use it.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,600
So for example, I can say, our company is looking to foster better creativity in the

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
workplace.

101
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Or we could say, here at Praxis Language, we foster the development of your English.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Very good.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,560
So the word foster.

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,760
Now moving on, in his speech, he was talking about nations and faiths and different types

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,720
of groups and he said, all who yearn for freedom.

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,880
All right.

107
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,120
This is a great phrase.

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,080
All who yearn for freedom.

109
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
To yearn.

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,880
So to yearn for something.

111
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Now if I yearn for freedom or I yearn for something, it's basically that I really want

112
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
it in my heart.

113
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,200
Yeah, you really wish for it in a way that's almost, almost painful.

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,680
You know, you want it so badly.

115
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,760
Now you wouldn't say like, I'm yearning for ice cream, would you?

116
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,400
No, unless you were locked up in prison and hadn't had ice cream for 55 years.

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Exactly.

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,560
So it's usually related to something that's very difficult to get or something like freedom

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,080
or yearning for.

120
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
That's really important.

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Exactly.

122
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Something very important.

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,240
And now for our last word, President Eisenhower was talking about charity.

124
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,840
He was talking about freedom and he mentioned the scourges of poverty.

125
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Okay.

126
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,600
So scourges.

127
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
The scourges of poverty.

128
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,720
Scourges is a really difficult but interesting word.

129
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
So why don't we hear a few more examples to help us understand it.

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Example one.

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,840
Malaria is a disease that continues to be a scourge to the developing world.

132
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Example two.

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,260
One day we hope to eliminate the scourge of cancer.

134
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,640
Example three.

135
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,420
NATO promises to wipe out the scourge of terrorism.

136
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:28,400
So as we can see, the scourges of something basically is the cause of pain or suffering.

137
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,240
So now relating it back to the text, we see scourges of poverty.

138
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Yeah, scourges of poverty, scourges of disease, and scourges of ignorance.

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
All right.

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,880
So we can see that poverty, ignorance, and disease cause a lot of really terrible things,

141
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
right?

142
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Exactly.

143
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
So that's why we say they are scourges.

144
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Okay.

145
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
So scourges.

146
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,760
So that brings us to the end of our words for takeaway today.

147
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,040
But as we talked about earlier, we've got some really difficult and interesting structures

148
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,360
to look at now in Fluency Builder.

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Fluency Builder.

150
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Okay.

151
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,880
So in Fluency Builder, we'll start off with the very first sentence of the paragraph.

152
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,880
When he said, we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century.

153
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Okay.

154
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
So I love this phrase.

155
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,080
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of the century.

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,320
Now it's interesting because he is making reference to the future in the present.

157
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,080
And he's using a great phrase to do that.

158
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,860
We now stand.

159
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,120
Now we can change it a little bit and use the first part, we now stand in different

160
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
circumstances.

161
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,600
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples.

162
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,040
Example one.

163
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,700
We now stand before you to declare our love and be united in marriage.

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,760
Example two.

165
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,440
I stand before this court and declare my innocence.

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,040
Example three.

167
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,960
Together we now stand before this great challenge and we will fight arm in arm to defeat poverty.

168
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Right.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,720
So you can see that this is a wonderful phrase to use maybe in a formal speech, right?

170
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Right.

171
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Or a wedding again or a formal ceremony.

172
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah.

173
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,760
So, and it gives you this idea, this sort of very poetic image of people sort of almost

174
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,520
standing at the cliff, standing before the, you know, some big change that's about to

175
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
take place.

176
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Exactly.

177
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,240
So 10 years past the midpoint of a century, the United States has witnessed four major

178
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,560
wars, right?

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Okay.

180
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,160
And well, he said, despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest,

181
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,360
the most influential and most productive nation in the world.

182
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Okay.

183
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
So a great, great, great structure here.

184
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,640
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America today is the strongest blah, blah, blah, blah,

185
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
blah, blah, blah.

186
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Right.

187
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,240
Now, let's look at that first word, despite the carnage of these conflicts.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Okay.

189
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
So, carnage, what's that?

190
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Carnage is like a massacre, right?

191
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400
Where many people got hurt or killed.

192
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Okay.

193
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,920
So a pretty violent situation when a lot of people died.

194
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,000
And now why does he use this word despite?

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,880
So he's basically saying even though we had all of this death and violence in this century,

197
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,680
we're still the greatest nation, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

198
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Exactly.

199
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
That's exactly it.

200
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,720
I can say, for example, despite the economic crisis the world is going through, our company

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
has an enormous opportunity to grow and be more profitable.

202
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Okay.

203
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,560
Or if we want to take it and imagine we're at a wedding, we might say something like

204
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
this.

205
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,160
You could say, despite the many difficulties this couple has faced, they have a very bright

206
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,040
and happy future together.

207
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Very good.

208
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,200
And now if we take a look at the last paragraph, it's very interesting because it's one sentence.

209
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
It's a really long sentence.

210
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
It's a very long sentence.

211
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,400
So even though it's not a phrase, let's take a look at the punctuation of this paragraph.

212
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Okay.

213
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,040
So Eisenhower starts out by saying, we pray that peoples of all face, all races, all nations

214
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,760
may have their great human needs satisfied.

215
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,400
And then we have a semicolon there, right?

216
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Right.

217
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
So why do we have a semicolon?

218
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,440
Well, here's what he's doing.

219
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,400
He's saying we pray for something.

220
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,480
And then he's listing the many different things that he's praying for.

221
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Okay.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,880
So it's basically a list.

223
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Yep.

224
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Okay.

225
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,400
So we know that when you're writing a list, we commonly use commas between all the things

226
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
that are in this list.

227
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,200
But here, because they are long and complex ideas, a comma is not enough.

228
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You need a semicolon.

229
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Okay.

230
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,400
So we can see here from the text that the semicolon is a great way to separate ideas,

231
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,120
big ideas, complex ideas in a list.

232
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Exactly.

233
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,040
So you can use it and not necessarily have to end your sentence or that each idea become

234
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,200
one sentence.

235
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
You can all just make it one big sentence.

236
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Yep.

237
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,160
You know, and actually I remember back to high school, Marco, my teacher told me, hey,

238
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,680
if you throw in a few semicolons into your writing and do it properly, you'll really

239
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
impress people.

240
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
All right.

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,560
So this is good advice that you can take and throw in a couple of semicolons, a little

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,440
bit of commas here and there, and it'll look like you really know how to write.

243
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Yep.

244
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Okay.

245
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:24,000
So with that in mind, why don't we listen to what Eisenhower wrote one last time.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,800
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars

247
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,020
among great nations.

248
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,880
Three of these involved our own country.

249
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,280
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential

250
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,520
and the most productive nation in the world.

251
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,380
We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America's leadership

252
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:54,160
and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength,

253
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,400
but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

254
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,520
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the

255
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,200
peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity

256
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,320
among peoples and among nations.

257
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,920
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations may have their great human needs

258
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,960
satisfied, that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full, that all

259
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,080
who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings, that those who have freedom will

260
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,040
understand also its heavy responsibilities, that all who are insensitive to the needs

261
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,380
of others will learn charity, that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be

262
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,400
made to disappear from the earth, and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will

263
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,520
come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and

264
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
love.

265
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,280
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

266
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,760
I am proud to do so.

267
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
I look forward to it.

268
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Thank you, and good night.

269
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:10,480
All right, we're back, and we're here again with Pete, our voice actor for the second

270
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
part of the dialogue.

271
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
And Pete, we have a couple more questions for you today.

272
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Cool.

273
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,320
So I hear in Eisenhower's speech that he keeps referencing God.

274
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
Like he keeps saying, I pray, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

275
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
He said God's speed, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

276
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
So what's up with that?

277
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Why is he talking about God?

278
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,240
Well, this is a very interesting question.

279
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,880
Traditionally, America has had a really clear boundary between church and state.

280
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,840
And you'll hear a lot of rhetoric these days that says, you know, we're a Christian nation,

281
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,400
and we were founded as a Christian nation.

282
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Well, that's baloney.

283
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,880
Baloney, so it's not true.

284
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,520
At the time when the country was founded 200 years ago, it was overwhelmingly Christian.

285
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,520
If the founding fathers, as we call them, like George Washington and them, if they had

286
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,880
wanted a Christian nation, they could have had it.

287
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,280
They explicitly did not.

288
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,840
And a lot of people since then have gotten that confused.

289
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:06,160
And now when we have a very large Muslim population, we have Buddhists, we have, you know, people

290
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,480
in all various different kinds of, you know, Mormonism and everything, it's even less possible

291
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
now.

292
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,200
So I'm kind of baffled when I hear people say that America is a Christian nation.

293
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,720
But you even have it now in the coins, like, or on the money, right?

294
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,400
It says in God we trust.

295
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Right.

296
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,440
That started in the early 20th century.

297
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,960
I think that was Teddy Roosevelt era.

298
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
He opposed that.

299
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
Roosevelt was really opposed to that, but...

300
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
And then what happened?

301
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
They approved it.

302
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Yeah.

303
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,960
And, you know, people said later, like Eisenhower talking about this stuff, you know, in America

304
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,280
we have something called the Pledge of Allegiance, which I don't think you guys probably have.

305
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Not in Canada.

306
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,880
Obviously, you wouldn't do it to America, but to your own.

307
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
It's kind of...

308
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,160
Like a salute to the flag, right?

309
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
Yeah, it's a little bit nationalist.

310
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I did it growing up.

311
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,460
You put your hand over your heart and you face the flag and you say, I pledge allegiance

312
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,840
to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one

313
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,220
nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

314
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,500
That part about one nation under God, that was added in the 50s as a kind of a way of

315
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,920
showing that America is not, quote unquote, a godless communist country.

316
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Wow.

317
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, because communism teaches, you know, no religion.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
And so they, make sure we're not communist.

319
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,280
Okay, but we don't think that, right?

320
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Yeah.

321
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
I mean, I'm all about tolerance.

322
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,520
So I think that's kind of absurd.

323
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,120
Okay, so what I think is really interesting, though, is that every political speech, every

324
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,960
time a political leader has to say something publicly, he'll always quote God, right?

325
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Right.

326
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,400
And they'll often end a speech with, you know, thank you and God bless America or something.

327
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Yeah, exactly.

328
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,520
Which, you know what, for me as a Canadian is really strange.

329
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:47,240
Like if a Canadian president said, God bless Canada, everyone would, no one would know

330
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
what to do.

331
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Like, I don't know.

332
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I don't know.

333
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
Anyway, I had an ex-girlfriend who was British and she, like Tony Blair started with that

334
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
a couple times.

335
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,840
He said, you know, and God bless us all or something.

336
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
And she was just put off by it.

337
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,760
And she was like, the Brits will never take this.

338
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
And they didn't.

339
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,440
No one was impressed.

340
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
All right.

341
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,560
Well, an interesting feature of American history, politics and society.

342
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,320
So thanks for that insight, Pete.

343
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Cool.

344
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
My pleasure.

345
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Yeah.

346
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,640
And if you guys have any comments or any suggestions about this lesson or any upcoming lessons,

347
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
just let us know.

348
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Or American politics in general.

349
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,960
I'll try to stop in on the forum and see if I can answer a question or two.

350
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
That would be awesome.

351
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,880
So visit us at EnglishPod.com and Marco, myself and Pete are around to answer your questions.

352
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
All right.

353
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
We'll see you guys there.

354
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.

355
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:49,960
Stay Foreign
