00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,020
And today we're going to be talking about physics.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,020
That's right.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,200
An advanced lesson for all you physics lovers out there.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,560
And even for those of you who maybe don't love physics so much, there's still some great

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
language here.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
Right.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,160
We're going to be talking about the Big Bang Theory, a very popular theory of how the universe

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,440
or the world and how we came upon being created.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
That's right.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,400
So we've got some physics language, but we've also got some really tough words that I bet

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,040
many of our users have never seen before, which we're going to look at those in this

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
lesson.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
All right.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,280
So why don't we get started with this great and interesting lesson.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:53,040
And let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
What's up?

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
You don't look too good.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Yeah, my head hurts.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
That's all.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,520
I've been in physics class all day.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
It's killer.

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,720
I liked physics.

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
It's all math really.

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,680
Arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,240
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
A physics class about the creation of the universe?

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,600
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,080
It sounds more religious to me.

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,800
It's all religion.

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Take the theory of the Big Bang.

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,760
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,040
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
and stuff.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Turtles?

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Whatever.

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,240
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and

41
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,320
antiparticles.

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
At least that's what the math says.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Math?

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Schmath.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's the evidence?

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There is evidence.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,120
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist

48
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,440
to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

49
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,080
What would it be expanding from?

50
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,400
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

51
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,560
Anyway, it's just a theory.

52
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Why do people go around touting theories?

53
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,920
Where's the rigor in that?

54
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,520
Dude, don't equivocate.

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,240
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing.

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,480
You slept through class, didn't you?

57
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
You're making my head hurt again.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,240
Quit with the questions.

59
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,920
Well it sure does sound like a difficult class, doesn't it?

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,840
It's a very interesting topic and very controversial, so there are many opinions on it.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,520
But before we get into that, why don't we take a look at some of those physics-related

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,240
words that we listen to in Language Takeaway.

63
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Language Takeaway.

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,180
We've got four words we've heard in the dialogue that are all related to physics.

65
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,280
So let's start with the first one, which is matter.

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Matter.

67
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Matter.

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,760
Okay, so you probably know this word from what's the matter, what's wrong.

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,680
In this case, we're talking about matter, so anything that occupies space, that has

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,520
a mass or that is related to energy.

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,320
So matter.

72
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,600
So all things in the world are made up of matter, right?

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
Exactly.

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,200
Now let's move on to another one.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Particles.

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Particles.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Particles.

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Now particles are a little bit more, now particles are a little bit easier.

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,720
They're just very small pieces of a whole.

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,640
An apple is made up of apple particles?

81
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Something like that.

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,440
If you want to understand it easily, yeah, apple has many small particles that make up

83
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
the apple.

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,400
So like, let's paint a picture here.

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,080
Imagine you've got a beach and all the pieces of sand are particles of the beach.

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Exactly.

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Very good.

88
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
So those are particles.

89
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,160
Now the next one is a little bit difficult for me.

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
I don't understand this.

91
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Antiparticles.

92
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
All right.

93
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
So antiparticles.

94
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Antiparticles.

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Now this prefix, anti, it means something that is against, right?

96
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Right.

97
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
I've seen this one in anti-clockwise.

98
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,520
All right.

99
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,440
So antiparticles are those that are against particles.

100
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,160
So basically if you have a particle that has a positive charge and another one comes in

101
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,000
with a negative charge in the same weight and the same type of particle, if they get

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,320
together, they cancel each other out and they both die.

103
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,720
So that's an antiparticle.

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
All right.

105
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Well, you heard it first.

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,120
You're at English Pod.

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,080
So antiparticles are not a good thing to have around.

108
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,200
Now we also heard them talk about the drift of matter.

109
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,320
Right.

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,580
Drift of matter.

111
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
Drift of matter.

112
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,360
Also sometimes called drift of dark matter.

113
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Okay.

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,120
Well, I know the verb to drift, right?

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
To sort of float away on the sea.

116
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Right.

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,760
If you have a little ship, you leave it on the beach, it'll drift away.

118
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,280
It'll go slowly away.

119
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Yeah.

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,320
But what about drift of matter?

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,400
So basically the drift of matter is this residue, the remains of the big bang, of the explosion.

122
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Okay.

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,760
So matter and radiation keeps on drifting through the universe.

124
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
So it's moving slowly through the universe.

125
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Moving slowly.

126
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,480
So this big explosion and just consider it to be like this ripple and it's expanding

127
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
and expanding.

128
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
That's the drift of matter.

129
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
All right.

130
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,920
Well, I learned something else today.

131
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,680
Some very specific words related to physics, but it's very interesting.

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
Once you get into reading about these things, it will help you to understand it better.

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
That's right.

134
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,040
But we've also got some non-physics related language that we want to look at now in Language

135
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Takeaway part two.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,280
So they were talking about the drift of matter and how it's drifting through the universe.

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,140
And then he said, thus advancing the notions of an expanding universe.

138
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,320
So I want to look at the phrase, thus advancing notions.

139
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
Thus advancing notions.

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Okay.

141
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,680
Let's start with the first word here.

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Thus.

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Okay.

144
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
So this is a good connector.

145
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Or conjunction.

146
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Or conjunction.

147
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,720
And basically it means.

148
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Therefore.

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
Therefore or in consequence.

150
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Right?

151
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
So thus advancing notions.

152
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,560
Now notions are ideas.

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,760
Right.

154
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,200
And so when you advance notions or advance ideas, you help them make progress.

155
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,040
You help them go forward and become known.

156
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Okay.

157
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,980
So in order to understand this in the context, they are saying that the drift of matter thus

158
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,920
advances notions of an expanding universe.

159
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,280
So it is making progress to people believing that the universe is getting bigger.

160
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay.

161
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
So interesting phrase.

162
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,760
Now, I really like this word thus.

163
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
And a lot of people are afraid to use it.

164
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,320
So why don't we hear a few examples of how it's used in context.

165
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,000
Example one.

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,960
So you can see that we've studied the fossil record and thus we can conclude that evolution

167
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,040
is a fact.

168
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Example two.

169
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,080
He broke severe company policies.

170
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,040
Thus we had to fire him.

171
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Example three.

172
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,880
I did not receive the documents on time.

173
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,760
Thus I was unable to send them to you.

174
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
All right.

175
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Good examples of thus.

176
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,280
And I guess now we can use it a little bit better.

177
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
That's right.

178
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
Now let's move on to our next word.

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,680
So they were talking about people who go around touting theories.

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,320
Tout.

181
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
To tout.

182
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Okay.

183
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
So what does this mean?

184
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Tout.

185
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,500
Well, basically when you tout something, you talk about it in a positive way.

186
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,560
So as to almost like sell that thing.

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,280
So for example, we can say the company is touting the many benefits of its product.

188
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Okay very good.

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
So to talk positively about something.

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,840
Yeah, with the idea of trying to sell that thing or make people buy into it or believe

191
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
it.

192
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
All right.

193
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Very good.

194
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
What about our next word?

195
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,520
Well, we heard two related words in the dialogue.

196
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,680
They were talking about where's the rigor in these theories and rigorous testing.

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,840
Okay, so what's the difference between rigor and rigorous?

198
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,640
Rigor is the state of being very clear and careful and exact.

199
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,840
Okay.

200
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,320
And rigorous is just the adjective.

201
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,840
Clear, careful, attention to detail and exact.

202
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,200
Okay, very good.

203
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
So rigorous training.

204
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm going over my notes in rigorous detail.

205
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
Okay, very good.

206
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,200
And now we have one more word today in language takeaway and that is equivocate.

207
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,000
So we heard dude, don't equivocate.

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,320
Don't equivocate.

209
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Don't equivocate.

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
All right.

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,600
So what does he mean by this?

212
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,520
Well, when you equivocate, you use big words to try and mislead somebody.

213
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Okay.

214
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,400
So using big words to confuse or to mislead.

215
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Yep.

216
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,880
So for example, we could say the job candidate, we could say when asked about his experience,

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,080
the job candidate equivocated.

218
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,800
Okay, or even the presidential nominee did not equivocate when he explained his tax policy.

219
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
All right.

220
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,360
So some good examples, good phrases, a lot of interesting stuff and a little bit more

221
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,280
educational podcast today.

222
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
That's right.

223
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:23,400
So let's continue with our education by listening to the dialogue one last time.

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
What's up?

225
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
You don't look too good.

226
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Yeah, my head hurts.

227
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
That's all.

228
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,880
I've been in physics class all day.

229
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
It's killer.

230
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,080
I liked physics.

231
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
It's all math really.

232
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
Arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.

233
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,600
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

235
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,240
A physics class about the creation of the universe?

236
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

237
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,440
It sounds more religious to me.

238
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,160
It's all religion.

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,560
Take the theory of the Big Bang.

240
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,120
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

241
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,400
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles

242
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
and stuff.

243
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Turtles?

244
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Whatever.

245
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,680
antiparticles.

247
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,360
At least that's what the math says.

248
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Math?

249
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Schmath!

250
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
What's the evidence?

251
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
There is evidence.

252
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,480
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,800
to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

254
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
What would it be expanding from?

255
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,840
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

256
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
Anyway, it's just a theory.

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,800
Why do people go around touting theories?

258
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
Where's the rigor in that?

259
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,880
Dude, don't equivocate.

260
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,600
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing.

261
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,840
You slept through class, didn't you?

262
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,360
You're making my head hurt again.

263
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,280
Quit with the questions.

264
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,400
Alright, so the Big Bang theory, very controversial.

265
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,640
In some schools in the United States, they have prohibited the teachers from teaching

266
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
it.

267
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,560
I know, which seems quite interesting to me.

268
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,160
But it is actually very controversial and people can get really, really upset about

269
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,520
this in America.

270
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,640
So it is an interesting topic.

271
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,960
Take it from the point of view of just something else, maybe just to learn a little bit more

272
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,160
about this topic such as physics, right?

273
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Right.

274
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,840
But there's something that is uncontroversial that I did want to talk about now that we

275
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
heard in the dialogue.

276
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,480
There's a lot of really interesting sort of slang words here in the dialogue, isn't

277
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
there?

278
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,600
We heard it in the first part of the dialogue when he said, I've been in physics class all

279
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
day.

280
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Killer.

281
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Killer.

282
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
So what does he mean by killer?

283
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,840
Oh, he's just basically saying it's really hard.

284
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,560
You know, it's like it's so difficult that it's murderous.

285
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
It was intense.

286
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah.

287
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,320
But this word we can use positively as well, can't we?

288
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,480
Yeah, I guess you could say that was a killer party.

289
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah, killer moves on the dance floor.

290
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay.

291
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,720
Another interesting thing is that he said math schmath.

292
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,760
Now schmath isn't really a word.

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
No, but this is a really common structure we use in English when we want to sort of

294
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,840
take away from the importance of an idea.

295
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Okay.

296
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
So you're saying it's not important.

297
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,480
I don't care about it or it's not worth it.

298
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Yeah.

299
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
So for example, I'm on a diet.

300
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Right.

301
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,760
And I would say diet schmath.

302
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Yeah.

303
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,240
So basically the structure is just added sh and then just kind of make it rhyme.

304
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Yeah.

305
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,440
Schmath or like.

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Like work schmirk.

307
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Yeah.

308
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,720
Work schmirk or something like that.

309
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Yeah.

310
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,520
So you're making fun of it and you're taking away importance.

311
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah.

312
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,680
That's a pretty neat phrase.

313
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,720
And one more.

314
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,680
We heard them say duh.

315
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,960
Duh.

316
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,640
So when we say this, we're just saying like, you should know this, stupid.

317
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Yeah.

318
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
This is obvious.

319
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Yeah.

320
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,200
It's kind of making fun of the person or just saying it's so obvious, how can you not know

321
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
it?

322
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Yeah.

323
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,680
And it always goes either at the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

324
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Yeah.

325
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,800
So duh, Marco, we're recording a podcast.

326
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Right.

327
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Very good.

328
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,000
So some great words and phrases in this dialogue and a little bit of slang as well so you can

329
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
use it maybe with your friends.

330
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
That's right.

331
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,440
If you have any questions about the language in this dialogue or any thoughts on physics

332
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,120
or the Big Bang Theory, come and check out our website at EnglishPod.com.

333
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
All right.

334
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,120
We'll see you guys there and until next time.

335
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Goodbye.

336
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:26,020
Take care, guys.
