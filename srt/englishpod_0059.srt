1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,080
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,160
And today, we're bringing you another great advanced lesson for all those advanced users

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
out there.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
That's right.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,120
This is a really, really useful lesson for all of our advanced users.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Exactly.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,120
You asked for a lesson about job interviews and well, here we are.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,680
We're bringing you the first of three parts of the job interview series.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
All right.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,800
So you said it is the first of three parts.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
So tell me, what are these three parts?

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Okay.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,440
In this lesson, we're going to be looking at preparing for a job interview.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,400
So everything you got to do before the job interview.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,160
Part two will be talking about your education, your background, your work experience.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,020
And in part three, we'll take a look at some of the common questions that are asked at

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,240
a job interview.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,760
And so we'll talk about some great ways to answer these questions.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Exactly.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,160
And these three lessons will be coming out over the next month or so.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Exactly.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,960
So we're going to be looking at part one today.

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,120
So let's take a look at some vocabulary preview.

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Vocabulary preview.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Well, we have three words here in vocabulary preview that you'll hear in the dialogue in

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,200
a moment.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
And the first one is actually not really a word, but an acronym.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Right.

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
CRM.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
CRM.

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
CRM.

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
So Marco, you are our marketing guy.

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,040
Tell us, what is a CRM?

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Well, it's really common in marketing.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,920
It stands for customer relationship management.

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Okay.

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,480
Or customer relation management.

41
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,440
But basically it's the relationship that the company has with its customers.

42
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Okay.

43
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,920
So CRM basically has parts like feedback or customer support, problems that they might

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,360
have, and also information about habits and likes and dislikes from their customers or

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
users.

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay.

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,160
But I commonly hear this word used as a noun.

48
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,760
So something like, can you check in the CRM?

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Right.

50
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,480
There is some software out there that's called the CRM.

51
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:05,280
So SugarCRM or many different softwares, which basically manages your database of customers.

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
Basically software that englobes this whole thing.

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Okay.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Got it.

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
All right.

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Our next phrase in vocabulary preview.

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
Custom designed.

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Custom designed.

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,880
Custom designed.

60
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,160
Custom designed.

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,380
So when something is custom designed, it means it's a special design just for you.

62
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
So it's unique.

63
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
Right.

64
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,600
That's what the word custom means.

65
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Unique.

66
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,000
Like made especially for one person.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Right.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,600
So you have custom designed or also custom made.

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,640
You see that a lot, for example, in cars, right?

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,040
A custom made car.

71
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Yes.

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Or maybe a custom built house.

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
A custom built house.

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Yep.

75
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,600
With your specific likes and dislikes.

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Yeah.

77
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Your requirements.

78
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Yep.

79
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Okay.

80
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
And our last word, core values.

81
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Core values.

82
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Core values.

83
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,200
Core values.

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,720
So the core values of a company.

85
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,200
What does the core mean, actually?

86
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
The center.

87
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
The center, right?

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Yep.

89
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,880
So in here, I think it's like the center or the most important.

90
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,160
The most important things the company believes in, right?

91
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Right.

92
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
So maybe respect for the environment.

93
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Okay.

94
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
Or developing their employees.

95
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Okay.

97
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
So the core values.

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Yep.

99
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
The main things that the company believes in.

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,080
A great phrase for job interviews.

101
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Oh, yes.

102
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Very good phrase.

103
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Okay.

104
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,200
So why don't we listen to a dialogue.

105
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,600
Erica, what exactly is happening?

106
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
All right.

107
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,120
We're going to be listening to two friends.

108
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,040
And this guy is getting ready to go on a job interview.

109
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,600
So his friend is helping him to prepare.

110
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
Okay.

111
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,920
Okay.

112
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,560
So let's go over everything one more time.

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
I really want you to get this job.

114
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I know.

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

116
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
They're true industry leaders.

117
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,800
And it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed

118
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,080
leader in business process platform development.

119
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,920
So let's see.

120
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,160
You did your research on the company, right?

121
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,400
Well, I visited the website and read up on what they do.

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,520
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large

123
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
corporations.

124
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,440
They provide services such as CRM development, and they also offer custom designed applications.

125
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,840
So what would be your role in the company?

126
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,360
Well, the position is for an account manager.

127
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,960
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

128
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Sounds good.

129
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
And so why do you want to work with them?

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,480
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

131
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,640
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees.

132
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,280
And it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

133
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,200
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

134
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,640
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

135
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,720
Oh, and they offer a six week vacation, stock options and bonuses.

136
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm totally going to cash in on that.

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
You idiot.

138
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
You don't say that.

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Do you want this job or not?

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:05,440
All right, so he was doing great, but in the end, he said something he shouldn't, right?

141
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,680
Yeah, I don't think talking about money as your primary motivation for coming on to a

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,960
new company is really the way to go.

143
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Yeah, and we're going to talk about that a little bit later, but let's take a look real

144
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,080
quick at some language takeaway.

145
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Language takeaway.

146
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,460
All right, in this lesson, we have five key words for you from the dialogue, which we

147
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,520
hope that you will remember.

148
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
Let's take a look at the first one.

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Undisputed.

150
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Undisputed.

151
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Undisputed.

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Undisputed.

153
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,360
So, this is kind of a strange word.

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,640
Let's listen to some examples before we explain it.

155
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,440
Example one.

156
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,080
It's undisputed that she's the best person for the job.

157
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,600
Example two.

158
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,700
The undisputed truth is that unemployment is rising.

159
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,160
No one doubts that.

160
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,920
Example three.

161
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,720
She's the undisputed champion of the world.

162
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,040
Well, I can understand from these examples that it means there is no doubt.

163
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
There is no doubt.

164
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
There's no question.

165
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Okay, now let's take a look at our second word, growth opportunity.

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Growth opportunity.

167
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,800
It's a great growth opportunity.

168
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,200
So it's an excellent chance to improve, right?

169
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,520
To improve professionally and also on a personal side, right?

170
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Yeah.

171
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,040
So, when we talk about growth opportunities, we can also use the phrase a development opportunity.

172
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
And it's the same thing, right?

173
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Yeah.

174
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
To develop, to grow.

175
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,520
To improve yourself.

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Okay.

177
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,240
Now, let's take a look at our third word, read up.

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
Read up.

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,440
Read up.

180
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Read up.

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,560
So, when you read up on something.

182
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,400
Well, obviously, you read it, right?

183
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Right.

184
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,720
But you're reading it specifically for some information so you can know more about the

185
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
subject.

186
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,040
So, it's kind of similar to study, right?

187
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Kind of.

188
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,240
But really with the idea that you're trying to improve your knowledge about a particular

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
field.

190
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay.

191
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Now, for our fourth word, unleash potential.

192
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,360
Unleash potential.

193
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,640
Unleash potential.

194
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Unleash potential.

195
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Okay.

196
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
So, to unleash.

197
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
All right.

198
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,080
Well, I'm going to paint a picture for you.

199
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
All right.

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,640
So, imagine you have your dog, right?

201
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,160
And your dog is walking on a leash.

202
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,360
Like it has a string or a rope attached to it.

203
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Right.

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
So, then when you undo the leash, you unleash the dog.

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
And then what happens?

206
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
It goes around and it's running.

207
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
It's going everywhere.

209
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,880
So, if you unleash potential, you release it and let it go and help it grow and become

210
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
bigger.

211
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes.

212
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Exactly.

213
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
So, you give it freedom.

214
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,960
So, potential is the capabilities or abilities that a person has, right?

215
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
Yes.

216
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
To do something great.

217
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Okay.

218
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Unleash potential.

219
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,520
This, I think, is an excellent word to use in a job interview.

220
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
I think it is really descriptive and really powerful.

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Yeah, it is.

222
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah.

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
It's a good word.

224
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Okay.

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,120
So, let's go to the last one now.

226
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,760
Resonate with.

227
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Resonate with.

228
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Resonate with.

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Resonate with.

230
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,120
So, he mentioned, this really resonated with me.

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,080
So, what does he mean by resonated?

232
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,440
I guess he means it connected to him, right?

233
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,600
It touched him.

234
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,720
So, he agrees with this idea or he feels that he can relate to it.

235
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Yeah, exactly.

236
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
You know what?

237
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,800
I think this one needs a few examples to really show its meaning.

238
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Okay.

239
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,120
Let's listen.

240
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Example 1.

241
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:49,920
The candidate's speech really resonated with the voters.

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,440
Example 2.

243
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Their music doesn't really resonate with me.

244
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,040
Example 3.

245
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,000
Their commitment to fight global warming resonates with me.

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,400
All right.

247
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,120
So, it's clear now to resonate with, right?

248
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Okay.

249
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,560
So, why don't we go and listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back

250
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:33,960
and give you some great pointers about preparing for a job interview.

251
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,240
Okay.

252
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,400
So let's go over everything one more time.

253
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
I really want you to get this job.

254
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I know.

255
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

256
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,640
They're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization

257
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,960
that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

258
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,800
So let's see.

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,080
You did your research on the company, right?

260
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,280
Well, I visited the website and read up on what they do.

261
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,320
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large

262
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,400
corporations.

263
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,320
They provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom designed applications.

264
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,720
So what would be your role in the company?

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,220
Well, the position is for an account manager.

266
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,800
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Sounds good.

268
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,840
And so why do you want to work with them?

269
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,320
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

270
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,480
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees,

271
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,120
and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

272
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,040
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

273
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,400
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

274
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, and they offer six weeks vacation, stock options and bonuses.

275
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm totally going to cash in on that.

276
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
You idiot.

277
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
You don't say that.

278
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,400
Do you want this job or not?

279
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:06,160
OK, so preparing for a job interview is really important, right?

280
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Yes.

281
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Yeah.

282
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,160
And we're going to give you some really basic tips about how you can prepare for a job interview.

283
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Yeah.

284
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I got to confess something to you, Marco.

285
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
What?

286
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,840
I love job interviews.

287
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Really?

288
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,120
Yeah, I know it's really weird.

289
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,840
Most people hate them, but I love them.

290
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,960
So you love being the interviewer or going to job interviews?

291
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Both.

292
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Really?

293
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Yeah.

294
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I like everything about them.

295
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,560
So I feel like I have a lot of passion to share with you about this.

296
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
All right.

297
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,620
So let's take a look at the first point or the first tip that you can help us out with.

298
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,200
So before you go to a job interview, you should do a little bit of research, right?

299
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Right.

300
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,460
And that's our first point.

301
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,880
It's really important to know as much as you can about the company, their history, their

302
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,280
product, their management style, just as much information as you can find out about how

303
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,920
they work and what they do.

304
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,560
And why do you think this is important?

305
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,680
Well basically, you'll be asked about it in the interview.

306
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Right.

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,520
And so if you show that you haven't prepared, you haven't done any research, you show that

308
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
you don't care.

309
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,320
One of the best ways that you can impress in a job interview is to show that you know

310
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,760
about the company, important things like you know what kind of products they offer or what's

311
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,600
their largest market.

312
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,920
And I guess that really impresses the interviewer because it shows that you are interested in

313
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,040
this company and they really want the job.

314
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,800
And that you are willing to do the extra work it takes to prepare yourself.

315
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,120
Because I think that will show the interviewer that later on when you're working for them,

316
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,200
you'll do that extra work on the job.

317
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Exactly.

318
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
That's a really good point.

319
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,840
So that's our first point, our first tip, to do some research.

320
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Yes.

321
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Now you've done your research.

322
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
You know everything about the company.

323
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
What else should you do?

324
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,600
Once you've read up on the company, you've got to spend some time thinking about yourself.

325
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,080
You've got to prepare to sell yourself to the company.

326
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,040
So to sell yourself, to really demonstrate them why you are the perfect person for the

327
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
job.

328
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Right.

329
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,360
Because a lot of people think about why they want to work for the company, right?

330
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,680
Because they feel like they're aligned with the core values or the message of the company

331
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
resonates with them.

332
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,080
But what the interviewer really wants to hear is how you, the interviewee, is going to benefit

333
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
the company.

334
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
What are you going to bring to the company?

335
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Right.

336
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,000
And this is the most important part, is to know what are your skills, right?

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes.

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,440
And it's not enough to just say, well, I am a great leader.

339
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Yeah.

340
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Right.

341
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
So if you are a great leader, you should be ready to give an example of how you have demonstrated

342
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
to be a great leader.

343
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes.

344
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All right.

345
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,280
So maybe like an example like, I'm a really strong leader because in my previous job,

346
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,920
I had the best JD Power ratings for employee satisfaction.

347
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Okay.

348
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,560
So you're actually showing with numbers or with facts that you are a great leader.

349
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah.

350
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
So the key thing here, I think, is identify what your strengths and skills are.

351
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,540
Think of specific examples.

352
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,680
If you can, give numbers and show how you can bring this skill and your experiences

353
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
to the new company.

354
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
And now, well, you're ready to sell yourself.

355
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,260
You've done your research.

356
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,160
Now you have all of these things in your mind.

357
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
You have to practice.

358
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Yes.

359
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Right.

360
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,080
A much overlooked stage in the preparation.

361
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Yeah.

362
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
A lot of people think it through.

363
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
They write things down, but don't really practice.

364
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah.

365
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,400
So I know you have a few tips about how you can practice interviewing effectively.

366
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Okay.

367
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,600
Well, the first thing that you should do is use your friends.

368
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Yeah.

369
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Right.

370
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
They got to be good for something.

371
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Exactly.

372
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,160
And well, probably your friends are also working at a company.

373
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,360
Maybe they're managers, or maybe they've interviewed someone before already.

374
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,720
So you can set up a mini interview and have them pretend that they are the interviewer

375
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,120
and ask you these questions.

376
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,040
And you're trying to answer seriously.

377
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,640
And I'm sure that your friends can give you some great feedback.

378
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,440
Maybe what you did right, maybe what you did wrong.

379
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
So that's a really good way.

380
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,440
And another thing is also you can record yourself.

381
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Yes.

382
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Right.

383
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Yeah.

384
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,640
If you have a video camera or even a web, I mean, many people have a webcam like right

385
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,960
in your laptop.

386
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,320
Record yourself actually doing the practice interview with your friends.

387
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,760
And this is really useful because you can later see what you recorded and detect some

388
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,360
of the things that maybe aren't really useful or good.

389
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,280
You know, for example, posture is a really important aspect.

390
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
So what do you mean posture?

391
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,160
So the way that you are sitting down in your seat.

392
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Yep.

393
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
And how you are expressing yourself with your hands.

394
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Yep.

395
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,960
Some people, you know, they move a lot during the interview because of course you're nervous.

396
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,480
So maybe they're moving from side to side or playing with their feet or playing with

397
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,960
something on the table or moving their hands in an awkward way.

398
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
So those are the things that you have to watch out for.

399
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Yes.

400
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,880
So I guess it's really important to sit up straight and to show that you are powerful

401
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,400
and in control.

402
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,840
And another really great thing is eye contact, right?

403
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Yeah.

404
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Yeah.

405
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
We were talking about this earlier.

406
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,400
And why is eye contact so important?

407
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,960
If an interviewee maintains eye contact with me for like most of the interview, I feel

408
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,040
like they have really good people skills.

409
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,600
In my opinion, I would say they have a lot of self-confidence.

410
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Yeah, I'd agree.

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Right?

412
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Yep.

413
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,120
Because if a person is looking down or not looking directly at you, it's either one of

414
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,480
two things in my opinion.

415
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,360
It's either they are not confident enough with themselves or they are lying to you.

416
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Yes.

417
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Right?

418
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Yeah.

419
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Or also they just they don't have good people skills.

420
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Yeah.

421
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Yeah.

422
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,560
Which is a problem in today's sort of knowledge-based economy.

423
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Exactly.

424
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,360
So it's really important to maintain eye contact.

425
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,640
And one other really important thing related to eye contact posture is the handshake.

426
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,440
When you get to the interview, it's really, really important to give a firm, good handshake.

427
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,360
So what qualifies as a firm, good handshake?

428
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
Well, you don't have to prove that you are ultra strong, right?

429
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,320
So you don't have to squeeze the other person's hand really hard.

430
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,560
And like break their hand.

431
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Exactly.

432
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,880
It's not like a strength contest.

433
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
No.

434
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,160
A good firm handshake is squeezing normally, not too tight, not too loose, but your entire

435
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,320
palm, your entire hand has to be in contact with the other person's palm or hand.

436
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Yes.

437
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,720
Don't give them the fingers, you know, like some people give you only four fingers or

438
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
half their hand.

439
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Yeah.

440
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
I hate that.

441
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I hate it too.

442
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,480
And this goes for men and for women because a lot of women do this.

443
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Yeah.

444
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,320
I call this the dead fish handshake.

445
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,000
It is kind of like a dead fish or the dead hand handshake.

446
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

447
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,720
I absolutely agree with you on this one.

448
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
So nice firm handshake.

449
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah.

450
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,240
So that's the dead fish handshake and well, these are our tips for preparing for the interview,

451
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
everything you have to do before it.

452
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,240

I'd love to hear it because like I told you, I love job interviews.

456
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
