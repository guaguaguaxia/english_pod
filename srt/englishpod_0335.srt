00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine and we're going to have some fun today, Marco, right?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right. Today we are taking a small kid and we're going to the park and we're going to play.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so there are fun things you can do at the park. We're going to learn all about them. Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, honey. Where were you?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How was it? Were there a lot of kids?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time. We got on the seesaw together, then went on a couple of different slides,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sounds like fun. When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, but today he was really hyper. He even got onto the monkey bars. And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour. I'm exhausted.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All right, we're back. So now let's take a look at some of this great playground equipment on Language Takeaway.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, as you said, Marco, today we're focusing in Language Takeaway on some of these things you can do at the park.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, the first one is one of my personal favorites from childhood called the seesaw.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The seesaw, that's right. And so basically it's that long piece of, well, sometimes metal or wood, and two people sit at each opposite end.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, and so when one person goes down, the other person goes up. And when that person goes down, the other person goes up. So it's a seesaw.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right. So yes, it's actually a very common toy that you can play with at the playground.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But also another very common one I'm sure everyone knows and has been on is a slide.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A slide. Now this is a bit hard to describe actually. Slides are usually quite colorful.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But they're like tubes that are open and the child can go down. So you're on top, maybe two meters high, and then you go down the slide and you come down to the ground.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right. And actually it's the noun, a slide, but what you do is, the verb is you actually slide down the slide.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, and sometimes you go very fast and it's scary.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right. And well, if you want to have something a little bit less scary, you can go into the jungle gym.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, jungle. Now the jungle is actually a place. In South America, for example, you have jungles with lots of trees and monkeys and everything.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But jungle gym is like many, many different metal bars or wood together to make this open structure that boys and girls can climb on.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So basically you start on the ground and you climb all the way up it.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, so I think this is why it's called a kind of like a jungle gym, right? Because you can climb up and down and grab all these bars.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can hang like a monkey from the bars.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Exactly.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, so basically it's just a cage that boys and girls can climb on and play with.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right, and I guess you call it a jungle gym because when you're doing all this, you're doing exercise.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right, so now maybe for the smaller kids who just want to play with some toys, they can just hang out at the sandbox.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right, this is one word, but it's actually quite literal. You'd have sand in a box.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And a sandbox is very safe and very fun because boys and girls can make castles or dig, but there's nothing to it really. It's just a box.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's just a box with sand, literally. Yes, that's right. So that's also fun for the smaller kids to be at the sandbox.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, going back to something very similar to the jungle gym, we have the monkey bars.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, now monkey bars are a very important part of the park. These are horizontal bars, so they're across.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And you hang on them with your arms, so your body hangs down. And when you hang, your feet are off the ground.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's very tall.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And you have to move. You have to change from one bar to the other. So it's like a ladder that you're pulling yourself across.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, exactly. So you've probably seen it exactly how you describe it. It's a ladder, and you just got to hang on to the different bars with your arms.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's actually quite difficult to do.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I always used to get upset because I couldn't go all the way across because you go from one end to the other end.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But my arms would get so tired that I had to drop down onto the ground.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Really? All right. Well, something that's a little bit less exhausting but also very fun are when you go on the swings.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All right. Swings are great. Now, swings are kind of like chairs, but they don't have a back.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So you sit down on a piece that's maybe plastic, and someone behind you will push you because you're on these hanging chairs.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And they'll push you, and you go forward and backward. And you can go very, very high, and then you come back down.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Exactly. So these are swings. All of this equipment you've most likely seen at any of the parks that are nearby.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But we're going to post some pictures as well so you can see more clearly what they're all about.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, let's go and review the dialogue again before we move on to Fluency Builder.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Sounds like fun. When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, but today he was really hyper. He even got under the monkey bars. And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour. I'm exhausted.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
All right. We're back. So now let's take a look at three phrases on Fluency Builder.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So our first phrase today is actually something that the parent is talking about. She wants to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now, what does it mean to go get fresh air?

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, basically, it means to go out and maybe walk or just be outside and get air from the outside.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because sometimes you're in your house all the time, and that's not fresh air.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's right. So basically, this means exactly what you're saying. It means going outside.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So kids often need to go get some fresh air, but also adults do, too.

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sometimes I feel like when I'm working in the office for a long time, I really need to get some fresh air.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So that means I go outside for a walk.

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Exactly. And you can tell your friends, oh, excuse me for a minute. I'm going to go get some fresh air.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Or you know what? You're looking a little bit pale. Maybe you should go get some fresh air.

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Exactly. And talking about all this great equipment and how much fun you can have, the wife said, wow, that sounds like fun.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay. So sounds like fun. It's not actually a sound.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This phrase is really important because we say it a lot, but it actually just means that it sounds like it will be a fun time.

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Right.

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or I think it will be fun.

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah. So from what you're telling me, I think it's fun.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right. So we can say this about a lot of things. I could say, hey, Marco, we're going to go play some football after work. Do you want to come?

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sure. That sounds like fun.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
All right. So he thinks it sounds like a good idea. He'll probably come, right?

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Exactly. So if something sounds like fun. All right. And moving on to our last phrase,

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
we said that it was a great idea that we're going to the park and getting fresh air because we don't go to the gym anymore.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay. Now this is a really important phrase to keep as a phrase. First of all, we have a gym. What do you do at a gym, Marco?

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, you work out.

83
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah. You exercise. Maybe you run on the treadmill or you lift weights.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But it's important to remember that the verb here is to go to the gym.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So I could say I go to the gym three times a week. How often do you go to the gym?

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay. So that's the phrase. You go to the gym.

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I stop going to the gym and I gain a little weight.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay. So that's the way you use it. You don't use any other verb when you're talking about the gym. You say you go to the gym.

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I go to the gym. He goes to the gym regularly.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right. Very good. So that's all the Fluency Builder for today. Let's review our dialogue one last time.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hey, honey. Where were you?

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How was it? Were there a lot of kids?

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We got on the seesaw together, then went on a couple of different slides, and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Sounds like fun. When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah, but today he was really hyper. He even got under the monkey bars.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour. I'm exhausted.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore.

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
All right. So growing up, there are many, many different games at parks that you can probably find, especially now you have such great playground equipment.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I think these are the most basic ones that everyone knows about.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's right. These are pretty standard things that you'll see at a playground.

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Remember that a park doesn't have to have these things.

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Parks are just public places, maybe with benches and trees.

105
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But a playground is the part of the park where you'll see these kinds of things like a slide or swings.

106
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And so it's important to remember that they're not the same.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right. And now, did you ever have a bad accident or did you fall off the swing or the seesaw or maybe you fell off the slide?

108
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, I fell all the time.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Never a serious accident, but swings, I liked to swing.

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And when I was forward, you know, up in the air, I used to let go and jump.

111
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You would jump off the swing.

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I would jump off the swing. So when you're very high in the air, it feels like you're flying for a minute.

113
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My mother hated it because she thought I was going to break my arms.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I loved it.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's great fun. And actually, we would really like to know, maybe you have some pictures that you can share with us of some specific playground equipment that we may have missed.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There are a lot of things out there and maybe locally there are even some more fun things that we don't have.

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So let us know what do playgrounds look like in your country.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We hope to see you at EnglishPod.com.

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All right. We'll see you guys there.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Bye.
