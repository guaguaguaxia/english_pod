00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,400
My name is Katherine and today we've got a great informative lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
That's right.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
We are going to talk about an emergency situation.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,480
So what do you do when you have an emergency?

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
You dial 911.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Exactly.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,120
Alright, well maybe not in your country but today we're talking about emergencies in America

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,180
and jobs.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,560
So people who can help you in an emergency.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,600
So before we get into those words and phrases, let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,840
Alright class, now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,880
I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic and a lifeguard.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,440
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
They save people from bad things.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
That's right.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,900
Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,900
you would call?

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,900
911.

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,900
Yes!

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,400
You would pick up the phone and dial 911.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,160
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 911?

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,520
If my grandpa had a heart attack, if there was an accident, if a robber broke into the

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
house, if the fire alarm went off.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,680
I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,920
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,640
the garlic bread as usual.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Alright we're back.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,960
So now we have a couple of different jobs for people that are working specifically in

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,680
emergency situations.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,160
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,400
Alright, so we have a teacher in today's dialogue who's talking to her students about

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
jobs.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,160
Now obviously these students are very young and she says another word that means jobs.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,480
What's the word she uses?

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Professions.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Professions.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
That's the plural.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,720
So profession is a job.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,880
Let's say for example a lawyer is a profession.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Or a doctor.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,940
A doctor, a lawyer.

45
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,320
So what's your profession is another way to ask what's your job.

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Alright, so they're talking about professions and some of the kids dressed up as different

47
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
people.

48
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,280
So the first one was a fireman.

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
A fireman.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,240
So you know the first word fire.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,600
A fireman is a person who puts out a fire.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,560
That means he uses water to stop a fire.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Very good.

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,920
So a fireman puts out fires.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,440
Now apart from a fireman we also have a police officer.

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
A police officer.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,520
So an officer is someone who works in an official capacity.

58
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,580
So in a job.

59
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,320
So we could say he is a police officer or a policeman or a policewoman.

60
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,120
So three ways to say this.

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,240
So officer is for both genders, right?

62
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,760
A man or a woman could be a police officer.

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
That's right.

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,940
So you're going to hear this very often because policeman doesn't explain a woman police officer.

65
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,360
So we use police officer to be general.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
So we have a fireman, a police officer, a medic.

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,440
Now what is this medic?

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,040
A medic is a kind of doctor, someone who will look at your health or help you if you've

69
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,160
hurt yourself, who usually works on the road like driving to an accident or driving to

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,760
a fire with police officers.

71
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,760
So these people help police officers and firemen when there's an emergency.

72
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Okay.

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,640
So a medic is not really a doctor.

74
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,200
He's more of a specific person that can help you if you have maybe some cuts or bruises

75
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
or will help you out.

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Right.

77
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,920
So they will stop your bleeding or will help take you to the hospital and they'll make

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
sure that you're healthy when you get to the hospital.

79
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,320
But they are not really like a doctor where you work in a hospital or a doctor's office.

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Okay.

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,040
And our last profession is a lifeguard.

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
Well think about these two words.

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,360
We have life and we have guard.

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Guard is like protect.

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
So a person that protects your life.

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Hmm, interesting.

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,680
Well this is someone who usually works at the beach or at a pool.

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,040
They have a special chair and usually they have a cross on their bathing suit or on their

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,080
towel and this means that they're going to help protect people who are at the beach.

90
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,640
So if someone can't swim, the lifeguard will run or swim to get them and save them.

91
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,720
Okay, very good.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,580
So you have a lifeguard.

93
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,520
Now this is for men and women as well, right?

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
A lifeguard.

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Exactly.

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Okay.

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
So interesting professions.

98
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:36,480
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

99
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,040
Alright class, now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,320
Ah, I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic and a lifeguard.

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,240
They save people from bad things.

103
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
That's right.

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,320
Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number

105
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,720
you would call?

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
911.

107
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes.

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,760
You would pick up the phone and dial 911.

109
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,560
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 911?

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
If my grandpa had a heart attack.

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
If there was an accident.

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,120
If a robber broke into the house.

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,920
If the fire alarm went off.

114
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,060
I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

115
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,280
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,080
the garlic bread as usual.

117
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,640
Alright, we're back so now let's start with Fluency Builder.

118
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,440
Fluency Builder.

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,680
Our first item in Fluency Builder we've already talked about.

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,280
The number in America to call when you have an emergency is 911.

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,640
So we usually say, hey, dial 911.

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,280
Okay, so that's a verb there, to dial.

123
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Exactly.

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,760
To dial means to select the numbers for a phone call.

125
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,040
To telephone someone.

126
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,920
To telephone someone, to dial.

127
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,360
So you can dial 911 or dial my office number.

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,000
Or I tried to dial your home number but no one answered.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,320
Now you can call 911 for many different situations or emergency.

131
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,760
One of the kids said, well, if my grandpa had a heart attack.

132
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,680
Okay, so this is an example of an emergency.

133
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,880
A heart attack is a medical problem.

134
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,120
It's when your heart cannot receive oxygen.

135
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,040
Okay, so your heart stops beating sometimes.

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
That's right.

137
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Sorry.

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,320
It's when your heart does not receive enough blood or oxygen.

139
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,080
So it's when your heart stops beating.

140
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,480
Okay, very good.

141
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,280
So that's a heart attack.

142
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Now another possible emergency situation is if the fire alarm goes off.

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,120
This often happens in office buildings and schools.

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,720
So you hear a dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
or some kind of strange noise.

146
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,720
Well that's because there's maybe a fire or some smoke in your building.

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,000
And so usually when this sound goes off, it automatically calls the police and the fire

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
department.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Now there's an interesting phrasal verb that is used along with this word fire alarm.

151
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,260
We say the fire alarm goes off or the fire alarm went off.

152
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,160
So that means it started to sound, to emit a sound.

153
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,160
So the verb here, as you said it's a phrasal verb, is to go off.

154
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,760
We could say my alarm went off.

155
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,200
Or every morning at 7 o'clock my alarm goes off.

156
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,280
Okay, that means your alarm begins to make a sound.

157
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,840
A very annoying sound.

158
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,080
You know, it's the worst sound ever.

159
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
But a lot of things can go off.

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,560
We could talk about a bell or an alarm.

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Or fireworks.

162
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Or fireworks go off.

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,840
And well, the last emergency that we were talking about is if a robber broke into the

164
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
house.

165
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,560
So if a robber breaks in.

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
To break into.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,920
This means to enter, to go inside without permission or without a key.

168
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Illegally.

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Illegally.

170
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,480
So you don't have to break something but usually you break a window or a door.

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,520
But this means that someone comes into your house looking to steal something.

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,320
So usually you have to use force.

173
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,000
For example, if I forget my keys inside my car and I have to break into my own car, that

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,480
means maybe I have to force the door open or maybe break the window.

175
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Yeah, it's not fun.

176
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,040
I think it usually ends up being very expensive.

177
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
Yes, it does.

178
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,880
Alright, so those are all the phrases we have for today.

179
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:38,400
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time.

180
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,920
Alright class, now that we're all dressed up, let's see what professions you chose.

181
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,280
Ah, I see a fireman, a police officer, a medic and a lifeguard.

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

183
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,240
They save people from bad things.

184
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
That's right.

185
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,300
Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what phone number

186
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,720
you would call?

187
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
911.

188
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes.

189
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,760
You would pick up the phone and dial 911.

190
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,560
What are some emergency situations in which you would need to dial 911?

191
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,840
If my grandpa had a heart attack.

192
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
If there was an accident.

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,120
If a robber broke into the house.

194
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,920
If the fire alarm went off.

195
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,040
I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house.

196
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,320
The only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper and my mom burns

197
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:32,280
the garlic bread as usual.

198
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,120
So Marco, when you were a kid and your teacher said, what jobs are there, what professions

199
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,600
are there, what profession would you like, what did you answer?

200
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,400
I always wanted to be a pilot.

201
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Oh, pilot.

202
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
So you wanted to fly airplanes.

203
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I wanted to be a jet pilot.

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,120
Actually I collected books about it, I read up about it, so even till now I probably still

205
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,920
remember like the capacity of certain jets or what types of weapons they have.

206
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
I was really, really into it.

207
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,320
Wow, I never knew this about you.

208
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,240
Yeah, what about you?

209
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,160
I could never decide as a kid.

210
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,040
I remember we had to draw pictures of what I will look like in 20 years and everyone

211
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,280
had these pictures, I will be a doctor, I'll be a veterinarian, I'll be the president.

212
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,400
I never knew what to draw, so I think I copied my friend, she wanted to be a lawyer.

213
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I was like, okay, that sounds okay.

214
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,200
Yeah, I think it's hard and usually what you want to be as a kid, you don't do it when

215
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
you're older.

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,080
Yeah, it's because of my vision, I didn't have 20-20 vision to actually join the Air

217
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Force.

218
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,960
Well, and a lot of kids don't know how many jobs there are out there.

219
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,320
You know the big ones, doctor, lawyer, fireman, policeman, astronaut.

220
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
So I guess the question for you is what's your profession?

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Tell us about it, especially if it's one of the less famous professions out there, because

222
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,240
there's a lot that I don't know about those.

223
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Our website is EnglishPod.com, we hope to see you there and until next time.

224
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Bye.

225
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,760
We hope to see you there.
