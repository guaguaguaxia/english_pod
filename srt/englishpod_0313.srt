00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
And as you know, we've had a series going about small talk in English.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,480
So today's lesson is a part of that series.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
That's right.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,080
Today we're going to listen to two friends, two girlfriends meeting and they haven't seen

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,480
each other for a long time.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,440
So we're just going to see how they quickly have a small conversation.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,680
Hey Michelle, is that you?

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,120
Wow, Grace, long time no see.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Where have you been?

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,920
Oh yeah, well, you see I got a promotion so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
You did?

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Congratulations.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,200
Thanks a lot.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
So how are things with you, Michelle?

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,240
Well, same old, same old, you know, nothing much has changed here.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Are you still seeing Chris?

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,400
No, actually we split up last month.

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,640
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,120
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,800
So well, let's just wait and see.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,120
Good for you, Michelle.

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,280
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,240
So now let's take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,640
Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,760
So the first word we have here today, Marco, is the word promotion.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,520
Grace says, well, you see, I got a promotion so I moved to the new Pudong office.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
That's right.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,700
So she got a promotion and a promotion is work related.

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,160
That means that you got a better position.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
That's right.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
But you didn't change companies.

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,600
So in your company, you had a job and you did well in that job.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,800
And so your boss gave you a better job in the company.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,120
And that's a promotion.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
That's right.

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
Okay, so she got a promotion.

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,400
Grace, when they were talking about work and now they started talking about their personal

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,320
life and Grace asked if Michelle is still seeing Chris.

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,640
Okay, so the verb here is to see someone, to be seeing someone.

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
We're not actually talking about eyes and looking.

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
We're talking about dating.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
That's right.

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,760
So if you're seeing Chris, it means you are dating Chris.

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Okay.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,720
So that's an interesting way of describing a relationship.

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,000
So you say, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm seeing someone.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't date you.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm seeing someone else.

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,920
Or you could ask someone, are you seeing anyone right now?

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
That means are you dating anyone?

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you have a boyfriend basically?

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,840
And sadly, no, they are not together anymore.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,080
She says, actually, we split up last month.

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
All right.

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,480
So this is another relationship term.

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,840
To split up means to break up or to stop dating.

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,880
To stop seeing each other.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,960
So there are two ways of seeing it, as you said, to split up or to break up.

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
That's right.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,720
So unfortunately, they split up or unfortunately, they broke up.

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,240
They are no longer seeing each other.

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
That's right.

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Okay.

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,440
But she said she had some good news because she met a really cute guy at a networking

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
party.

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
What is networking?

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
All right.

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,400
So networking is something that you do, especially in the business world.

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,720
You go to events, parties, happy hours, and you meet people.

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,680
You meet strangers and you talk about work and you try to meet as many people as you

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
can.

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Okay.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,760
So it's not really a social party to actually just go and meet random people.

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,200
You're trying to meet people that will be interesting for your business or maybe to

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
get some other ideas.

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,720
It's for a business purpose.

81
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
That's right.

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,040
So perhaps in your town, you own a small business and your town has decided to have a chamber

83
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,120
of commerce networking party.

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,720
So you can meet other small business owners.

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Okay.

86
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Very good.

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,680
So that's what we have for language takeaway.

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,320
Let's go back and listen to our dialogue for the second time.

89
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,600
Hey, Michelle.

90
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,000
Is that you?

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Wow, Grace.

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,280
Long time no see.

93
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Where have you been?

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Oh yeah.

95
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, you see, I got a promotion so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

96
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
You did?

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Congratulations.

98
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
Thanks a lot.

99
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,680
So how are things with you, Michelle?

100
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,360
Well, same old, same old, you know, nothing much has changed here.

101
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,880
Are you still seeing Chris?

102
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,600
No, actually we split up last month.

103
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh dear.

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm sorry to hear that.

105
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,200
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party.

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,720
So well, let's just wait and see.

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,800
Good for you, Michelle.

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
All right.

109
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,920
Let's talk about these small, quick but very useful phrases for small talk on Fluency Builder.

110
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,280
Fluency Builder.

111
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,560
So this first phrase is a phrase that you'll hear a lot when people greet each other but

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,400
perhaps friends who haven't seen each other in a very long time.

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,560
We use this phrase, long time no see.

114
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
That's right.

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,480
Now, you look at it and it may seem like it's incorrect, right?

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Because you're missing something.

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
That's right.

118
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Long time no see.

119
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Who no see?

120
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
What long time?

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
That's right.

122
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,800
But this actually means I haven't seen you in a long time.

123
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
That's right.

124
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,160
So the phrase is long time no see.

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
Hey, Michelle, long time no see.

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,760
How are you?

127
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,080
That's the way that you use it.

128
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,880
But just take it as a phrase.

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,440
Don't try to analyze it too much.

130
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
So hey, Marco, long time no see.

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
That's right.

132
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Okay.

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,000
And well, they're talking and she's like, well, how are you?

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,040
And she says, well, you know, same old, same old.

135
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
All right.

136
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
This is another one.

137
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
It doesn't look right.

138
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
It doesn't look wrong.

139
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,600
But we do say this and twice, same old, same old.

140
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
And this means nothing has changed.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,640
There's nothing really new in my life.

142
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Right.

143
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,160
The same old things in my life.

144
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,040
Nothing really new or exciting.

145
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Same old.

146
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Exactly.

147
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,960
So I could say, hey, Marco, how's the job going?

148
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,440
You know, same old, same old.

149
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
All right.

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
So nothing has changed in his job.

151
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,640
He has not gotten a promotion.

152
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
That's right.

153
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,000
So now, Michelle was again describing about the guy that she met at the networking party

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,600
and she said, well, let's just wait and see.

155
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,000
It seems like an incomplete sentence because let's wait and see what.

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All right.

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
So let's wait and see what?

158
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
That's the question, though.

159
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
You know, what are we waiting to see?

160
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Well, she's basically saying we don't know how things will go, but we, you know, we'll

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,960
have to wait for the future to come before we can make a decision or figure out what's

162
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
going on.

163
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
That's right.

164
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,600
So, for example, Marco, we're at the office and I say, how is that report coming along?

165
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Is it, you know, were the numbers good?

166
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,800
And I can say, yeah, the numbers seemed all right, but we'll just wait and see.

167
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,440
Perhaps we don't have all the numbers yet, so we have to wait to get the rest of them.

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
That's right.

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,800
So you're just basically saying I don't know what will happen in the future.

170
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,040
Let's just hope that it will be good and let's see what happens.

171
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
Let's just wait and see.

172
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Let's just wait and see.

173
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
All right.

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:10,840
Let's go back and listen to our dialogue one last time.

175
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:38,000
And

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
guy last night at a networking party.

177
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
So well, let's just wait and see.

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,160
Good for you, Michelle.

179
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,180
Okay so this was another part of our small talk series.

180
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,360
As you see, very useful and quick little phrases so you can have a very brief conversation

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,120
with maybe someone you haven't seen or a little chit chat at the office.

182
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,560
That's right and these are things that if you remember them, you memorize them, you

183
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
can use in almost any conversation.

184
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,220
Also I'm sorry to hear that or good for you.

185
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,720
These are really great phrases that are very, very flexible.

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
That's right.

187
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,880
Actually that's a really good one.

188
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm sorry to hear that.

189
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe someone gives you a little bit of bad news or something bad happened in their life.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,840
It's very polite and a nice way of saying hey, I understand.

191
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,700
I'm sorry to hear that.

192
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
That's right.

193
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,400
So we hope that you've learned something new in today's lesson.
