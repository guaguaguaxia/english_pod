00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we have an elementary lesson for you and we are at the supermarket.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,500
We're at the grocery store and we're going to learn some language you can use when you

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,280
want to pay for your groceries.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,200
So this lesson was requested by one of our users that wanted vocabulary and different

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,840
phrases that are used in the supermarket when the person is about to pay for all the things

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
they need.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
That's right.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,120
And we also have some great language that the person who is actually selling the groceries

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
can use.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
All right.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:52,640
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what happens.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,240
Excuse me, sir.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the express checkout lane for people who have 15 items or fewer.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,320
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, come on.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,880
I have 16 items.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,960
Cut me some slack, will you?

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Fine.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:18,280
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,400
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Plastic.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,960
I also have a couple of coupons.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
No problem.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,760
I'll take those.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,480
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Darn.

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,040
Oh, well, I guess it's just not my day.

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Thanks anyway.

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,120
Yeah, I got a club card.

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
Here you go.

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,440
Will this be debit or credit?

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Debit, please.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
Also, can I get cash back?

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,080
$50 would be great.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,880
Yeah, sure.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Your total is $78.33.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Here's your receipt.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Have a nice day.

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:09,840
Well, we can see in this dialogue that the guy was able to buy his food and, you know,

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,480
they were using some really interesting, helpful language.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
That's right.

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,480
So why don't we look at this language now in Language Takeaway.

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Language Takeaway.

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,760
Okay, we have six words for you today.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,240
And the first one, the girl, the cashier says, this is the express checkout lane.

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,560
All right, so checkout lane.

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,240
The checkout lane.

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,560
So the checkout lane is the place where you get in line to pay for all the goods you bought.

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,400
Right, so the checkout lane.

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Now, why did she say express checkout lane?

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,880
So in grocery stores or in supermarkets, sometimes you have a specific checkout lane that's faster.

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Okay.

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,400
Because people have less things.

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,920
So express is the faster checkout lane.

61
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
Right, the faster one.

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,040
All right, so next she tells the guy to put your items on the belt.

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Okay, the belt.

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
The belt.

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
A belt.

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,840
So you think about belt as the thing you put around your waist.

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,360
To keep your pants up.

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,760
Right, but in a supermarket, the belt is the moving table that you put your groceries on

69
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,400
so the cashier starts to pass them through.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,080
Okay, so the belt.

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,360
Okay, the belt.

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,520
Put your groceries on the belt.

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,160
And then the guy said that he had a couple of coupons.

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Coupons.

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Coupons.

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
A coupon.

77
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Okay, so what is a coupon?

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,920
A coupon is a piece of paper you can use to get a discount.

79
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,720
All right, so it has a discount on it.

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,920
A discount for one thing.

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,320
So maybe you buy some apples and you get 10% off one kind of apple.

82
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,080
Very good, coupons.

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,680
Now he presented these coupons and she said they were expired.

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,040
The coupons expired yesterday.

85
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Expired.

86
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
To expire.

87
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,600
All right, so to expire.

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,040
That means to be older than the date when you can use them.

89
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,920
Right, so why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use expired so we can

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,760
understand a little bit better.

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,280
Example one.

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,740
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,180
This credit card expired five years ago.

94
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,600
You can't use it anymore.

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,360
Example two.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,240
My driver's license expires in a month, so I have to get it renewed.

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Example three.

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Don't drink that.

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
The milk has expired.

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,280
Okay, so we can see his coupons expired, so they were too old and he couldn't use them

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
anymore.

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Exactly.

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,200
And now, finally, she asked him if he wants to pay with his club card or cash.

104
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,320
So club card.

105
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Club card.

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,480
What's a club card?

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,960
So in some supermarkets, you can receive a special type of credit card that you can only

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,680
use for grocery shopping.

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
And only in that store.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Right.

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
So that is a club card.

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,440
All right, so a club card.

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,120
Okay, so he's going to pay with a card, but he also asked for some cash back.

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Cash back.

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,640
Could I get cash back?

116
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Cash back.

117
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Now, what's he talking about?

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Can he get cash back?

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
He's paying with a card.

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,760
What does he want to do?

121
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,600
Well, what happens is sometimes, suppose your groceries cost $20.

122
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,560
So instead of charging $20 to your credit card or your club card, you say, okay, put

123
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,200
$70.

124
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,980
So then the cashier can give you $50 back.

125
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,920
So you can have cash in your pocket.

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,720
So instead of going to the ATM, you can get your money in one spot.

127
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Exactly.

128
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
All right.

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
So that's cash back.

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Interesting.

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,920
We're going to hear this one more time in the dialogue, but let's slow it down a little

132
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,760
so we can understand better.

133
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,280
Excuse me, sir.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,800
This is the express checkout lane for people that have 15 items or fewer.

135
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,880
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,200
Oh, come on.

137
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,120
I have 16 items.

138
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Get me some slack, will you?

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Fine.

140
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,800
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

141
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Plastic.

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,440
I also have a couple of coupons.

144
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
No problem.

145
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll take those.

146
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,800
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

147
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Darn.

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
Oh, well, I guess it's just not my day.

149
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,560
Thanks, anyway.

150
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,920
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,680
Yeah, I got a club card.

152
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,160
Here you go.

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,840
Will this be debit or credit?

154
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Debit, please.

155
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,480
Also, can I get cash back?

156
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,720
$50 would be great.

157
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,640
Yeah, sure.

158
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,200
Your total is $78.33.

159
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,560
Here is your receipt.

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Have a nice day.

161
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,960
Thank you.

162
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
All right.

163
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,000
So now that we've listened to the dialogue for the second time, it's time for us to take

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,880
a look at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

165
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Fluency Builder.

166
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Okay, we have three phrases for you now.

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,920
Well, the guy was not having a very good day, was he?

168
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,360
So he couldn't go in the express checkout lane and he says, cut me some slack.

169
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,640
Cut me some slack.

170
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,880
To cut someone some slack.

171
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
All right.

172
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,640
Now, this is an interesting and very informal phrase.

173
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,880
So before we explain it, why don't we listen to a couple of other examples?

174
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,680
Example one.

175
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Cut me some slack.

176
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm only two minutes late.

177
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,040
Example two.

178
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,480
My wife just had a baby and I'm so tired.

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
Cut me some slack.

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I'll send you the report tomorrow.

181
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,760
Example three.

182
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,680
Emily had a really bad week.

183
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,760
I think you should cut her some slack.

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay, I think I can understand it means relax the rules a little bit.

185
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Right.

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
So don't be so strict on me.

187
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
Yeah, don't be so hard.

188
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,000
Now, I know this phrase actually comes from mountain climbing.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
Oh, because of the rope.

190
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Yeah.

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,200
So it's just, it's like saying the slack is loose rope.

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
So he's just saying, give me a little bit more freedom.

193
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Give me more freedom.

194
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Oh, interesting.

195
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Yep.

196
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
To cut somebody some slack.

197
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,120
Well, now the cashier asked him a question.

198
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,480
She says, do you prefer paper or plastic?

199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,440
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

200
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Paper or plastic.

201
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,080
Now, this is the common cliche phrase that any grocery store cashier will use, right?

202
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Yeah.

203
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Paper or plastic what?

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Bags.

205
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Paper or plastic bags.

206
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
All right.

207
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,560
So you'll hear this all the time in every grocery store.

208
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
Do you want paper or plastic?

209
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Right.

210
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,840
So you can choose plastic bags or paper bags.

211
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Okay.

212
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,440
Remember this one because when you get it right, you'll sound really native-like.

213
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
Very good.

214
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,480
And our last phrase, since he wasn't really having a good day, he said, it's just not

215
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
my day.

216
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,420
It's just not my day.

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
It's not my day.

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,440
Okay, so when it's not your day, it means the day has been hard.

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,600
You've not really lucky.

220
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Yeah.

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,080
It's not a good day for you.

222
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Not a good day.

223
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
All right.

224
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,960
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

225
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:14,120
bit about grocery stores in America.

226
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,760
Excuse me, sir.

227
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,520
This is the express checkout lane for people that have 15 items or fewer.

228
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,840
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Oh, come on.

230
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,400
I have 16 items.

231
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,440
Cut me some slack, will you?

232
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Fine.

233
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:39,800
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

234
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Plastic.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,440
I also have a couple of coupons.

237
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
No problem.

238
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll take those.

239
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Darn.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh, well, I guess it's just not my day.

242
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Thanks anyway.

243
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,080
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

244
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,560
Yeah, I got a club card.

245
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
Here you go.

246
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,920
Will this be debit or credit?

247
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Debit please.

248
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,960
Also, can I get cash back?

249
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
$50 would be great.

250
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah, sure.

251
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,640
Your total is $78.33.

252
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Here's your receipt.

253
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:27,520
Have a nice day.

254
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,360
One interesting thing I know about grocery stores in America is that the people who are

255
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,720
the cashiers are very often students.

256
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Right.

257
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,600
It's a very popular summer job or part-time job of college students.

258
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,040
Or even in my hometown, it was the most common job for high school students.

259
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,560
After school, if you went to the grocery store between 4 o'clock and 9 o'clock at night,

260
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,040
every single cashier would be a high school student.

261
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,760
And the interesting thing is that the cashiers are usually women, right?

262
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,580
Yeah, always the high school girls who are the cashiers.

263
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,000
And so the high school boys would be working in the back, maybe in the warehouse carrying

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,220
boxes or stocking the shelves.

265
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,480
So putting the cans on the shelves, right?

266
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Exactly.

267
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,160
It's a very popular part-time job for students in the United States, but also coupons are

268
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,280
very popular in America.

269
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Yeah.

270
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,080
What is it about coupons?

271
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Well, usually, for example, in the Sunday newspaper, you will receive a lot of coupons.

272
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
You go to the grocery store and you have all these coupons for like cookies or a promotion

273
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
on some type of soda or drink.

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,040
So it's very popular.

275
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,880
People go grocery shopping and then present all these coupons.

276
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,400
And actually, you can end up saving a good amount of money.

277
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I know the coupons are usually like, save two cents or save 25 cents.

278
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,880
But I guess if you put all of those together, you can save money.

279
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,400
It's interesting because people actually will buy that product just because they have a

280
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,520
coupon for it.

281
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,600
Coupons and high school checkout girls.

282
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
