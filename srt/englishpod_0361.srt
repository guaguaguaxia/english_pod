00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,960
My name is Catherine and today we're talking a little bit about food and about your health.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
That's right.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,680
Today we're going to take a look at our favorite maybe kind of food.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,840
We're taking a look at the fast food, all these yummy but not very healthy types of

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,840
food.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
Yeah, we are.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,140
So let's listen to our dialogue and when we come back we'll be talking about what some

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:34,640
of these foods are and what some of the phrases you've heard mean.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm hungry.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,400
Let's order up something to eat.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Okay.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,440
Maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,660
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,360
You eat too much junk food.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,240
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,480
Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,180
It's not only about getting fat or not, it's about being healthy.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,440
You could really have some health problems later on.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,640
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,080
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,320
You're a lost cause.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,440
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,400
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,820
Language takeaway.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,680
So first up on language takeaway is a very unhealthy food.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,720
It's called a chocolate sundae.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
That's right.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,680
We wanted to order hamburger, french fries and a chocolate sundae.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,280
So chocolate we know that this is the flavor that comes from cocoa.

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,200
But what is a sundae?

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,680
Well basically a sundae is a kind of ice cream dessert.

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,640
It comes in a cup or a bowl and it's usually vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,360
then oftentimes a cherry on top.

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,200
So as you can see the word is pronounced exactly like the day, sundae, but it has a different

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
spelling in the end.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,400
S-U-N-D-A-E, sundae.

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,940
So this is a chocolate sundae.

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,240
So when you see this spelling, a sundae with an E, that's the dessert.

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,560
If you see it with a Y, that's the day.

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Exactly.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,360
So chocolate sundae, actually a very delicious dessert, but remember it's ice cream.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
That's right.

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,040
And all of these types of food, hamburger, chocolate sundae, it's called junk food.

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Junk food.

47
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Well food you know.

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Junk.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
What is an example of junk, Marco?

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,640
Well something that's not good or useful anymore.

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,320
So maybe you have trash that you need to get rid of, like an old TV.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,440
That's junk.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,240
So my mom would always say, throw away this junk.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,580
It's stuff that you don't need.

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,120
So junk is things that you would throw away.

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,320
Junk food is the kind of food that's not healthy for you.

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,800
It's the food that you shouldn't eat, but it tends to be really delicious.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
That's right.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,680
So for example, the hamburger, french fries, a chocolate sundae, all this would fall under

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,520
this category of junk food.

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
That's right.

62
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,800
And one of the things about junk food is that it's high in cholesterol.

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Now what is cholesterol, Marco?

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
That's right.

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
So you always have to be careful.

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,120
Your doctor says that you shouldn't have or you have to be careful about having high cholesterol.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,680
And that's just basically, it's a type of fat that is found in animal products.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,560
So for example, beef has cholesterol and it's dangerous because it could maybe cause health

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
problems.

70
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
That's right.

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,000
So my friend needed to lower his cholesterol and his doctor told him he should eat less

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,880
red meat, eat more vegetables and fruits instead.

73
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
That's right.

74
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,560
So cholesterol is a, you'll see it all the time when you're shopping.

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,040
You'll see that it's low in cholesterol or no sugar or no calories, stuff like that.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Exactly.

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Now, a food that is very, very high in cholesterol is fried chicken, but it's also very delicious.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
That's right.

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Fried chicken.

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,540
Now as you see, the first word there is fried and that means that it was cooked in hot oil.

81
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,540
That's right.

82
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,440
And what's important to remember about most American fried chicken is that the chicken

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:18,000
is usually put in a batter, so like a milk, egg, flour sauce, and then it's fried.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,700
So on the outside it's very, very crispy and salty.

85
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
That's right.

86
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,480
So it's covered in like a type of bread, like a crispy bread.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah, that's right.

88
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,440
It's usually very greasy, so when you eat it, you have lots of grease on your fingers.

89
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,200
But one of the reasons it tastes so good is because as you say, Marco, it's fried in oil.

90
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
That's right.

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Very good.

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,560
So this is all the vocab that we have for language takeaway.

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:53,080
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

94
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm hungry.

95
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
Let's order up something to eat.

96
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Okay, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

97
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,200
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries, and a chocolate sundae.

98
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,880
You eat too much junk food.

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,240
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

100
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, I never seem to gain weight, so I don't mind.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
It's not only about getting fat or not, it's about being healthy.

102
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
You could really have some health problems later on.

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

104
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,560
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,080
You're a lost cause.

106
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,320
All right, now it's time for some phrases on Fluency Builder.

107
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Fluency Builder

108
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,520
So one of the first phrases is actually something that I'm excited to talk about because it

109
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,560
comes up a lot in directions when we're giving people directions somewhere.

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,520
So one of the people in the dialogue said, we can order a soup and salad from the restaurant

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,040
down the street.

112
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Right.

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,000
So this is, you're basically telling the person where the restaurant is.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,600
And when you say something is down the street, it means that it's nearby.

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
It is.

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
It's nearby.

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,720
It's on the same street or it's just a few minutes walk from where you are now.

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Right, right.

119
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,280
So you can say, my apartment is just down the street from this park.

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,320
So it's very close.

121
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,440
Or you could say, I know him.

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
He lived down the street from me when we were children.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,160
Okay, so he lived really, really close to you.

124
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Very good.

125
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,520
Now, when we were talking about junk food and we were talking about how it's not healthy,

126
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,840
we said that junk food clogs up your arteries.

127
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,080
All right.

128
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,920
A couple important words here to clog up arteries.

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,880
The verb to clog, what does that mean?

130
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Clog with a G. It means it gets in the way or obstructs it.

131
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
All right.

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,440
So for example, if a drain, in my sink, if a drain is clogged, the water does not go

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
down.

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Right.

135
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,840
So the water starts to build and build and build.

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,080
Actually, it's very dangerous because if it comes up too much, the water will go on the

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,640
floor.

138
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,600
But that's a drain, that's a sink.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,760
If you're talking about the heart, you would say that cholesterol clogs up your arteries.

140
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Right.

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,800
So your arteries are like these tubes where blood passes.

142
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,520
And of course, if they're clogged up, then blood can't pass.

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
That's right.

144
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,880
And if it's very serious, people sometimes have to have heart surgery to clear those

145
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,360
arteries to take the blockage, the clogging away from the arteries.

146
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
That's right.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
That's right.

148
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Okay.

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,840
So that is to clog something up or something is clogged up.

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Now moving on, when we were giving suggestions, we said, all right, well, how about pizza

151
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,600
or maybe some fried chicken?

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

153
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
All right.

154
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,240
Now this is a great phrase, as you say, Marco, for offering a suggestion.

155
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,840
You could say, I think we should eat hamburgers.

156
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Better yet.

157
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Okay.

158
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
So what does this mean?

159
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,000
This means I actually had a better idea while I was telling you my other idea.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,080
So it can be used in the middle of a sentence like here, right?

161
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,720
It's kind of like an interjection.

162
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,520
Better yet, you know what?

163
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
Let's get some pizza.

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,640
So it's better than the idea you just had.

165
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Right.

166
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,080
So let's go swimming.

167
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,120
Better yet, let's go play basketball.

168
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Right.

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Exactly.

170
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,520
So towards the end, our friend said, you know what?

171
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,720
You're a lost cause.

172
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
What does that mean?

173
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
What does this phrase mean?

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
You're a lost cause.

175
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
You're a lost cause.

176
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,600
It's an interesting phrase.

177
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,200
This is basically a way of saying I can do nothing to change you.

178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,080
You have a bad habit or you have this bad quality and anything I do, it's not going

179
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
to help.

180
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Right.

181
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,640
So something that is a lost cause, it means it's hopeless, helpless.

182
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
That's right.

183
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
I cannot do anything to change it.

184
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay.

185
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
All right.

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
A lot of great vocab here.

187
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,600
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm hungry.

189
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Let's order up something to eat.

190
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay.

191
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
Maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.

192
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,640
I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae.

193
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,360
You eat too much junk food.

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,240
That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.

195
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,480
Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind.

196
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,200
It's not only about getting fat or not.

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,140
It's about being healthy.

198
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,200
You could really have some health problems later on.

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken?

200
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Better yet, let's order some hot dogs.

201
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,480
You're a lost cause.

202
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,260
All right.

203
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,960
So talking about junk food, we took a look at cholesterol.

204
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,080
Now apparently not all cholesterol is bad.

205
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
That's right.

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,440
There are two kinds of cholesterol, HDLs and LDLs.

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,040
One kind is good for you and the other kind is bad for you.

208
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,040
So it's important when you talk to your doctor, you ask your doctor if the bad cholesterol

209
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
is high for you.

210
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,040
Because if it's the good cholesterol that's high, you're probably not going to experience

211
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
health problems.

212
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,080
But if you have really high bad cholesterol, then that's something that you should think

213
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,080
about when you eat and when you choose the kinds of foods that you eat.

214
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,840
So usually, my doctor always used to tell me to not eat so many eggs because eggs are

215
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
high in cholesterol.

216
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
That's right.

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,360
Red meat and eggs and salty foods I think.

218
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,240
But generally speaking, I think it's good just to eat a lot of vegetables and to balance

219
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,580
out your diet.

220
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,560
So vegetables don't really even have cholesterol.

221
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
No.

222
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,760
They have high cholesterol and I think they also have a lot of vitamins and minerals that

223
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,840
your body needs.

224
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,600
It's very, very interesting because actually all food that is usually very, very delicious

225
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,160
is high in cholesterol or high in calories.

226
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
It's bad for you.

227
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
It's basically junk food.

228
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Yeah.

229
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,280
So potato chips, hot dogs, pizza, fried chicken, all of these delicious foods, they're all

230
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,320
considered junk food and they're all really bad for you.

231
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
That's right.

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
So that's a very interesting topic.

233
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Now there are certain local types of junk food that people consider to be junk food.

234
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,080
Like for example, if you go maybe to the Middle East, you'll have the wraps, right?

235
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
That could be considered a type of junk food.

236
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
I guess.

237
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Yeah.

238
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Because it's fast, it's greasy.

239
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
It is pretty greasy.

240
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,000
All this delicious, like a shawarma wrap.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Exactly.

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,200
So maybe you can let us know what local type of junk food you have.

243
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,920
This is mostly American, burgers, fries, hot dogs.

244
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Exactly.

245
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,240
What is it in your country?

246
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,000
Let us know, our website is EnglishPod.com.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000

248

Okay, bye.
