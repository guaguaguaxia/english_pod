00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,240
My name is Katherine and this is our 300th lesson here at EnglishPod, so it's a special

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
lesson.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,920
But today we're talking a little bit about dating.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
That's right.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,200
Today we're going to talk about dating now in a little bit of a less conventional way,

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,440
a new type of dating, very modern with using technology.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,740
Using technology, that's right.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,360
So let's listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,040
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,760
Oh, I can't.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,400
I have a date.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Really?

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Wow.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
With who?

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,080
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,040
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,440
Wait a minute.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,440
You mean you met her online?

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Yeah.

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,720
I signed up for a website called match.com and it's great.

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,400
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
pets.

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,840
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,600
That's kind of weird.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,440
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,960
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,400
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,540
I guess it does seem logical.

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,080
I'll have to check it out.

33
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
All right.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
We're back.

35
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,880
Now, let's take a look at some of these key words that we've picked out for you on Language

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,240
Takeaway.

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,120
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,760
The first word is a word that you're going to hear English speakers say all the time,

39
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,440
especially if they're Americans.

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,120
Cool is our first word.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,880
This guy described this girl that he is seeing as really cool.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
She's really cool.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,640
What does that mean if I describe someone as a cool person?

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,400
A cool person is someone who you like.

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,800
It's a good thing.

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,440
Someone who is cool, I think of as relaxed and interesting and someone who maybe has

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,480
lots of ideas or things to say.

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,160
If you say that a person is cool, you're saying that you like that person.

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
What if you say something is cool, like Paris is really cool?

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,000
Paris is cool.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a cool city.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
That means it's an interesting city.

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
It's something that you like.

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
Maybe you're trying to recommend someone to go there.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,840
You can also say that movie was really cool.

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,520
So again, it means you liked it.

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Yeah.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Okay.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,440
So talking about dating, this friend was a bit surprised when he said that he met this

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
girl online.

61
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
That's right.

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,640
So online, where is this place online?

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
It's in cyberspace.

64
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
All right.

65
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
So online means on the internet.

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,920
And we often use this when describing things.

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,120
So EnglishPod is an online English learning site.

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
That's right.

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,320
So anything that is in the internet, in cyberspace, you say that is online.

70
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,240
So our website is online.

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,720
Or maybe you have pictures online.

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,960
I have many photographs online.

73
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,920
Or I like to meet people online.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Okay.

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,360
So continuing on, we talked about a website that obviously that's online where you find

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,420
people and talking about preferences.

77
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,560
You mentioned that you can state whether you are a smoker or if you have pets.

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
So what is a person that's a smoker?

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,440
Well, many of you have probably heard the term to smoke before.

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,520
I smoke cigarettes.

81
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,740
I smoke.

82
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,800
But a smoker is a person who smokes cigarettes.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,980
And so I could say that I want a non-smoker if I'm looking for a boyfriend.

84
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,520
Because I don't want someone who smokes.

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,920
But maybe if you do smoke, you can say I'm looking for a smoker, someone who does smoke.

86
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Okay.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,360
So Jen was a little bit concerned saying, well, that's weird.

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,800
What if this girl is a psycho or something like that?

89
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
All right.

90
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
A psycho.

91
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,560
Now, maybe you've heard of the movie Psycho.

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,400
But psycho is something that we use in English to say that someone is really crazy, almost

93
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,920
scary crazy.

94
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,320
It comes from the word psychopath, right?

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
That's right.

96
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,120
And a psychopath is someone who is crazy but also very dangerous.

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Right.

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,380
So obviously when we use this word, we're describing someone as being a little bit strange

99
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,560
or maybe even a little bit dangerous.

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
That's right.

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,920
So we don't want any psychos to come and talk to us online, right?

102
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
That's right.

103
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,800
So he went on to explain how dating is just the same online as it is offline.

104
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,080
And that he thinks it's a really cool alternative, even if you're shy.

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,720
So something is an alternative if you have different options.

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,820
Maybe dating by going to a bar and meeting someone is what normal people do.

107
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,320
But an alternative to that would be dating online.

108
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
That's right.

109
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
It's another option.

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,040
So the word alternative is a second option, another option.

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Right.

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,360
For example, if I want to go have Italian food tonight, but you don't want to, I'd say,

113
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Hey, Marco, well, can you give me an alternative idea?

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,760
That is the other option.

115
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
All right.

116
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Great.

117
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,840
So a lot of words in this very interesting dialogue.

118
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Stay with us.

119
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:13,920
We'll be right back where we'll take a look at Fluency Builder.

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Oh, I can't.

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
I have a date.

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Really?

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Wow.

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
With who?

126
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,400
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
She's really cool.

128
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,320
And she's driving over here this weekend.

129
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
Wait a minute.

130
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,680
You mean you met her online?

131
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Yeah.

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,040
I signed up for a website called Match.com and it's great.

133
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,720
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
pets.

135
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,000
And then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
chat.

137
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,960
That's kind of weird.

138
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,800
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,320
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

140
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,120
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,760
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

142
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,920
I guess it does seem logical.

143
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll have to check it out.

144
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,000
All right, we're back and we've picked out five key phrases for you.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Let's check those out on Fluency Builder.

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Fluency Builder.

147
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,880
All right, the first phrase we've got here is one that we often use in English, spoken

148
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,200
English to talk about seeing our friends.

149
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,820
Okay, so the first person says, do you want to hang out tomorrow?

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
To hang out.

151
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
That's right.

152
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
So let's hang out.

153
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
We never hang out anymore.

154
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
What does that mean?

155
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,320
Well, to hang out is it's hard to define because you can do many things when you're hanging

156
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
out.

157
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,840
But basically it means friends being together.

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,480
So watching a movie, listening to music, chatting, these are all examples of hanging out.

159
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,760
So maybe if you get together with your friend, just sit in the living room and talk, you're

160
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
hanging out.

161
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
That's right.

162
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,580
Or you could go drive a car together and you're hanging out, you're talking.

163
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,520
So to hang out is to be social, is to talk to your friends.

164
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
To spend time together.

165
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,360
And he said, wait, oh, I can't because I have a date.

166
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,560
Okay, to have a date.

167
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,560
So a date is a romantic appointment with someone that you want to go out with.

168
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
But you have a date.

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
This is something you have.

170
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,220
I have a date that night.

171
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,040
So this is actually a very important part because as you said, it's a romantic appointment.

172
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,560
So if you have to go to the doctor and he's not your boyfriend or anything like this,

173
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
you don't say I have a date with the doctor.

174
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,060
No, you say I have an appointment with the doctor.

175
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,680
But if it's romantic, you say, oh, I want to get my hair done because I have a date

176
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
tonight.

177
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Right, I have a date.

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,480
I want to look nice for my date.

179
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Okay.

180
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,120
And then he goes on to explain that this date that he has is with a girl that he has been

181
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
chatting with.

182
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,920
Okay, so the verb here is to chat with, chat.

183
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:57,160
Chat just means to talk to, but in internet terms, to chat with means to talk to on the

184
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
internet.

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,120
So maybe you use a program like MSN or Google Gchat to talk to somebody online.

186
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,720
That's called chatting.

187
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
That's right.

188
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,600
So I think everyone has done this at one point or another when you are online chatting via

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,160
MSN messenger or any of these chat clients.

190
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,960
So very, very common thing.

191
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
But remember to add the chat with.

192
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,400
I am chatting with my friends.

193
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,560
Yeah, I don't like to chat with people while I'm at work.

194
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Exactly.

195
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
On the internet.

196
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,040
So now this guy explained about the website match.com and he said that he signed up for

197
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
this website.

198
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,080
Okay, another really key verb when you're talking about internet things.

199
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,200
So for example, if you want to come to EnglishPod, you can sign up for a free trial.

200
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,040
That means provide your information.

201
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,300
All right, start to use.

202
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
That's right.

203
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,080
So it applies for things online and offline.

204
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,000
For example, in the real world or offline, you can sign up for a cooking class.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,560
Or last week, I signed up for a dance class so I can learn how to dance.

207
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Very good.

208
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Okay.

209
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,800
And then to finish off, the guy explained that he's tired of meeting people at bars

210
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
or that his friends set up dates for him.

211
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Okay, so he doesn't like to be set up.

212
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
To be set up, remember that B. To be set up.

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
It means someone else is doing this to you.

214
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,840
So Marco, I want to set you up with my friend.

215
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,640
That means I want to take you and my friend and make you have a date.

216
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,040
Right, exactly.

217
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,760
So this is exactly what it means.

218
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,640
To set someone up or to be set up is to have them go on a date with someone else.

219
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,320
All right, so I don't like to be set up because I like to know the person I will have a date

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,880
with before we go out.

221
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,280
But when you're set up, someone else makes the decision for you.

222
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
That's right.

223
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
It's a little bit difficult.

224
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
That's right.

225
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,560
Okay, so a lot of interesting things here.

226
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:03,440
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue one last time and we'll be right back.

227
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

228
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,320
Oh, I can't.

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,280
I have a date.

230
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Really?

231
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,960
Wow, with who?

232
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,920
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

233
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,920
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

234
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,280
Wait a minute.

235
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
You mean you met her online?

236
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,560
Yeah, I signed up for a website called match.com and it's great.

237
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,200
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any

238
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
pets.

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,680
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

240
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
That's kind of weird.

241
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,280
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

242
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,800
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

243
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,200
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

245
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,360
I guess it does seem logical.

246
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,520
I'll have to check it out.

247
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,880
All right, so talking about setting up, this is another word that comes to mind when your

248
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,120
friends set you up for a date is a blind date.

249
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,840
Okay, so a blind date is not a date with two blind people.

250
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,280
A blind date is a date that you go to when you don't know who the other person is before

251
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
you go.

252
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
That's right.

253
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,880
So my friend's mother loves to set people up on blind dates.

254
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,120
She's a matchmaker.

255
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,800
She makes couples.

256
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,640
And so she will call one person and call the other person and then she'll make them have

257
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
a date.

258
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,400
She sets them up and then they have this date, a blind date.

259
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
A blind date, that's right.

260
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,720
And actually what you're doing with this technology now that you can use a website to find and

261
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,240
meet people who are also looking for romance, it's very interesting.

262
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,920
It's very modern obviously because now we have the technology to do it.

263
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,800
And many people actually have very successful or very great love stories of how they met

264
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,840
online, chatting or while playing a video game online or many different things like

265
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
this.

266
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Well, the thing that I like about it, and I have to say I've never done it, so what

267
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:12,120
I like from hearing about it is that like Match.com, you save a lot of time.

268
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
It seems that way.

269
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
Because you get to tell the person, hey, I don't like people who smoke.

270
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,040
I don't like people who have pets, but I really like people who play video games.

271
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,960
And so you find people who are like that and then you can get to know that person better.

272
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,640
But I think it's hard when you're going on dates, especially your friends, they set you

273
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,120
up and you have nothing in common.

274
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,800
You have no interests that are in common and that can be really frustrating.

275
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,000
So it seems like online dating is a new type of efficient way of dating because you preliminary

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,800
already filter out everyone or everything that you don't like about a person and you

277
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,640
find someone that has your same or similar likes.

278
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,040
But that's modern day, right?

279
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
That's right.

280
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,280
A lot of people I know have dated using these websites and have been very successful.

281
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Really?

282
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
They've been married.

283
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,880
Wow, it's amazing.

284
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
So actually this is a great thing.

285
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Let us know if you have any friend who's found their significant other, husband or wife via

286
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,160
online dating or if you've tried it, maybe you can let us know how it is.

287
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,120
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

288
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,040
Don't forget to sign up if you don't have an account and we'll see you there.

289
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
All right.

290
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Bye guys.

291
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:38,460
