00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,840
My name is Kathryn and we have an unusual lesson for you today.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,760
It's more about writing than about speaking.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
That's right.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,680
Well, many times we have to write emails and if we're working in a sales environment, we

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,680
may need to write an email to a potential client.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,560
Alright, so we're going to learn what is appropriate and what is not in today's lesson.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,520
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:36,640
Melanie, can you help me with something?

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,400
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican embassy and I need some advice on phrasing

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,120
this letter correctly in English.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,000
Sure Tracy, let me just get my laptop.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,760
Right, all set.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,840
Ok, so, to whom it may concern, I am writing…

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
Um, Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,440
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them, so in English,

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,880
you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Ok, more relaxed.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Got it.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,280
Hey Sally, what's up?

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,240
It's Tracy here, just…

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,160
Ok, Tracy, now it's too relaxed.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,320
You've still got to show some respect.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,880
How about starting with Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm…

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,760
Great, ok.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:39,240
Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full-page back

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:48,360
cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Viola Magazine.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,720
That's great.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:02:00,560
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to 45,600 RMB.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,080
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,480
Thanks for…

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,320
Whoa, ok, back up a second Tracy.

34
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,420
That's too direct.

35
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,800
Can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
publication.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You don't want to offend her.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,920
Oops, ok, you're right.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,280
Then I can just end with, all the best, Tracy.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,680
Hmm, maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with, yours sincerely.

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
That's more professional.

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Oh, Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Thank you.

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:47,200
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of that vocab we heard on

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,940
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,040
We have some wonderful adjectives today.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,320
The first one that I wanted to discuss, Marco, is formal.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
Formal, that's right.

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,400
We want to be a little bit more formal when we're writing someone we don't really know

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
too much.

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
That's right.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,960
But be careful because sometimes you can be too formal.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,040
So what exactly does formal mean?

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,720
So if you write a formal email, it's very proper, very respectful.

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,000
So proper in the way that you wouldn't use colloquial terms or phrasal verbs that you

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
would use with your friends.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,440
No, a good example is writing to a lawyer or a judge.

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,840
You want to use formal language.

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Even with a teacher, you might use more formal language.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,720
But with a friend, you don't have to.

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
That's something else.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
That's right.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,600
So when you're writing something that's formal, it's important to be polite as well.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Now what is polite?

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Right.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,960
So you want to be formal, you want to be serious, and you want to be polite.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,680
You want to show respect.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,220
You want to be nice, basically.

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,220
That's right.

71
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,680
And so people can often be described as polite.

72
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,760
He's very polite or she's not polite at all.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,520
And when I was a little kid, my mom used to say, it's very important to be polite.

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,160
You say thank you and you're welcome when you're talking to other people.

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
That's right.

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,120
And that's one way of being polite.

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,520
Now also when we are describing the way that you speak to someone or the way that you write,

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,560
you can be very direct.

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,000
Now being direct means that you say exactly what you want or exactly what you're thinking.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,080
Okay, so maybe if we're talking to this company, you say, hi, I want this.

81
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,360
I will pay this much.

82
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Thank you.

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Bye.

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Right.

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
That's maybe too direct.

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,800
You need to be a little less direct and say nice things in an email.

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
That's right.

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,680
So maybe you want to say to someone that you don't really like the clothes they're wearing,

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
right?

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
You say, hey, do you like my new shirt?

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,040
And if you're very direct, you would say, no, I think it's very ugly.

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
I hate it.

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Right.

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
That's too direct.

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,440
So maybe you would say, I don't really think it suits you very well.

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,200
Or I think a different color would be better on you.

97
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
That's right.

98
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,440
So that's being a little bit less direct.

99
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,600
Now obviously, if you're too direct with someone, you may offend that person.

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Alright, to offend is a verb and to offend someone means to say something that makes

101
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,500
them unhappy or upset or even angry.

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,240
So going back to the same example of the shirt, if you say, I think that shirt is very ugly,

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
that person might be offended.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Gosh.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,240
Or maybe if you say, I think people with brown hair are so ugly and there's someone next

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,880
to me with brown hair, they say, oh, I'm offended.

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Right.

108
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
I'm not ugly, but I have brown hair.

109
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
That's right.

110
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,880
Okay, so you don't want to offend anyone by being too direct or you don't want to have

111
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,360
anyone feel offended.

112
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,440
Now for our last phrase here on Language Takeaway, we have towards the end of the dialogue, Tracy

113
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,200
thanks Melanie by saying, you are a lifesaver.

114
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Thank you.

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
Okay, so don't be confused.

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,280
There is also a candy called lifesavers and she's not calling her a candy.

117
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,640
She's saying, wow, thank you.

118
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,880
You really helped me.

119
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,920
So when someone helps you a lot, you can call them a lifesaver.

120
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,880
Marco, what exactly is the object, the lifesaver?

121
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,520
If you've ever been on a boat, you see this big orange circle that is used to throw into

122
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,480
the water to help someone to prevent them from drowning.

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,080
That is called a lifesaver.

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,920
Okay, so I'm drowning.

125
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,840
I'm having a hard time writing this email.

126
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
I do not know what to say.

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
Marco, you come and help me.

128
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,000
I can say, oh wow, thank you so much.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,320
You're a lifesaver.

130
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,880
That's exactly right.

131
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,520
All right, so we've taken a look at five key words there.

132
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,160
Why don't we take a listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:53,400
Melanie, can you help me with something?

134
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,160
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican embassy and I need some advice on phrasing

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
this letter correctly in English.

136
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,960
Sure Tracy, let me just get my laptop.

137
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,240
Right, all set.

138
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,880
Okay, so to whom it may concern, I am writing...

139
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,240
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them, so in English, you

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,600
can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

142
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,520
Okay, more relaxed.

143
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Got it.

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,080
Hey Sally, what's up?

145
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,960
It's Tracy here, just...

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Okay Tracy, now it's too relaxed.

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,120
You've still got to show some respect.

148
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,600
How about starting with, dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm...

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,840
Great, okay.

150
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:57,040
Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full-page back cover

151
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:05,120
color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Viola Magazine.

152
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,480
That's great.

153
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:17,320
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to 45,600 RMB.

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,880
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

155
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Thanks for...

156
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Whoa, okay, back up a second Tracy.

157
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
That's too direct.

158
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,520
Can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before

159
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,120
publication.

160
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,600
You don't want to offend her.

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Oops, okay, you're right.

162
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,200
Then I can just end with, all the best, Tracy.

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,440
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with, yours sincerely.

164
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
That's more professional.

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,280
Oh, Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

166
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Thank you.

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,640
So today in Fluency Builder we have a number of phrases you can use when you're writing

168
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
an email.

169
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
Some of them are very polite and formal.

170
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,240
Some of them are very informal or casual.

171
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,040
Now this first phrase, Marco, is very, very formal, right?

172
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
That's right.

173
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,040
You start the letter by stating, to whom it may concern.

174
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,160
All right, to whom it may concern.

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,880
Remember that M there.

176
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,440
This is a very formal phrase and we're going to take it as a phrase.

177
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,560
This is how you begin a formal letter.

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
That's right.

179
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,000
Usually you start this letter if it's directed to maybe a company or someone not specific.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
You don't know that person's name and you're just saying, you know, whoever's reading this

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,880
letter, whoever it concerns.

182
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
That's right.

183
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,560
Well, I could say, dear Marco, but in this case, maybe I don't know who the name of the

184
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,880
person I am writing this email to.

185
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
It's a big company.

186
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
There are many people.

187
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,080
So if you don't know who you're writing to in a company or in an organization, you say,

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
to whom it may concern.

189
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
That's right.

190
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Okay.

191
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Now we started very formal.

192
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,080
Melanie said, I think it's a little bit too formal.

193
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Maybe we should be more relaxed.

194
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,340
So Tracy says, okay, got it.

195
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,600
So how about, hey Sally, what's up?

196
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
What's up?

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Okay.

198
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,000
So what's up is the kind of thing I say with my friends, you know, hey Marco, what's up?

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,640
But I would never say this in a formal situation with a boss or with a, you know, an employer

201
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,680
or with a, um, in more serious situation.

202
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Exactly.

203
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Especially if you're writing a, an email to a client, you don't really want to say what's

204
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
up.

205
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
No, never.

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
So remember this is spoken English with your friends, but not something you would write.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,120
Um, so the key here is that you have to show some respect.

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Okay.

209
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
So that's another great phrase, you show some respect.

210
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
All right.

211
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,280
So the key here is that this is, um, the verb is to show, right?

212
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Not to give.

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,080
Um, you want to show respect to someone.

214
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
Well, how do you show respect?

215
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,280
Well, the way that you act, your behaviors.

216
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,120
So if I'm polite and I say, you know, Mr. and Miss and thank you and please, these are

217
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
ways to show respect.

218
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
That's right.

219
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
That's right.

220
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
So that's the way that you are being respectful.

221
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,600
You are showing respect by being very polite.

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,480
For example, in Japan, it is common to take your shoes off when you go to a friend's home,

223
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
their house in order to show respect to them.

224
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
That's right.

225
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Very good.

226
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,520
Now, as we continue writing the letter towards the end, we wanted to play it safe and just

227
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,640
write your sincerely to close the letter off.

228
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
All right.

229
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
So this phrase, play it safe.

230
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,520
What does this mean?

231
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,200
When we're talking about making a decision or taking a risk, we want to play it safe.

232
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,160
We want to use the less risky option.

233
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
All right.

234
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,760
So the key here is that the verb is to play.

235
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,840
Play it safe.

236
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,000
This means that, yeah, there's maybe a risky option and a safe option and it's better to

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
take the safe option.

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Play it safe.

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's right.

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,720
So that's the way that you would use this phrase to play it safe, to make a decision

242
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,500
that doesn't have too much risk or that you know that will work very well.

243
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,440
And to close things off, another option to end the letter, we could say, all the best.

244
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,920
All the best, Tracy.

245
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
All the best, Tracy.

246
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
All right.

247
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,800
So this is a way to end a letter.

248
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,000
You can say sincerely or best, but it's a very nice way to end if you just say all the

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
best and then you say, you know, after that you have a comma and then you sign your name.

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's right.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All right.

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,200
Melanie, can you help me with something?

254
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,940
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican embassy and I need some advice on phrasing

255
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,000
this letter correctly in English.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,320
Sure, Tracy.

257
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,000
Let me just get my laptop.

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,840
Right.

259
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
All set.

260
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,600
Okay, so to whom it may concern, I am writing...

261
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,320
Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

262
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,880
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them.

263
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,400
So in English, you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

264
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,280
Okay, more relaxed.

265
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Got it.

266
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
Hey, Sally, what's up?

267
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,320
It's Tracy here.

268
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Just...

269
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay, Tracy.

270
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,720
Now it's too relaxed.

271
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,880
You've still got to show some respect.

272
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,400
How about starting with Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm...

273
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Great.

274
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Okay.

275
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:42,840
Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover

276
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:50,920
color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Viola Magazine.

277
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,280
That's great.

278
00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:03,120
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to 45,600 RMB.

279
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:11,000
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Thanks for...

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Whoa.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,360
Okay, back up a second, Tracy.

283
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,980
That's too direct.

284
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,360
Can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before

285
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
publication.

286
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
You don't want to offend her.

287
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Oops.

288
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Okay, you're right.

289
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,840
Then I can just end with, all the best, Tracy.

290
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with, yours sincerely.

291
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
That's more professional.

292
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,080
Oh, Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

293
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,440
Thank you.

294
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,120
So talking about ending formal emails or emails that you're writing to clients, colleagues,

295
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,560
we can say sincerely, and your name, sincerely, Marco.

296
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
You can say, all the best, best regards.

297
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,400
Now I've noticed that some people who aren't native English speakers, sometimes they will

298
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,760
close a letter, maybe even a formal letter, saying, yours truly, Marco, for example.

299
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,960
Is that really appropriate for a business setting or a client?

300
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,920
I would not use yours truly.

301
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,640
Maybe if you're trying to build a relationship with your client and you're very honest, but

302
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,800
it seems to me to be very personal.

303
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Very romantic.

304
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,900
Yes, yours truly.

305
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,040
So I would say in that case, use sincerely or kind regards, or regards, which are a little

306
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,920
bit more professional and less emotional.

307
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,640
If you want to have a romantic letter, you can say, all my love or love or yours truly

308
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,120
or yours faithfully.

309
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,680
This is a very important topic, I think, because many times in school we do learn how to write

310
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,520
letters, but usually they are more personal letters.

311
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,840
And so we memorize that usually at the end of the email or the end of the letter, you

312
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,560
say yours, Marco, or yours truly, Marco.

313
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,040
And although it is correct, it's not really appropriate for a professional setting.

314
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
That's right.

315
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,280
Just a reminder, if you're signing off your email or your letter and you're at an office,

316
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,880
you're in your company, you want to say best or best regards or some of the things that

317
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,240
we talked about here today.

318
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Very good.

319
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
All right.

320
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,400
So if you have any questions or any other doubts, you can always find us at EnglishPod.com

321
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
and we'll see you guys there.

322
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Bye.

323
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:45,760
Bye-bye.
