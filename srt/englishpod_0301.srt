00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,500
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a very popular kind of movie.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right. Today we're talking about Twilight and all the creatures that you can find in this new movie.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,500
Okay, so the name of the movie is Twilight. Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You want to go to the movies tonight? Sure. What's playing? The new Twilight movie.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way am I watching that.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn't make sense.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they're so different.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy and there you have it.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Plus the cast is hip. Young people that make the movie even more enticing.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't buy into that. I think it's just a fad.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, we're back. So now let's just jump into some vocab.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's take a look at what we've chosen for you on Language Takeaway.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, so on Language Takeaway today, Marco, we have three different kinds of creature or monster.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right. So if anyone knows about the movie Twilight, it's mostly about vampires.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's right. So vampires are a kind of immortal creature.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So vampires are a kind of imaginary creature that like to suck people's blood.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They have long teeth.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right. So they look like people and they go out at night and they drink people's blood.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And they can't stand in the sunlight because they will die if they're in the sunlight.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right. Alright, so we have vampires.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And also another type of imaginary creature that we find here is werewolves.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We can find werewolves.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So we have the word wolf. A wolf is an animal.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But a werewolf is a man or a woman who turns into an animal when the moon is full.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Right. So you are a man or a woman by day.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But then at night when there is a full moon, you transform into a wolf.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you are a werewolf.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And we have one other kind of monster here.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is a very disgusting kind of monster called a zombie.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Alright. Also very popular in the movies, you have zombies.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So they are people who are dead but they are still alive.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right. So they can't think. All they want to do is eat other people.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And they are usually very, very stupid and you have to cut their heads off to kill them.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right. So zombies are also a very popular type of creature in these movies.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So we have three creatures. Vampires, werewolves and zombies.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But now let's move on to some of the other vocab that we found.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When the friend was explaining about the movie and how it's very cool, she said that the cast is hip.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ok. So something that is hip is also very cool.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So a hip person is someone who is really interesting or cool or maybe up to date, current.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Right. Very popular.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So for example, you can also talk about a place, a restaurant or a club as being very hip.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right. So you can say, these days, bell-bottom pants are not hip anymore.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They were hip in the 1970s.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's right. So they are not cool, they are not popular, they are not up to date.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now moving on to the end of that paragraph, we see that the explanation continued in saying that

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the movie makes it even more enticing having a hip cast and a sexy theme.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So something that is enticing makes you want it. Ok.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So an enticing movie attracts people.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So I find warm apple pie very enticing. It makes me want to eat it.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ok. So something that is enticing basically makes you want to have it or it makes you desire it.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Exactly.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright. And our last word for language takeaway when the friend was kind of skeptical and said,

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you know what, I think it's just a fad.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ok. Something is a fad if it is a passing trend.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So it's not always popular. It's only popular for a short time.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So the word is fad, F-A-D. It sounds very similar to fat but it's not. It's a fad.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Fad. So we can say that Twilight is a fad. It's something that's popular now but that might not be popular in two years.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Exactly. So it's something that's very popular now but maybe later it won't be like maybe for example Harry Potter was a fad.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Exactly. So that's language takeaway for today but don't go anywhere.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We still have some great phrases for you coming up in Fluency Builder.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You want to go to the movies tonight?

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sure. What's playing?

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The new Twilight movie.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way am I watching that.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn't make sense.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You have a couple that is in love but can't get married.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they are so different.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy and there you have it.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Plus the cast is hip. Young people that make the movie even more enticing.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't buy into that. I think it's just a fad.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright we're back. So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Fluency Builder.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The first phrase that we have today is related to this idea of going to the movies.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And so one of the characters today said, sure I want to go to the movies. What's playing?

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's right. Now this question is a key question and you can use this whenever you want to know what movie is playing.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What movie is currently being shown at the theater or at the cinema.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay so what movie is playing. There are many movies playing or there are no good movies playing tonight.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So a movie plays at a theater.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Exactly. So you want to know what movie is playing? You say, what movie is playing tonight?

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright. So now for our next phrase. This is actually going back to the qualities of vampires.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
A couple in the dialogue described vampires as having superhuman strength.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay so in this case super means more than. So superhuman strength is more than what's normal for a human being.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So maybe a human can pick up a table. But superhuman strength means that if I have it, maybe I can pick up a car.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's right.

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Or something that's very unusual. They're very heavy.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right. So superhuman strength. We're talking about how strong you are. And then you can also mix it up with other qualities of a person.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So for example you can have superhuman speed. You're very very fast.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Superman is someone who had both superhuman strength and superhuman speed.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right. So it's a way to describe a person having a quality that's more than normal.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And for our next phrase, after superhuman strength and something that's really sexy, that person says, and there you have it.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And there you have it.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So why do you end that sentence with, and there you have it?

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And there you have it means, and that's the explanation why.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So let's think of the question. The question is, why do people like these vampire movies?

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the other person said, well vampires are sexy and they're immortal and they have superhuman strength.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And there you have it. So that means, and that's why.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay. So it's usually this phrase, and there you have it, you have to explain something or give a couple of ideas before you use it.

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
All right. And exactly. And the key here is that, and there you have it, comes at the end of that statement.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Always.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, you know, why is Jim popular?

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You could say, well, he's funny, he's smart, he's good looking, and there you have it.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right. Perfect. So you're basically saying, and that's the reason why.

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All right. And for our last phrase, when we were talking about a fad, the person said, pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So this might seem a little bit confusing. What does it mean by everyone will be into werewolves and zombies?

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay. So let's take a look at this as a phrase. To be into. I am into something. You are into something.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This means I am interested in. Okay. So I could say, I am into books and movies. Marco, what are you into?

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So if I say, I am into surfing and bungee jumping.

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I would say, it sounds like you're interested in, or it sounds like you like sports, extreme sports.

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So you can be not only into activities, but you can be into a specific type of movies. For example, I'm really into horror movies.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I could say, I'm not into horror movies. I am into romantic comedies.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay. So it's another way of saying that you enjoy it or you like it, or you realize some type of activity.

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Exactly. All right. That's it for Fluency Builder. Let's take another listen to today's dialogue and we'll be right back.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You want to go to the movies tonight? Sure. What's playing? The new Twilight movie.

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way am I watching that.

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn't make sense.

124
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You have a couple that is in love, but can't be together because they're so different.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy, and there you have it.

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Plus, the cast is hip. Young people that make the movie even more enticing.

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't buy into that. I think it's just a fad. Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

128
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:12,000
All right, we're back. So obviously the dialogue revolves around Twilight and vampires, but mostly it's all about, as we said, something that's hip, that's current, that's popular now, but many times is also a fad.

129
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right. So let's think. What was a fad from the 1980s?

130
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think the 80s, the fad was, maybe you can talk about the hairstyles. Men and women had those big kind of hairstyles. Long in the back and very tall in the front.

131
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's right. So in the 80s, as far as fashion fads, things that were only popular for a short time, we had big hair and we had bright colors like electric pink and green and blue, and also those t-shirts that would change color when it was hot or cold.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Those were really cool. Those should come back.

133
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Those were super hip. Well, now it's hip to wear 80s clothes. So it's another fad.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right, exactly. Because then that's called that you're being, you like, what is it?

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Retro.

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Retro, yeah.

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, retro means you like to use styles from a long time ago. So yeah, 70s style, 80s style.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And well, in the movies now, the fad before was magic and sorcerers. You had Harry Potter. Now it's turned to vampires.

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's right. I wonder what the fad will be in a couple of years. I don't think, I don't agree with the person in today's dialogue. I don't think zombies will be a fad.

140
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There was a short period a couple of years ago when there were many, many zombie movies.

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah.

142
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
For example, Resident Evil or Shaun of the Dead.

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But I wonder in the future if we're going to be seeing movies about other things.

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, I imagine maybe not in these creatures. I don't know. I guess vampires have always been kind of sexy because as you know, they're immortal and...

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They're good looking.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
They're usually very good looking and charming and that's how they get their victims.

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's right.
