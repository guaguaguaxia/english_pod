00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
And my name is Erika.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,760
Today we're bringing you another one of our sports lessons and this time we're going to

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,520
go to a boxing match.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
That's right.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,840
So we're going to be learning a language that you can use if you're talking about boxing,

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,280
but not only boxing, right?

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
Right.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,320
We can also use this language for describing a fight or somebody that's fighting.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Okay, so not that we're asking our listeners to get into fights, but if ever you see a

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,320
fight, at least now you'll have the language to talk about it.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Exactly.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
So let's listen to a dialogue for the first time.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,000
It might sound familiar.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,880
We have the legendary Rocky Balboa at EnglishPod fighting for the heavyweight championship.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,260
So let's see what happens.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,480
Welcome back, boxing fans.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,600
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man with the iron jaw, Bob Copeland.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Thank you, Rick.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,860
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,260
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel and Casino where the World Heavyweight Championship

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,420
is about to get underway.

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,880
That's right, Bob.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,460
We're about to witness the legendary Italian stallion himself, Rocky Balboa, square off

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,980
against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,720
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,300
Both fighters are in the ring and we are about to begin.

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:37,900
In the blue corner, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world,

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:46,740
the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:56,300
In the red corner, weighing 218 pounds and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts,

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,060
the undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian stallion, Rocky

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,940
Balboa.

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,820
There's the bell and this fight is underway.

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,700
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

36
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,940
He dodges successfully and counterattacks with a strong right hook.

37
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,460
Apollo is cut.

38
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,180
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,800
This is his chance.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,740
Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left.

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,060
Apollo is getting pounded.

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,740
Apollo recovers with a powerful haymaker and catches Rocky off guard.

43
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
He's down.

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,740
The ref starts the count.

45
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:55,740
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,900
Wow sounds like a great fight.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,020
Amazing fight and I don't know who's going to win.

48
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,260
Rocky apparently got knocked down.

49
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,260
What do you think will happen?

50
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,860
Well, if I know anything about Rocky Balboa, he will not stay knocked down for long.

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,860
All right.

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,820
Let's take a look at some of the language we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,300
Language Takeaway.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,940
Well, Rickfield said that we have a very gruesome match tonight.

55
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,740
A gruesome match.

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Gruesome.

57
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
All right.

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,660
So, if something is gruesome.

59
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,100
It's really, it's bad, it's terrible, it's bloody.

60
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Okay.

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,900
Bloody, terrible, very hard or like a gruesome fight would be a very bloody fight.

62
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,940
Yeah, or a gruesome film.

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Okay.

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
Very good.

65
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
So, gruesome.

66
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,260
Now, they mentioned that both fighters are in the ring.

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,380
Both fighters are in the ring.

68
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
The ring.

69
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Okay.

70
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,340
So, the ring is the physical space where they fight.

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
But isn't it square?

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,820
Yeah, it is square.

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,700
It is not really circular, but it's called a boxing ring.

74
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm not really sure why.

75
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,660
Well, maybe one of our listeners knows and can tell us about that because I am not an

76
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,200
expert on boxing.

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,060
But what I do know is our next word.

78
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,860
They were describing Rocky Balboa's career and they said he had 37 knockouts.

79
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
Okay.

80
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
A knockout.

81
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,420
A knockout.

82
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,860
In this sense, knockout is a noun.

83
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,900
A knockout is when the fighter hits the other fighter and he falls to the ground and he

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,620
can't get up in 10 seconds because he's tired, he's dizzy, he's hurt.

85
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,620
Okay.

86
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,620
So, that's a knockout.

87
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Okay.

88
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,100
So, it's a technical boxing word.

89
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,380
It's the action of falling to the ground and not getting up.

90
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Right.

91
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,580
But there's also a verb, to knock out.

92
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,380
Or to knock someone out.

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Exactly.

94
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,180
So, when you say, I knocked this guy out.

95
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,460
It means I hit him so hard that he fell to the floor and maybe he was unconscious for

96
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
a while.

97
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,460
So, he fell asleep basically.

98
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,460
Almost.

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,460
Yeah.

100
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,460
So, it's very similar.

101
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,460
The noun form to the verb form.

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,300
So, basically, if you knock someone out, you get a knockout.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Okay.

104
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,260
So, to knock someone out, a knockout.

105
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Alright.

106
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,900
Now, for our next word, we saw as Apollo quickly began to jab Rocky Balboa.

107
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,060
So, the noun, a jab.

108
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,820
So, a jab.

109
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Quick jabs.

110
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,500
So, a jab is a kind of punch, right?

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,060
It's a fast, short, but not very strong punch.

112
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Okay.

113
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,460
So, a technical boxing word, a jab.

114
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
A jab.

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,820
So, it can also be a verb, right?

116
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Right.

117
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
So, to jab.

118
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
To jab.

119
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,940
Now, Apollo was throwing jabs and Rocky began to dodge.

120
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Alright.

121
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,100
And that's our next word, to dodge.

122
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Dodge.

123
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
D-O-D-G-E.

124
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
To dodge.

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Alright.

126
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,860
So, if you dodge, you're trying to avoid getting hit.

127
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
Right.

128
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,060
So, you move your body so that you're not hit.

129
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
Exactly.

130
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,180
Now, we can also use it in different ways.

131
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,420
Not only do you dodge when somebody's trying to punch you.

132
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,380
You can also, for example, dodge a bullet.

133
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Right.

134
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,020
So, when you dodge a bullet, you avoid some bad situation or some bad event.

135
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Right.

136
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,060
So, we have many examples of dodge used in other contexts.

137
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,020
So, why don't we listen to some examples?

138
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Example one.

139
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,620
See that guy dodging through the traffic?

140
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,060
He's going to get hit by a car if he's not careful.

141
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Example two.

142
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,140
Well, the storm turned south.

143
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,740
So, it looks like we managed to dodge a bullet.

144
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Example three.

145
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,620
Look, you're the one who is in charge of sales and the numbers are down.

146
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,140
It's your problem, so stop trying to dodge your responsibilities.

147
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,660
You know, that word reminds me of another sport, dodgeball.

148
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
Oh, dodgeball.

149
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Exactly.

150
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Same principle.

151
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,380
Yeah, but that's an entirely different lesson.

152
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,340
I think we need to focus here on the boxing vocabulary.

153
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,740
So, the announcers said that Apollo is getting pounded.

154
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,380
To get pounded.

155
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
To get pounded.

156
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,340
Now, if someone is getting pounded.

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,580
They're getting hit really hard.

158
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,580
And a lot.

159
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,500
So, to get pounded.

161
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,820
Get pounded.

162
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,140
And now, we have one more word and it's also another boxing term called a haymaker.

163
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,540
A powerful haymaker.

164
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
Okay.

165
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,140
So, Apollo received a powerful haymaker.

166
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,380
Now, this word is actually new to me.

167
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,660
So, Marco, what does it mean?

168
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,420
Basically, it's a very strong, very wild punch.

169
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
Okay.

170
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,660
So, you don't have really good form.

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,780
Your body is kind of moving all over the place.

172
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Right.

173
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
So, you don't have much balance.

174
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,540
So, you just throw your entire body and your fist at someone to hit them as hard as you

175
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
can.

176
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,540
That's a haymaker.

177
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
All right.

178
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,060
A technical boxing word here for you guys.

179
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,620
But now, we've got some interesting phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

180
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Fluency Builder.

181
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
All right.

182
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,860
So, on Fluency Builder today, we're going to take a look at some of these phrases and

183
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,540
we have four of them for you today.

184
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,100
So, let's get started with the first one.

185
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,700
Well, the announcer said that the boxing match was about to get underway.

186
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,780
Okay.

187
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
To get underway.

188
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
To get underway.

189
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,100
So, again, this is another way of saying about to begin.

190
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Right.

191
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
All right.

192
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,860
So, we're about to get underway with this new project.

193
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,620
Or the meeting's just about to get underway.

194
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,500
So, make sure everyone's here.

195
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Very good.

196
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,700
So, the match was about to get underway and the sports announcer said that Rocky Balboa

197
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,460
is going to square off against his lifetime rival.

198
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,860
So, we're going to look at this phrase, to square off against someone.

199
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
All right.

200
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,380
I'm going to square off against Jim.

201
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,700
All right.

202
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,380
When you square off against Jim, you get ready to fight with him or to compete with him,

203
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,380
right?

204
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
Right.

205
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,260
So, we're about to have a one-to-one competition.

206
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,460
So, this is like a sports word, but it's also really commonly used in a lot of different

207
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
contexts.

208
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,900
So, why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use this phrase to square off.

209
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Example one.

210
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,980
The two countries are moving their armies close to the borders as they prepare to square

211
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,900
off in a border dispute.

212
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Example two.

213
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,480
Italy and Brazil are squaring off in the final game this afternoon.

214
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,340
Example three.

215
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,900
Lisa and Daniel squared off against each other in the marketing meeting today.

216
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,780
They were both pretty angry.

217
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,180
All right.

218
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,860
So, great examples, and I think we can use it now not only in boxing, but in other situations.

219
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,880
Now, Bob said that Rocky landed a strong blow.

220
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,620
To land a strong blow.

221
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
All right.

222
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,140
So, land a strong blow.

223
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,940
Now, let's break this down.

224
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,140
So, a blow.

225
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,980
A blow is a punch or a hit.

226
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Okay.

227
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,060
And when you land a strong blow, what happens?

228
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,620
You basically successfully hit your opponent with a punch or hit.

229
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,100
So, you hit them, so your fist meets their body.

230
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Yes.

231
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,020
So, your fist landed on their body.

232
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
Mm-hmm.

233
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,180
So, I could also change this a little bit.

234
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,900
I could say, I landed a punch.

235
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Right.

236
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,380
Or in boxing terms, he landed a strong left jab.

237
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,380
Okay.

238
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,380
So, to land a blow.

239
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,140
The announcer described it as Rock threw a left.

240
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
To throw a left.

241
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,500
So, he said he threw a left and a right.

242
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Now again, we'll take this one apart.

243
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,020
So, a left.

244
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
What are we talking about?

245
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,620
Basically, a left punch, but we can omit punch.

246
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay.

247
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,700
So, it's a punch with your left hand, but the verb throw, you throw a left punch.

248
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,460
So, basically, you punch somebody with your left.

249
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Okay.

250
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,500
So, it's just another way of saying to punch someone.

251
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
To punch someone.

252
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Right.

253
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,940
So, Bob started to throw some punches at the other guy.

254
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,940
All right.

255
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Look over there.

256
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
That guy's throwing punches.

257
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
All right.

258
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,580
So, to throw a left.

259
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
To throw a punch.

260
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,980
Now, again, you can use this in a lot of different ways with a lot of different types of punches.

261
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
So, you could say to throw a jab.

262
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Okay.

263
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,980
Or throw an uppercut.

264
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
Or throw a hook.

265
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Okay.

266
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,380
So, now that we've seen all these phrases, why don't we listen to the dialogue for the

267
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:13,900
very last time and we'll come back in a little bit.

268
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,260
Welcome back, boxing fans.

269
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,220
My name is Rick Fields, and here with me is the man with the iron jaw, Bob Copeland.

270
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,260
Thank you, Rick.

271
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,620
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

272
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,020
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, where the World Heavyweight Championship

273
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,180
is about to get underway.

274
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,660
That's right, Bob.

275
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,220
We're about to witness the legendary Italian Stallion himself, Rocky Balboa, square off

276
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,740
against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

277
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,500
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

278
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,060
Both fighters are in the ring, and we are about to begin.

279
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:59,660
In the blue corner, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world,

280
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:08,540
the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

281
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:18,100
In the red corner, weighing 218 pounds, and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts,

282
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,900
the undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian Stallion, Rocky

283
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:31,780
Balboa.

284
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,660
There's the bell, and this fight is underway.

285
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,300
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

286
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,740
Rocky dodges successfully and counterattacks with a strong right hook.

287
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,260
Apollo is cut.

288
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,980
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

289
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,620
This is his chance.

290
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,540
Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left.

291
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,860
Apollo is getting pounded.

292
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,540
Apollo recovers with a powerful haymaker and catches Rocky off guard.

293
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
He's down.

294
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,540
The ref starts the count.

295
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:19,100
One, two, three, four, five.

296
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,420
So as I mentioned, Marco, I'm not really that much of a fan or that knowledgeable about

297
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
boxing.

298
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,940
And actually, this is becoming a theme in these sports lessons, isn't it?

299
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,380
Well, boxing is a very popular sport in North America.

300
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,860
I'm not really that big of a fan, but I have seen a couple of matches.

301
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:47,140
And it's very interesting because as we saw in our dialogue, most big fights take place

302
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,540
in Las Vegas at some big hotel.

303
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Right.

304
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,340
But you said it's super popular and everyone wants to watch these matches.

305
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,540
And obviously, everyone can't go to Las Vegas.

306
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,980
So what's the common way for most people to watch these boxing matches?

307
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Right.

308
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,140
So in the United States, there's something very popular called pay-per-view.

309
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,820
And I'm sure in your countries, you have something similar.

310
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,760
Basically, pay-per-view, you can buy the fight so you can have access to it and watch it

311
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
on your TV.

312
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,940
But you only pay one time to watch like maybe two hours, right?

313
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Right.

314
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,260
So let's say you're at your house, it's six o'clock and the fight begins at eight.

315
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:30,980
So you can call your TV cable company or maybe use on the internet with a credit card and

316
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,400
they activate it on your TV so you can watch the fight.

317
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,580
And when it's over, well, you finished watching it.

318
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,260
Now, it's pretty expensive, isn't it?

319
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,260
Yeah.

320
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,060
Pay-per-view can be very expensive depending on what event it is because sometimes it's

321
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,020
boxing matches, concerts or special events.

322
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,820
So it can maybe cost, I don't know, 60, 80, maybe $100.

323
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,380
So it's very popular for one house to buy the pay-per-view and then many friends come

324
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,100
over and everyone chips in with five or $10 and everyone watches it on one TV.

325
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
All right.

326
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,820
So the pay-per-view boxing party, a common way to watch the sport in America.

327
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Exactly.

328
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,740
Now, why don't you guys visit our website and tell us about boxing.

329
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Do you guys like it?

330
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,140
Do you know anything about it?

331
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,980
Are you guys maybe even boxers yourselves?

332
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Or former boxers.

333
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
All right.

334
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,620
So we'll see you guys at our website and also if you have any questions or comments, be

335
