00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,740
My name is Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,900
This is about fixing things.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
That's right.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,600
So sometimes in our office or in our house, some small things may break like maybe the

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,300
door or the air conditioning.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,800
So in this case, we need to call a special guy to come and fix it.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,380
So let's listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about who this

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:35,340
guy is.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,120
The air conditioning is not working.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,240
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,540
Dan is on top of that.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,600
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
up.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
That would be convenient.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
It's really annoying.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,860
Yeah, you're right.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,540
This office is falling apart.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,960
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
lot was flooded.

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
I know.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,040
I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,320
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,080
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,800
So now let's take a look at some of those key words and phrases on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,680
Language Takeaway Our first word today is the name of this

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
job.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,480
The person is called a handyman.

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,720
Okay, so that's a profession.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,360
You are a handyman.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
Now what exactly does a handyman do?

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,560
Well, a handyman fixes things.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,400
He is usually a generalist.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,900
He fixes things all over the house, not just the bathroom or the kitchen.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,680
So he can just fix things that are a little bit broken.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,800
But if, for example, your car needs a new radiator or it needs a new important part,

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,000
maybe you would take the car to someone who is more experienced with cars.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,400
But in the case of a handyman, if anything is broken, he can generally fix it.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,840
Okay, so as Catherine explained, basically a handyman just does any type or many types

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
of general work of things that may be broken around the house or the office.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,800
We had a couple of examples of these in today's dialogue, didn't we?

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
What was that first one?

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Kind of gross.

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,960
Yeah, well, he had to fix the air conditioning, but then he also had to fix the bathroom toilet

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,000
because it kept clogging up.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, so a toilet gets clogged up.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,760
To clog up.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,840
What does this mean?

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,760
So it means that something is blocking the way of the water being able to go out.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,040
So the water doesn't go down.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,920
And sometimes if the toilet is really clogged and someone tries to flush the toilet again,

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,400
the water comes onto the floor and it's very dirty and very gross.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
That's right.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,160
So actually, maybe sometimes in the kitchen, pieces of food may fall into the sink and

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,280
it may clog up the sink.

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,160
Okay, so to clog up means to block or to get in the way of.

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,380
That's right.

61
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,120
And apart from the toilets being clogged up, he also may have to take a look at the circuit

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
breakers.

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
All right, so this is not about water or about plumbing.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Circuit breakers have to do with electricity.

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,240
And in this case, that box in your apartment or near your apartment that controls the different

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,360
circuits.

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,160
So sometimes if the lights go out, you know that you have to check the circuit breaker

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,520
and make sure that the circuits are all working properly.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
That's right.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,520
So the circuit breakers are kind of like a protection from too much electricity and that's

71
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,200
why they go out.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,040
And now for our final word on language takeaway, something that also got clogged up at their

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
office, we're talking about the gutters.

74
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,680
All right, so many people's houses have gutters or sometimes an office building will have

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
gutters.

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,400
These are trays on the roof of a house or a building that will catch the water when

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
it rains.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,480
Because you know, sometimes rainwater can be very, very heavy and it's dangerous on

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,360
your house, on the roof of your house because it can hurt the roof.

80
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,240
But if it comes into this gutter, into this little tray, then it will come down and fall

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
on the ground.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,640
So these are a way to protect your roof.

83
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,860
But these often get clogged up with leaves and with garbage.

84
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,860
That's right.

85
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,240
So they're like small little ways or little roads, if you want to call them, where the

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,440
water can go and escape and go into a specific place.

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,580
We have them on the sides of roads as well, many times.

88
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,320
So gutters that you find on the ground, sometimes you find them on the roof of a house, but

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,600
those are a little bit different.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,960
The gutters on the ground are basically pathways for water to come down.

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,520
Because if there's no gutter, then all of the water is on the road and it can flood

92
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
very quickly.

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
That's right.

94
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,720
And so this is a way for the water and even the garbage to go on the side of the road

95
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,400
and not be in the way of the cars.

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
That's right.

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
You see them on highways and roads very often because you don't want the road filled with

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
water.

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,920
So these gutters are a small path where all the water will fall into it and escape safely

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
from the highway.

101
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
That's right.

102
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
All right.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,600
So that's all the time we have for Language Takeaway.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,980
Why don't we go back, have another listen to the dialogue and we'll be back soon with

105
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:40,880
Fluency Builder.

106
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
The air conditioning is not working.

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,800
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,080
Dan is on top of that.

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,200
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging

110
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
up.

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
That would be convenient.

112
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,160
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,400
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
It's really annoying.

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,420
Yeah, you're right.

116
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,960
This office is falling apart.

117
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
lot was flooded.

119
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
I know.

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,600
I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day.

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,800
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

122
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,680
Now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Fluency Builder.

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Well, this first phrase is a phrase that I like to use and I do use it very often.

125
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,080
We heard that Dan is on top of that.

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,240
We need to call a handyman in here and he says, nope, Dan is on top of that.

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,240
To be on top of something, what does it mean?

128
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,080
When she says Dan is on top of that, she's basically saying Dan is taking care of this

129
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240
or Dan is already calling the handyman to come and fix it.

130
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,160
You are aware of the problem and you're trying to solve it.

131
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Okay, so don't worry.

132
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
You don't have to call the handyman.

133
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,400
Dan is on top of that.

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Dan will call him.

135
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Right.

136
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,320
So to be on top of something is to make sure that something is done.

137
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,840
So you could say, you know, Marco, I really, I hope you stay on top of that project because

138
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
it's very important.

139
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Right.

140
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,280
Or don't worry, the report will be finished on time.

141
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,520
I am on top of that.

142
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Great.

143
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
All right.

144
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,360
Now moving on to our next phrase, they were talking about all the problems that this office

145
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,600
has and the person said, well, they might as well ask the handyman to also fix the electrical

146
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
wiring.

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Okay.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,520
So this phrase might as well is, it's kind of hard to understand I think sometimes.

149
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,760
Basically what the speaker is saying is that while he is doing this, he can also do something

150
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
else.

151
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Okay.

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
So he's here.

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
He can fix many things.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,960
He might as well also fix electrical wiring.

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Right.

156
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,040
So taking advantage of the fact that you are already doing something or you are already

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,200
here, you can start doing something else as well.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,160
Or maybe we could say this in a different context to like, you know, we're going to

159
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,800
order a pizza for lunch.

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,920
You know what, Marco might as well order two because there are so many people here.

161
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Right.

162
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,960
So taking advantage of the fact that we are ordering pizza, we might as well get more

163
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
for everyone.

164
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Okay.

165
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,360
And for our last phrase, when they mentioned all the work that has to be done, they said

166
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,360
the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

167
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Okay.

168
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,280
So if someone has his work cut out for him, it means that he has a lot of work to do.

169
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
That's right.

170
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,560
You can also say this to someone that you're talking to.

171
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
So Marco, Marco is writing a book.

172
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,040
I say, Hey Marco, that's a really long book you're writing.

173
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,360
It looks like you really have your work cut out for you.

174
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,800
That's right.

175
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,640
Or maybe this project is really difficult.

176
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
I really have my work cut out.

177
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Okay.

178
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,600
So you're basically saying I have a very hard time ahead of me.

179
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Okay.

180
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,880
So that's all the phrases we have for you.

181
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:07,240
Why don't we have a listen to our dialogue one last time.

182
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,040
The air conditioning is not working.

183
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,160
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

184
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
Dan is on top of that.

185
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,480
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging

186
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
up.

187
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
That's really inconvenient.

188
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,480
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,720
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

190
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
It's really annoying.

191
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,760
Yeah, you're right.

192
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,280
This office is falling apart.

193
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,840
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking

194
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,200
lot was flooded.

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
I know.

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day.

197
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,240
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

198
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,640
So a handyman is also commonly referred to as a jack of all trades.

199
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
That's right.

200
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,280
So these are both kind of funny words.

201
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,600
First of all, handy as an adjective means useful or helpful.

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,340
So maybe a hammer is a handy tool.

203
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,880
It's a very handy tool or I find my iPhone has some very handy applications.

204
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,240
I can use the dictionary.

205
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,960
So a handyman is someone who's helpful.

206
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
He can do many things.

207
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,520
But a jack of all trades is very special because it means he is a person that can do basically

208
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,720
any job.

209
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Right.

210
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,480
So sometimes in offices, people may have someone that they may refer to as a jack of all trades.

211
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
So he may fix the computers.

212
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,880
He also knows a little bit about marketing and does many odd and random things around

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
the office.

214
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
That's right.

215
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,480
You could say my friend Paul, he's a jack of all trades.

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,980
He can fix a car.

217
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,440
He can cook.

218
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,560
He can fix a door or a window, but he can also sew.

219
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
So he's a jack of all trades.

220
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
He has many, many skills.

221
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
That's right.

222
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,000
And talking about these skills, being a handyman is not a profession per se.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,680
It's actually a trade.

224
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
That's right.

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,160
And so we say this because it's something that you normally do with your hands and you

226
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,440
don't have to go to university to study it.

227
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,640
You maybe have an apprenticeship where you study by working.

228
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,280
And it's one of a few very, very important trades like being a plumber or an electrician.

229
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,000
But a handyman is more general.

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
Like we said, you can do many different things.

231
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
That's right.

232
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
So very interesting.

233
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,320
There are many trades out there.

234
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,840
Maybe you can come on the site and mention some of these that you may know.

235
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,520
Like for example, a very well known trade is a cobbler, a person that makes shoes.

236
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Makes shoes or fixes shoes.

237
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,160
It's a very weird word though because shoes and cobbler don't seem to have much to do

238
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
with each other.

239
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Yeah.

240
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,320
Well, many, many, many trades like this.

241
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,000
I know before they used to be blacksmiths.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
So many types of trades.

243
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,260
