00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Katarina- And my name is Katarina.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,240
So today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for our learners and we're talking

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,240
about what?

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Marco- Healthcare.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,560
Katarina- Okay, this is a very important topic because it's been in the news recently, especially

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,840
in the context of American politics.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,200
And so I don't know if you've heard things about this listeners, but the healthcare is

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
a very hot topic.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Marco- Exactly.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,760
So basically what we're talking about is health insurance, whether it's private health insurance

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,240
or you know, like a standard national insurance program.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Katarina- Exactly.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,320
And so your country might have a private option where you can pay a private company for insurance

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,200
or public option like England or Australia, where your country will actually provide healthcare

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,440
for you at no extra cost.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,520
Marco- Very good.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
So it's an interesting topic.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,760
Why don't we jump directly into the dialogue and we'll be back to explain a couple of things.

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,640
Katarina- Hey, honey, how was your day?

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Marco- It was all right.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,640
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
He's in a bit of a jam.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Katarina- Why?

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
What happened?

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,520
Marco- Well, his son had an accident.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,400
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,280
This really got me thinking and I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
HMOs.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,760
Katarina- Yeah, you're right.

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,280
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
Marco- Exactly.

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,360
I searched on the web and found a couple of HMOs with low copays and good coverage.

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,840
The deductibles are low too.

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Katarina- Sounds good.

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
Marco- Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,760
Katarina- I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,800
Marco- Not in a million years.

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,400
All right, we're back.

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,360
So a lot of interesting vocab here.

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,320
Why don't we take a look at it real fast in Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,120
Katarina- Okay, Marco, this first phrase or acronym actually is three words that go together,

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,640
HMO, and they're very, very common when you're talking about healthcare.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Marco- Right.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
So an HMO means health maintenance organization.

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,400
Katarina- Okay, and so this is a part of the health insurance topic where we're talking

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,440
about a company that will provide health insurance.

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,600
Marco- Right, so it's a company that provides health insurance, basically.

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,120
And if you go up to an HMO, some of the information that you'll receive is, for example, what

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
your co-pay will be.

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,240
Katarina- Okay, so sometimes with a private option, when you pay a company to give you

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,120
health insurance, you can get a lower rate if you help pay for some of your care.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,560
So for example, a co-pay on a broken arm might be $20, but you pay $20, that's your

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,040
co-pay, and your health insurance company pays the rest.

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,640
And so sometimes co-pays are really high, they're really big, and that's kind of a bad

60
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,080
deal because if you hurt yourself, you don't want to pay a lot.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,880
But sometimes there's no co-pay, in which case your company will pay for all of the

62
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
coverage.

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,600
Marco- All right, so another very similar word is a deductible.

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,560
Katarina- Okay, so a deductible is something that is fixed and it's in your insurance policy.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,120
That means in the contract that you make with the insurance company, the deductible will

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
be stated.

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,880
So for example, my insurance plan, I have maybe a $500 deductible.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,920
That means that in any situation, I get hurt or I get sick, I pay for the first $500 of

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,360
care and then my insurance company pays for the rest.

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,060
So if I have to have a $1,000 surgery, I pay $500 and then my insurance company pays the

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,060
other $500.

72
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,160
Marco- Okay, very good.

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,040
And well, you have these deductibles and everything and that depends on your coverage, right?

74
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,600
So coverage, how much the HMO covers you.

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Katarina- That's right.

76
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,920
And so you can find this also in your contract with your insurance company and coverage will

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,240
include or not include something.

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,520
So coverage, for example, in a healthcare plan does not usually include your teeth.

79
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,440
That's a separate kind of insurance.

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:15,480
But a coverage can include emergency evacuation from a situation or ambulances, for example.

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,560
And so coverage is what is included in your insurance plan.

82
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
Marco- Okay, very good.

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,000
And our last word for today is to qualify for.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Katarina- All right.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,480
So you might have heard this phrase before in the context of sports or academics.

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,200
So he qualified for a scholarship or she qualified for the varsity volleyball team.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,280
But in this case, to qualify for is to be able to use.

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,880
Marco- To be eligible for.

89
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Katarina- To be eligible for.

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,000
Marco- So sometimes HMOs like in, for example, the United States will not accept a person

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,560
who has maybe some health problems already because that would be too much of a risk,

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
right?

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
For the company.

94
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
All right.

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Katarina- That's right.

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Or you could qualify for a reduced rate because you have a very good health history.

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Marco- Okay.

98
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
So this is very interesting.

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,920
And we have a couple of other phrases that are very related to this language.

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,520
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder.

101
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Katarina- Fluency Builder.

102
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,480
Marco- All right.

103
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,840
So in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at our first phrase.

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,680
We got to talking for a while.

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Katarina- Okay.

106
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,480
We could say, for example, we started talking or we were talking for a while.

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,240
But this is a very spoken language kind of phrase where we'd say, we got to talking.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Marco- Right.

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,320
So it's not really grammatically correct because you would say we started talking.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,680
But sometimes people say we got to talking.

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,640
So we got into a conversation, right?

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Katarina- That's right.

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,840
And usually it's about something.

114
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,520
So we could say, yeah, we got to talking about how we both went to the same high school.

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,640
Or we got to talking about this movie that we both saw.

116
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Marco- Okay.

117
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
Very good.

118
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,400
And well, they got to talking for a while and apparently his friend was in a bit of

119
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
a jam.

120
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Katarina- Okay.

121
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Jam is a food.

122
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
You can eat it.

123
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
You put it on bread.

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Marco- Like marmalade, right?

125
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Katarina- Exactly.

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,320
And to be in a jam is a fix or a difficult situation.

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,440
So it has a very different meaning and I want to warn you about that first.

128
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,800
But to be in a jam or to be in a bit of a jam is to be stuck.

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,880
Marco- Okay.

130
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
So you're in a difficult situation.

131
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
You have some problem.

132
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Katarina- Yeah.

133
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,560
So, Marco, I'm in a bit of a jam here.

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Can I get your help with something?

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Marco- All right.

136
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Very good.

137
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Okay.

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,080
And then the guy was talking about insurance and he said, this really got me thinking.

139
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,960
So we got the verb got again there.

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Katarina- All right.

141
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
So got me thinking.

142
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,760
That means I started thinking about something.

143
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,800
So when we were talking about jam a minute ago, it got me thinking about how much I love

144
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
breakfast.

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
Marco- Very good.

146
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,640
So you would use it in that way, right?

147
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Katarina- Like it reminded me.

148
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,680
Marco- It reminded me or I started to really think about something.

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,760
Okay.

150
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,160
And our last phrase is a pre-existing illness.

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
Katarina- All right.

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,400
So to exist is to be, to be around, pre-existing means existing before something else.

153
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,200
And so you often hear this in terms of insurance when someone asks you about your pre-existing

154
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,320
condition.

155
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,840
So that means if I'm signing up for an insurance plan, health insurance plan, and I have an

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,520
interview with you, Marco, and you ask me this question.

157
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,720
Marco- What is your pre-existing condition?

158
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,240
Katarina- That means what diseases or health problems do I have right now?

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Prior to signing up for this insurance.

160
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
And I say, Oh, I don't have any.

161
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,200
And you're very happy because that means I'll be cheap.

162
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,800
But if I say, Oh, I have diabetes, then that is something that the insurance companies

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,680
don't like because it's expensive.

164
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Marco- Right.

165
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Because you're more probable of getting sick or something like that.

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Katarina- Right.

167
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,360
So diabetes or cancer or Lyme disease, these are all pre-existing conditions.

168
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,960
And usually pre-existing conditions are diseases or health problems that you have that won't

169
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
go away.

170
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Marco- Okay.

171
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Very good.

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
All right.

173
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,560
So we have a lot of words, a lot of phrases here.

174
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,240
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back.

175
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,560
Hey, honey, how was your day?

176
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
It was all right.

177
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,000
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,360
He's in a bit of a jam.

179
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Why?

180
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
What happened?

181
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,880
Well, his son had an accident.

182
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
Bill doesn't have health insurance.

183
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
This really got me thinking.

184
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,240
And I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.

185
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,120
Yeah, you're right.

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,880
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

187
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Exactly.

188
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,720
I searched on the web and found a couple of HMOs with low copays and good coverage.

189
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,600
The deductibles are low too.

190
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Sounds good.

191
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,240
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?

192
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,760
Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

194
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,760
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.

195
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,960
Not in a million years.

196
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
All right.

197
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,000
So the health care issue is pretty heated debate now in the United States because many

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,080
people don't have health care and it's not very accessible, right?

199
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
That's right.

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,240
It's a huge debate because it's very, very divided by party lines.

201
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,840
We say there's the Republicans on the right and there's the Democrats on the left and

202
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,760
the Democrats want a public health care option.

203
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,240
They want health care to be available for everyone for free.

204
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,900
And many of them do.

205
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,400
And a lot of Republicans say, no, it should be private because if it's private, there's

206
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,420
competition and that means there's better health care.

207
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,680
And so there's a really big debate and people are getting very angry about it.

208
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Yeah.

209
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,680
And I think it's something that's very interesting and most importantly, seeing the difference

210
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,160
of health care systems around the world, right?

211
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,040
So for example, our listeners, they are from everywhere in the world.

212
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,120
So we would like to know what the health care system is like there.

213
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,360
Do you have free universal health care in your country or do you also have to pay for

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,560
private companies or private health insurance?

215
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,840
And if you have one or the other system, do you think it's a good thing?

216
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Do you think it's a bad thing?

217
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
What do you think needs some work?

218
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Right.

219
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,880
I definitely agree with universal health care.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,120
I think it's a relief because it's like one thing less to worry about.

221
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,560
I can't imagine like, you know, if I don't have health care right now and I'm not covered

222
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,920
by a private company and something happens to me tomorrow, then you know, what's going

223
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
to happen?

224
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
And I think it's a basic human right personally.

225
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,560
So I think it's in the best interests of a country to invest in it because it means that

226
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,040
their people are more productive and happier.

227
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
And healthier.

228
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Yeah.

229
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
All right.

230
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
So that's all the time we have for today.
