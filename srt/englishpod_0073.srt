00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,840
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,800
And today we're at a wedding ceremony.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,680
Alright, nice!

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
Another nice wedding.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,680
But of course, it wouldn't be EnglishPod unless we have something unexpected happening at

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
this wedding.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,200
Okay, so we're going to be talking about hands.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,600
But Marco, what is there to say about a hand?

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,480
Well, as you may or may not know, each finger has a name on your hand.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
Okay.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,000
So we're going to learn what those names are in English.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Perfect.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,840
And also, we're going to learn about some common phrases that you might hear in an English

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
wedding.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Exactly.

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,800
Because I think, exactly because usually it's old English.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,440
Maybe English that's not used anymore.

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Alright.

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,200
Well, I'm excited to find out what this unexpected event is.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,720
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:07,760
The rings, please.

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,120
May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,400
continue in love until life's end.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,480
For this ring I be wed, wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,280
Honey, that's my pinky.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,520
That ring goes on the ring finger.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
This one?

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,960
That's my index finger.

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,760
Oh, right.

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,480
This one, right?

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,160
That's the thumb make.

35
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,600
Okay, I got it.

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,440
This is the ring finger.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,280
That's my middle finger, Nick.

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,600
This is my ring finger.

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:09,840
Alright, embarrassing moments for the groom.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Yes.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,360
Confusing the fingers in front of all his friends and family.

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Not good.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,880
We mentioned before that we're going to learn the names of each finger in your hand, so

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
let's get started.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,320
Let's take a look at these in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,240
Alright, well, why don't we start with the smallest finger on your hand?

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,560
The smallest finger on your hand.

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,520
That's called the pinky.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,600
Sometimes people call it the little finger, right?

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,400
So the pinky.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,800
And the next finger is the one the groom couldn't find.

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Okay, the ring finger.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
The ring finger.

55
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,360
So this is, of course, like the name says, where the wedding ring is usually placed.

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Exactly.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
On this finger.

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,700
Now, the next one is a controversial finger.

59
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,880
That must be the middle finger.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
Okay, easy.

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
Middle finger.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,600
So why is it controversial?

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,640
Well, you know, if you put your middle finger up and you put all...

64
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,440
Like you're doing right now to me.

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm sorry, Marco.

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I'll do it this way.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,680
And all other fingers down, you are making a very rude gesture, a rude sign.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,080
So what would you call that?

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,480
I would call that giving the middle finger.

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Giving the middle finger.

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,560
Or, I've also heard the phrase, flip someone off.

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes, or also flip the bird.

73
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
Flip the bird, exactly.

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
Or give him the bird.

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Yes.

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,680
So these are all phrases that you can use when you are showing only your middle finger

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
to somebody.

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
It's not very polite.

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
No, don't do it.

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Don't do it.

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Unless somebody deserves it, I guess.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,200
We won't talk about that.

83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,040
But what we will talk about is the next finger.

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,320
The index finger.

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,840
The index finger.

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Index finger.

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
So this is the finger you use to point.

88
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Right.

89
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Yeah.

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
The index finger.

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,200
Any idea why they call it the index finger?

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,560
Because when you're looking through the index of a book, you always use this finger.

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Right.

94
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,240
I think you also use this finger to pass pages on a book, right?

95
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Yeah.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay.

97
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Don't believe anything I just told you.

98
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Well, we're not sure.

99
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Maybe you guys know the real answer to this.

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
All right.

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,320
And our last finger, the most important one.

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
The thumb.

103
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Thumb.

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
T-H-U-M-B.

105
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
The thumb.

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Thumb.

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Okay.

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,480
So that's the short but fat finger.

109
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,600
The very movable one.

110
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
The movable one.

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
The one that you use to play PlayStation.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Video games.

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,240
So the pronunciation here, do you say the B at the end of this word?

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
No.

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,480
I actually only pronounce the M. The thumb.

118
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
The thumb.

119
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Yeah.

120
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
You wouldn't say the thumb.

121
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
No.

122
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Okay.

123
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,320
So now that we're clear on all five fingers, let's listen to our dialogue again and then

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:00,520
we'll come back and talk about these difficult phrases that the priest used.

125
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,560
The rings, please.

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,920
May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and

127
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,240
continue in love until life's end.

128
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,160
With this ring I, thee wed, wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

129
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,080
Honey, that's my pinky.

130
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,320
The ring goes on the ring finger.

131
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
This one?

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,760
That's my index finger.

133
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh, right.

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,280
This one, right?

135
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
That's the thumb, Nick.

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Okay.

137
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,360
I got it.

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,180
This is the ring finger.

139
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,000
That's my middle finger, Nick.

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,440
This is my ring finger.

141
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,200
Well, this is really common wedding speak, isn't it?

142
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Yeah.

143
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
It's really common.

144
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,680
That's what usually the priest or the person who is marrying somebody would say.

145
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,920
Well, why don't we look at some of these phrases now because it's really interesting to talk

146
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,080
about their meaning.

147
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,240
So the first one, may this ring be blessed.

148
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,440
May this ring be blessed.

149
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
May this ring be blessed.

150
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
So what does it mean when you bless something or someone?

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Well, usually the religious leader does this, right?

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,480
And he's giving good wishes to that thing.

153
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Could be for an object or to a person, right?

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes.

155
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah.

156
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,400
And so these good wishes usually come from God.

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Okay.

158
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Great.

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,040
So what about our next phrase?

160
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
Abide in peace.

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,760
Abide in peace.

162
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Abide in peace.

163
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Wow.

164
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,080
So this verb, abide.

165
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
It means to live.

166
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
To live.

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Yeah.

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
To be.

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
To be in peace.

170
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Yeah.

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
But it's very fancy and I don't know if you use it anymore.

172
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
No.

173
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,960
I mean, you would never use this word in conversation or even very rarely in writing.

174
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
It's quite old.

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes.

176
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Definitely.

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I would agree.

178
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
So abide in peace.

179
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Okay.

180
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
What about our next phrase?

181
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,200
I like this and it's the common phrase you'll hear in all movies and in all marriages.

182
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Yeah.

183
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,160
With this ring, I thee wed.

184
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
With this ring, I thee wed.

185
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
With this ring, I thee wed.

186
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay.

187
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,840
We've got two words in here that are also older English words.

188
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
So thee.

189
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Thee.

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
T-H-E-E.

191
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
T-H-E-E.

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
Thee.

193
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,520
So this is a middle English term for you.

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
You.

195
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Yes.

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Right?

197
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,280
So can I say, I love thee?

198
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
You could.

199
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
That would be very romantic.

200
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,200
But also inappropriate for the office.

201
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
But it's very old English.

202
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,640
I guess if you're reading Shakespeare, you would definitely come upon this, right?

203
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Yes.

204
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,680
And what about wed?

205
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,520
This is also an old word for, an old verb for the action of marrying someone.

206
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,400
So I can say, we will be wed next year.

207
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
But don't say that now because you'll sound quite silly.

208
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Yeah.

209
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
It's too old-fashioned.

210
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Yeah, I guess so.

211
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,080
But it's good to know, especially if you guys are reading something a little bit more classical.

212
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
Or you plan to get married to an English person.

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,520
All right.

214
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
And our last phrase.

215
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,480
Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

217
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,440
So now he's referring to the rings, right?

218
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,960
Wear the ring as a symbol.

219
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
A sign.

220
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
A representation.

221
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Yes.

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
Of love and commitment.

223
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,480
So why would you wear a ring as a symbol of something?

224
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,800
Well obviously, you know, love, you can't see it, you can't touch it.

225
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Right.

226
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,040
So you need something to show you that it's there.

227
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,720
So you need a sign of that love.

228
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Something that you can see.

229
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
So that's what the ring represents.

230
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Yeah.

231
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,120
But how about this word, commitment?

232
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,680
A commitment is a strong promise.

233
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,880
So you promise to love that person, to take care of them, etc.

234
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Yeah.

235
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Okay, great.

236
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,680
So now we are a little bit more familiar with some of the language you hear in a wedding

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,400
ceremony.

238
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,680
And we also know all of the names of the fingers.

239
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Exactly.

240
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:12,440
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to hear these all in context.

241
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:23,480
The rings please.

242
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,840
May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and

243
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,160
continue in love until life's end.

244
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,920
And may this ring I be wed wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

245
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Honey, that's my pinky.

246
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,240
That ring goes on the ring finger.

247
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
This one?

248
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,680
That's my index finger.

249
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,480
Oh, right.

250
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
This one, right?

251
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
That's the thumb make.

252
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,320
Okay, I got it.

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
This is the ring finger.

254
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
That's my middle finger, Nick.

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,760
This is my ring finger.

256
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:25,120
All right, so now it's perfectly clear and a romantic dialogue in the end.

257
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Yeah, very romantic.

258
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Although a little bit embarrassing.

259
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Yeah.

260
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,440
So what about wedding rings?

261
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
Now we have different types of rings, right?

262
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,120
We have the wedding ring, the one that we just heard, but we also have an engagement

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
ring.

264
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Yes, yeah.

265
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,400
In most English speaking countries, the woman is very, very lucky because she gets two rings.

266
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,920
So when the man asks her to marry him, he gives her a diamond.

267
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
A diamond ring.

268
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,480
That is usually, that's the engagement ring.

269
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,040
And it's really, really important that he does this.

270
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,160
And it's also really important that he spends a lot of money on the diamond.

271
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,840
Yeah, I know about this.

272
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Weddings are forever, right?

273
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Yes.

274
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,160
And the tradition is you must spend at least one month's salary.

275
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Wow.

276
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Is that it?

277
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah.

278
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,520
So the girl gets a diamond engagement ring, and then on wedding day, she gets the wedding

279
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
ring.

280
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Yes.

281
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,720
And usually, will she wear both of them?

282
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,400
Yeah, she'll always wear both of them.

283
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,920
So the engagement ring goes closest to you, and then the wedding ring on top.

284
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
And the engagement ring, it represents?

285
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,520
The commitment to marry her.

286
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,560
No, wait, the commitment from the man to marry her.

287
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,840
Okay, so it's a symbol that they will get married.

288
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,080
Yes, it's a symbol of the promise.

289
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Now what happens if they break up and they don't get married?

290
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Does he get the ring back?

291
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,560
I don't know.

292
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,260
Okay, here's the rule.

293
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,640
If he was a jerk, no.

294
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,800
But if it was sort of like a happy breakup, then okay.

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Okay.

296
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
I guess it's a big risk, right?

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Yeah.

298
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
All right.

299
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
That's it for today, guys.

300
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,120
Let us know if you guys have any interesting wedding stories.

301
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,200
I know that sometimes weddings can be embarrassing, people, I don't know, objecting, maybe I've

302
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
seen the groom faint.

303
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Or even fall in a pool.

304
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
Fall in a pool.

305
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
So if you have any stories, please share them with us.

306
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
