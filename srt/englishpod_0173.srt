00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,080
And my name is Catherine and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson all about

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
money.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
That's right.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,600
We are going to be talking about money but most importantly we need to start saving money.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,120
We need to spend less.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Exactly.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,440
So, in order to control spending today we're talking about budgeting.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,520
So let's take a look at this very important word in today's vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,760
Alright, so as you mentioned, budgeting is, what is to budget?

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,040
To budget, that's the verb.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,240
So budgeting is deciding how to spend your money, okay?

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,960
So that means that we prepare a plan for how to spend money.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,120
Alright, so that can be a noun and a verb.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,560
A budget is the plan on how you're going to spend money and to budget is to execute this

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
plan.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Exactly.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,260
So, today we're budgeting a family's spending.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,320
We're trying to control how much this family will spend in the future.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,800
Alright, very good.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:13,640
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,360
Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Carnwell.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Please take a seat.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Thank you.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,280
So, I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,640
Yes, that's correct.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,880
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high and we have never had any

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,720
money problems, but I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,040
of control.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,400
We have two kids and with allowances paying their credit cards, ours, and not to mention

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,480
our mortgage and car payments.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,720
With the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need some

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,640
advice as how we can prepare a family budget.

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
I see.

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,760
Well, you have come to the right place.

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,480
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,000
Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,120
such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
Yes, that makes sense.

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,000
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,960
are spending money on the most.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,600
Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that, but we can usually

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,720
trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Great!

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,120
We will do that then.

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,400
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
That's another thing.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
cards.

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Alright, we're back.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,560
So there were some interesting words and phrases in this dialogue related to budgeting and

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,360
a lot of financial terms here.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,360
So let's get started now on Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
Language Takeaway

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,960
This first term is very important because it tells us what kind of a budget we're talking

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
about.

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,240
We're not talking about a company here.

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,880
We're talking about a family.

61
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,240
And so in this case, we use the phrase household.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,440
So what are we talking about?

63
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Household income.

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,160
Alright, so income we know is the amount of money that comes in to maybe your wallet,

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,000
my income, my personal income.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,360
That's how much money you earn.

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,720
So a household income is how much money the house earns.

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
So all the people that are living in this house, right?

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
That's right.

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
So it could be a family.

71
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,600
It could be two married people who are married to each other.

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,520
So the idea is that it's not one person's income.

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,000
It's the household income.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Think of a house.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,520
Alright, so it's the combined income of everyone that's living there or that's making money

76
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
that lives in this house.

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Right.

78
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,240
So if Marco and I have a household, I earn $10,000 and he earns $10,000.

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,080
Our household income is $20,000.

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Very good.

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Alright.

82
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,320
So now we know what our household income is and in this case we have children and we give

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,480
our kids an allowance.

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,240
Okay so I had an allowance when I was a kid.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,340
This is the amount of money I got from my parents every week.

86
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,280
So I get I think $10 a week and I could spend it on anything I wanted and I didn't have

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,000
to work because my parents gave the money to me.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And so an allowance is this money.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,800
It's the money that mom and dad give to their children maybe every month or maybe every

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
week.

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Now it's not only related to children, right?

92
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Because maybe if you have a brother or maybe you're married and your wife is a housewife,

93
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,240
maybe you give her an allowance, right?

94
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Or the opposite.

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,560
Maybe you're a house husband and you get an allowance from your wife.

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
That's right.

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
You can have an allowance if you're anyone.

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,640
You can also have an allowance from your company if you go traveling.

99
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,200
So if you have a business trip, your company gives you a food allowance.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,040
That's the amount of money you can spend on food.

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
And you don't have to work for it.

102
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
That's the best part.

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Awesome.

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,320
Alright so after these allowances, they were talking about how the economic downturn has

105
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,000
affected their income and their spending.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,080
Okay so down, you think this is a negative thing.

107
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
You're right.

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,800
Downturn means when a situation gets worse or slows down.

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,280
And in this case, the economy is what got worse.

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,520
And you remember this from last year.

111
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,080
Things started to get very difficult for people who are in business.

112
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
And this has affected families.

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,360
And so we call this situation an economic downturn.

114
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Now the opposite would be an economic boom.

115
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
That's right.

116
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,520
A boom is when things are going well.

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,280
That means people are earning more money.

118
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
There are more jobs.

119
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Alright.

120
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Very good.

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,920
Now moving on, as they were talking about budgeting, they mentioned this very important

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,560
word, very technical, is to allocate money into different areas.

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
That's right.

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Allocate spending.

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
This is a verb.

126
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
To allocate.

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
That means to decide where the money will go.

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,520
Okay so as the mother in a family, I will allocate 10% of the money to the children's

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
allowances.

130
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
That's a lot.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
50% to the mortgage.

132
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,960
20% to the car.

133
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
Car repairs.

134
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,200
So you're allocating your spending.

135
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
That's right.

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm deciding where to spend the money.

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,200
And well, talking about spending, we have this word, expenditures.

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Expenditures.

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,840
And so this is a really important word if you're in business as well because we consider

140
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,780
expenditures when we're talking about how much a company earns.

141
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,560
Expenditures are things that we spend money on.

142
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,800
So remember that word, expenditures.

143
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Spend.

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Okay.

145
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
So an expenditure.

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,360
That's a noun and usually it's in the plural.

147
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Expenditures.

148
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Exactly.

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Expenditures.

150
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,240
So we have many expenditures at my house.

151
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,520
Among them, we have the car, the rent, healthcare, things like that.

152
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Okay.

153
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Perfect.

154
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,000
So really good phrases there.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,400
Really good vocabulary items.

156
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,160
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder.

157
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Fluency Builder.

158
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
We've got some very fun phrases today, Marco, in Fluency Builder.

159
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,920
This first one is a very common phrase that we hear in songs and movies.

160
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
To skyrocket.

161
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
To skyrocket.

162
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
All right.

163
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
What is skyrocket?

164
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,820
Well, you think about a rocket, you know, that's a ship that goes to space.

165
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,200
To skyrocket means to go up really high, really fast.

166
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,400
The price of gas has skyrocketed.

167
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,640
So I remember when I was a kid, gas used to be 98 cents a gallon.

168
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,680
And in the 2000s, the price skyrocketed and it ended up being like $4 a gallon.

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,200
Yeah, it was really expensive.

170
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
All right.

171
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,080
So this is also, you can talk about sales have skyrocketed or the price of petroleum

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
has skyrocketed.

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
So it could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're talking about.

174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
All right.

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,240
And now moving on, they said that their spending was out of control.

176
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Yeah.

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,560
So this family doesn't seem to understand how to budget.

178
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,740
They spend on everything.

179
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,980
And so the accountant says that your spending is out of control.

180
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,960
That means that you're spending too much.

181
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,480
There's no order to the way that you're spending.

182
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,560
And we actually have a lesson, a previous lesson called out of control spending that

183
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,280
we also touched this topic of what we talk about out of control.

184
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Something is out of control.

185
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,880
A person can be out of control.

186
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Like a child.

187
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
This child is out of control.

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
He never stops screaming and hitting people.

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
All right.

190
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,520
And our last phrase for today, the accountant says, well, you've come to the right place.

191
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Okay.

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
This is him.

193
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
This is the accountant bragging.

194
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,240
He's saying, well, I can fix your problems.

195
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
I can help you.

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
You've come to the right place.

197
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
You can use this in many different ways.

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,640
For example, I have a problem maybe with my TV and I say, Marco, oh my gosh, my TV doesn't

199
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
work.

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
I don't know what to do.

201
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Can you help?

202
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Right.

203
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
And I can say, well, you've come to the right place.

204
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm an expert in my TV.

205
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Marco's an expert in electronics.

206
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm an expert.

207
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
All right.

208
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
So, you've come to the right place.

209
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,280
It's a very common phrase, especially as you say when somebody's trying to brag and say,

210
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,680
well, I know how to fix your problems or I know what you need.

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,240
I'm good at this.

212
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,480
You've come to the right place.

213
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
If you want to learn English, you've come to the right place.

214
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Exactly.

215
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
EnglishPod.com.

216
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
All right.

217
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:24,600
So, let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

218
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,280
Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Carnwell.

219
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Please take a seat.

220
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Thank you.

221
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,160
So, I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.

222
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,560
Yes, that's correct.

223
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,760
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high and we have never had any

224
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
money problems.

225
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,960
But I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.

226
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,320
We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, ours, and not to mention

227
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,360
our mortgage and car payments.

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
With the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need some

229
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,520
advice as how we can prepare a family budget.

230
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
I see.

231
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,600
Well, you have come to the right place.

232
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow.

233
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,920
Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories

234
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,960
such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.

235
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,680
Yes, that makes sense.

236
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,520
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.

237
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,920
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you

238
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,880
are spending money on the most.

239
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,920
Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that.

240
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,520
But we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.

241
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Great!

242
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,000
We will do that then.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,280
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

244
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
That's another thing.

245
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,980
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit

246
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,560
cards.

247
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Alright we're back.

248
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,040
So now talking about allowances, you said you had an allowance when you were a kid.

249
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,720
Did you really have a $10 a week allowance?

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,000
No, I think it was like $8.

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,680
It started out at $6 or $5 a week and then I think the most I got was like $10 or $11.

252
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,440
So it was like almost about a dollar a day.

253
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
About that.

254
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,560
But usually the point was that, well, I started working when I was 15 because my parents thought

255
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,400
it was important for children to learn how money works.

256
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,840
But I was given that money because at the time it was enough money to go out one night.

257
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,680
So on Friday nights if I wanted to go out with my friends, I could go out to watch a

258
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,800
movie and get a slice of pizza and $10 was enough.

259
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,220
Now $10 doesn't even buy you a ticket to the movie.

260
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,160
But at the time it was more than enough.

261
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,560
So this is important I guess because different families have different ways of upbringing

262
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,240
their children and in many cases this doesn't happen.

263
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,720
If I want to go out to the movies on a Saturday, then my parents will give me $30.

264
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,880
And if I want to go out next weekend, they'll also give me money.

265
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,960
So it's interesting to see the contrast because obviously when I was a kid also I didn't really

266
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
get this opportunity of going out all the time.

267
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,560
And actually I had to work for it.

268
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,960
So if I wanted to go out on the weekend, I would get an allowance but also I would have

269
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
to wash the car, that was typical with my dad.

270
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
I had to wash the car.

271
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,600
Well, I think it's interesting because it shows that the parents want to teach their

272
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,560
children about budgeting.

273
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,960
Because if you only have $10, you really have to budget.

274
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,000
You have to decide how you will allocate that money even though it's not very much.

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,760
So in some ways it's good practice.

276
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Yeah, it is.

277
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
I think it's done us well.

278
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
We're not in debt.

279
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Not yet.

280
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
All right.

281
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,520
So let us know how allowances work in your country or maybe did you have an allowance

282
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
when you were a kid?

283
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
A lot of people didn't have an allowance.

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,960
I know a lot of friends didn't get allowances.

285
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,240
