00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,240
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,320
And my name is Kathryn.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,960
And today we've got a great show for you.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,640
We're talking all about music.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
It's a great topic.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,840
I think everyone loves music and well, there's so much type of music out there.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,760
So that's what we're going to be talking about today.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Exactly.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,880
So there's a little bit for everyone here.

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,440
Even if you hate rock music, there might be something in it that you're going to be a

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
fan of.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Right.

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,360
So before we get started on the dialogue, we have a couple of words that we want to

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
preview.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
So let's take a look at them now in Vocabulary Preview.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Vocabulary Preview.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
All right.

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,680
So this word sounds a bit funny.

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,000
It looks like it should be pronounced differently.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We say genre.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Genre.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Or genre.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
It kind of sounds French.

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,600
I think it comes from French.

27
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,320
It's a GE word.

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
So genre.

29
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,360
It's a soft, soft sound.

30
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,720
And what's a genre?

31
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,200
Well, a genre is like a category.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,760
So you could say genre of book or genre of music.

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,520
Oh, movies also have genres, right?

34
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Yeah, they do.

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,240
Like horror movie is a genre.

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Okay.

37
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Or action or suspense, etc.

38
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,520
So we're going to be looking at music genres on this occasion.

39
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,440
And some of these genre names actually have abbreviations.

40
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,160
They're long words that we say in short forms.

41
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,480
And this kind of abbreviation is called an acronym.

42
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
All right.

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,920
So that's another word that we're looking at, acronym.

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,840
So an acronym is a short version of a long word.

45
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,120
Yeah, usually it's just letters.

46
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,600
Like USA is a very good acronym.

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,200
It means United States of America.

48
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
All right.

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Cool.

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,320
So there are some acronyms as well in music.

51
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
So that's what we're going to be looking at.

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
And many other things.

53
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,240
I guess like DNA is an acronym.

54
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,080
Yeah, DNA is an acronym.

55
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,480
UN is an acronym.

56
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
All right.

57
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Great.

58
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,920
So we're going to be looking at different genres of music.

59
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,840
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:14,760
We're going to listen to a game show where people have to name the song and the genre.

61
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,280
Welcome back music lovers to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
to the extreme.

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
Let's get started.

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,640
Team A, guess this tune.

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:34,760
Carrying Your Love With Me by George Strait.

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,080
The genre is country music.

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
You're right.

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
100 points to Team A. Now for our next cut.

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Thong Song by Sisqó.

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
I believe the genre is R&B.

71
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,520
100 big points for Team B. For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm

72
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,640
and blues.

73
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,400
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

74
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Superstar by The Carpenters.

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,840
And the genre?

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
Adult Contemporary.

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,120
That's right, 100 points.

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,680
That sound means it's double or nothing.

79
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,320
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

80
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,880
Let's hear our next song.

81
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,320
Too Easy.

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,680
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
You are correct.

84
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,720
Very impressive, Team A. And it seems we have a tie.

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,760
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,880
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less

87
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,160
than five seconds.

88
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Team A, are you ready?

89
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Ready.

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Let's hear it.

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:11,600
Hip hop, classical and gothic metal.

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
You're right.

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,280
Team B, the pressure is on.

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,640
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,600
If you miss one, you lose.

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,600
DJ, let's hear it.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Rap, disco and...

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Fun show, Marco.

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,640
I kind of think I'd be good at this kind of game.

100
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,440
I might win big.

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,400
Well, there were a lot of different types of genres in there and a lot of different

102
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,200
music, I don't know, maybe not very popular.

103
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,880
Like for example, country music.

104
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,840
I don't know if many people outside of the United States actually know about this.

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Well, there might be different kinds of country music, but you know, in America, one of the

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,840
most famous country music musicians is Garth Brooks.

107
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,320
And even if I didn't like his music, I grew up hearing it everywhere.

108
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
But you don't like it?

109
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,840
Um, you know, it's one of those things that I like some kinds of country music, but it's

110
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,680
a huge genre.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,160
That means there's lots of different kinds of music within country.

112
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
All right.

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,440
So let's take a look at more of these genres and now in Language Takeaway.

114
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Language Takeaway.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,000
All right.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,880
So we talked about country music.

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
Now this is mostly in the United States, right?

118
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,880
In the South, especially because there's a long tradition of country music in the southern

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
United States.

120
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,920
So it's very characteristic to have guitars and...

121
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,200
A little bit of twang, maybe.

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Twang?

123
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,520
What is twang?

124
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,320
It's a way of saying a word.

125
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,600
So I could say, I'm from Texas, or I could say, I'm from Texas.

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
That's twang.

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
That's twang.

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,080
So kind of like an accent, a southern accent.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Yeah.

130
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,080
So Garth Brooks has a famous twang, I got friends in Laos.

131
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,280
You know, that's a very famous song of his where he's twangy.

132
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Very southern.

133
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Yeah.

134
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
All right.

135
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,200
So we have country music and then we saw another genre, which is R&B.

136
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay.

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,960
This is a little bit more up my alley.

138
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,040
That means this is more of an interest of mine.

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,600
And R&B is an acronym for?

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Rhythm and blues.

141
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
All right.

142
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,560
So the R&B that we know now, what would be some examples of those artists?

143
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, a really famous artist is John Legend, who's been touring the world with his new

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,800
album and that kind of music is R&B.

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,260
So we're talking about a kind of music that mixes jazz traditions with rhythm.

146
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,560
So that means drums and bass.

147
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Okay.

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
That's rhythm.

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,640
So you have rhythm and blues, like the name says.

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,240
R&B, very popular nowadays.

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,000
And then we moved on to something heavier, something more like rock style, which is metal.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Metal.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm not really sure why they call it metal, but metal is a very, very popular kind of

155
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
music.

156
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,480
So it divides into different categories, right?

157
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,840
In this song, we saw that it was power metal.

158
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Yeah.

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,960
But you also have like heavy metal.

160
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, because metal is such a broad category, it's a big category.

161
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,440
It's hard to say what certain groups are unless you're really a fan and you follow, but there

162
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,800
are many different kinds of metal out there.

163
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,280
And so if you're interested, I would check it out on Wikipedia.

164
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Yeah.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,600
Or let us know if you know what's the difference between power metal and gothic metal and electronic

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
metal.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
So there are so many different types now.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,120
But moving on to our next genre, we also saw something that everyone probably knows nowadays

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,600
and that's hip hop.

170
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Yeah.

171
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,760
Hip hop is a great, great and very interesting kind of music.

172
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,800
It grew out of a lot of people who are listening to jazz in the late 80s, especially in New

173
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,920
York, I think, Brooklyn.

174
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,160
And it's kind of interesting in the sense that you take these old records, these old

175
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,480
vinyls, and you slow everything down.

176
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Right.

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Right.

178
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
So you change the speed.

179
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,880
So a normal song goes from dum, dum, dum, dum to dum, dum, dum, dum.

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
And then you had like some bass in there.

181
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Yeah, exactly.

182
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,200
And some lyrics and you have yourself something like hip hop.

183
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,200
So a very famous hip hop artist nowadays would be 50 Cent.

184
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Yeah.

185
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Or for example, also Nelly, right?

186
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Another famous hip hop artist.

187
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Yeah.

188
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,520
So we have hip hop and well, it's kind of similar.

189
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
I don't know.

190
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,920
Very similar to rap almost.

191
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Yeah.

192
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,080
But it's different in that the way the process for making this kind of music is quite different.

193
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Yeah.

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,960
Rap tends to be very lyric heavy, whereas hip hop is very beat heavy, I think.

195
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Right.

196
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
So interesting.

197
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,080
Now we've seen a lot of these different genres, but of course, there's so many more that we

198
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
can't really look at all of them in one single podcast.

199
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
That's what our website's for.

200
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,560
You can put your favorite music genres up on our website and practice your English.

201
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Exactly.

202
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,960
So, well, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the second time?

203
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,720
Let's slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some more

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,600
phrases.

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,840
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical

206
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,920
knowledge to the extreme.

207
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
Let's get started.

208
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Team A, guess this tune.

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,600
Carrying Your Love With Me by George Strait.

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
The genre is country music.

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
You're right.

212
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,000
100 points to Team A. Now for our next cut.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,560
Song Song by Sisqó.

214
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,320
I believe the genre is R&B.

215
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,280
100 big points for Team B.

216
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,880
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

217
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

218
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
Superstar by The Carpenters.

219
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,720
And the genre?

220
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Adult Contemporary.

221
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
That's right.

222
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,920
100 points.

223
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,160
Uh-oh.

224
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
That sound means it's double or nothing.

225
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

226
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,320
Let's hear our next song.

227
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,000
Too easy.

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,320
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

229
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
You are correct.

230
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,360
Very impressive, Team A. And it seems we have a tie.

231
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,520
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

232
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,480
Each team will be played three songs, and they must tell us the genre of each song in

233
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
less than five seconds.

234
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Team A, are you ready?

235
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Ready.

236
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Let's hear it.

237
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,200
Hip-hop, classical, and gothic metal.

238
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,280
You're right.

239
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,960
Team B, the pressure is on.

240
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,280
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

241
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,320
If you miss one, you lose.

242
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,520
DJ, let's hear it.

243
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,360
Rap, disco, and...

244
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,080
So, it isn't a true EnglishPod lesson if we don't give you a couple of phrases and words

245
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,760
to make you sound more fluent, so that's the purpose of this next portion of our show.

246
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Fluency Builder.

247
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,120
Okay, so the phrases that we're going to look at now on Fluency Builder are the ones that

248
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,840
we saw in the dialogue, but we can use, of course, outside of music or outside of a game

249
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,360
show.

250
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,240
And there was an interesting one that he mentioned when he said, double or nothing.

251
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
Hmm, double or nothing.

252
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
It's double or nothing.

253
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Well, this is an interesting phrase because it, I think, comes from gambling and betting.

254
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,680
Yeah, so it's a way for us to say, well, you could double your money, but if you have

255
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,880
a bad answer, if you lose this round, you don't get anything.

256
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,800
So I guess, yeah, you do see a lot of people say, maybe they're betting or they're playing

257
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,780
a game, that person loses and says, okay, let's go double or nothing.

258
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,160
So give me one more shot to win back my money.

259
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Right.

260
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,560
So if I say, okay, Marco, you need to tell me the capital of Brazil, you have $50.

261
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
If you get the answer right, you get $100.

262
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
But if you get the answer wrong, you get zero.

263
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Right.

264
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
That's double or nothing.

265
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,640
All right, interesting phrase.

266
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
What else do we have?

267
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,760
We've got a great one here called tiebreaker.

268
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
So a tiebreaker.

269
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,280
Yeah, a tiebreaker, it's a thing.

270
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,240
And sometimes in games, some people have the same score.

271
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,680
They have the same amount of points.

272
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
So they're tied.

273
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
They're tied.

274
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,100
A tie means you have the same number.

275
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,440
And if you want to win, you need one winner.

276
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,780
You have to have a tiebreaker to decide.

277
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,080
So it could be a question or like we saw here, a tiebreaker round.

278
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah.

279
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,840
So to decide on a winner.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,000
And this is all or nothing because if you get the answer right, you win.

281
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,320
If you don't, you lose.

282
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,520
It doesn't matter if you were tied before.

283
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Right.

284
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
All right.

285
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
A tiebreaker.

286
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,040
And we have one more phrase and this one is really interesting.

287
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,520
The pressure is on.

288
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,400
So if I say the pressure is on.

289
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
It almost sounds painful.

290
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Yeah, it does.

291
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,760
Well, is it, does it mean that I am being pressured or what is this?

292
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
Well, it's a good question.

293
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,160
The important thing to look at here is the word on because pressure has this kind of

294
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,000
companion word to put pressure on something or to put pressure on someone.

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,600
And so it's the way we say it in English and it means that you're going to really take

296
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,120
things seriously from this point on.

297
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Okay.

298
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Right.

299
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,400
So for example, the Chicago Bulls were at the peak, the height of their fame and they

300
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,080
were just a wonderful team.

301
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,160
And oftentimes you'd hear the announcers say, there's five seconds left on the clock.

302
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,320
The pressure is on Michael Jordan to win the game.

303
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
All right.

304
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,200
So the opportunity for the team to win all depended on Michael Jordan.

305
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Right.

306
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,920
So the pressure, all of this stuff is on him, his shoulders.

307
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
So he has to score the point to win the game.

308
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Okay.

309
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,800
This is a very interesting phrase.

310
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,240
Why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use the pressure is on.

311
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,680
Example one.

312
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,600
Carl is really stressed out lately.

313
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,560
The pressure of the entire project is on him since his promotion.

314
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,760
Example two.

315
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:23,200
The pressure is on the president to guide his country out of the recession.

316
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,960
Example three.

317
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,000
The pressure is on our entire team to successfully come up with a new product for the Asian market

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,760
within a month.

319
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
All right.

320
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Great examples.

321
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Great phrases.

322
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I think it's pretty clear now, right?

323
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
It is.

324
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,160
And to make sure that we understood the whole dialogue, I think we should take another listen

325
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,880
to it at a normal speed.

326
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,000
And when we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about one of my favorite topics,

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,160
music.

328
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,680
Welcome back music lovers to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge

329
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
to the extreme.

330
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Let's get started.

331
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Team A, guess this tune.

332
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:19,120
Carrying your love with me by George Strait.

333
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
The genre is country music.

334
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
You're right.

335
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:33,160
100 points to Team A. Now for our next cut.

336
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Song sung by Cisco.

337
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,640
I believe the genre is R&B.

338
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,880
100 big points for Team B. For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm

339
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
and blues.

340
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,200
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

341
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,160
Superstar by the Carpenters.

342
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,200
And the genre?

343
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,800
Adult contemporary.

344
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,920
That's right, 100 points.

345
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,040
Uh-oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

346
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,680
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

347
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
Let's hear our next song.

348
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,680
Too easy.

349
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,040
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

350
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,280
You are correct.

351
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,080
Very impressive, Team A. And it seems we have a tie.

352
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,120
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

353
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,240
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less

354
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
than five seconds.

355
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Team A, are you ready?

356
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Ready.

357
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,680
Let's hear it.

358
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:55,960
Hip hop, classical and gothic metal.

359
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
You're right.

360
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,640
Team B, the pressure is on.

361
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,980
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

362
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,960
If you miss one, you lose.

363
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,960
DJ, let's hear it.

364
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Rap, disco and...

365
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:38,360
All right, so we have music, different music genres.

366
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,520
Which one are you mostly into?

367
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
That's a hard question.

368
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,720
I have very different interests.

369
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
I like classical music.

370
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,000
I also like jazz, but I also like rock and I also like R&B.

371
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So it really depends.

372
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I guess it depends on your mood.

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Absolutely.

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,520
Now, they say that music does really influence people's moods.

375
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,400
They did a study, some doctors in America did a study to see if heart patients, people

376
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,260
who have heart problems, could be positively affected by music.

377
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,400
And the results said that yes, it can be helpful.

378
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh, really?

379
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,160
So maybe it helps them relax or...

380
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,480
Yeah, it says if you're listening to the radio and a song that you like comes on the radio,

381
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,280
you hear the song, your heart pumps more oxygen to your brain.

382
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,400
So it means it actually makes you happier.

383
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Wow.

384
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
What about when they play music for unborn babies?

385
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Like they'll put little headphones on a mother's belly and they'll play like classical music

386
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
because supposedly it'll make the baby smarter.

387
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,520
Like baby Mozart or something.

388
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Yeah, exactly.

389
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
What do you think about that?

390
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,360
I don't know.

391
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,600
I think talking to kids and giving them books when they're little probably helps a little

392
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,680
bit more, but I'm not a doctor so that I can't say.

393
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,480
Well, many people do argue now that they don't make music like they used to.

394
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,520
I guess they say that music that was made before, the lyrics were more profound, they

395
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
were real musicians, they were composers and they wrote lyrics.

396
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,280
But now you just get a lot of temporary music that doesn't really transcend into the future.

397
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
What do you think?

398
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
I totally disagree.

399
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,920
I think the last 10 years have seen a really amazing growth in the music industry because

400
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,280
more people are communicating.

401
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,040
The internet allows us to hear all sorts of things from all over the world and so we have

402
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,840
great musicians who can listen to music from Mali and they can listen to music from India

403
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,800
and they have all these different influences that were not there before.

404
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,400
And so I think it's the opposite.

405
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,040
I think a lot of new pathways in music have opened up because of the technology evolution.

406
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Wow, interesting.

407
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,800
Well, what do you guys think?

408
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,880
Listeners, come to our website EnglishPod.com, leave your questions and comments and tell

409
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
us what you think.

410
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,000
Do you think maybe music has become better in the last decade or do you think maybe it's

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
not so good?

412
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
Well, you do have bad artists, right?

413
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
You always have bad artists.

414
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,240
The bad ones, they fade into history.

415
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,280
You never hear from them again.

416
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,940
So come and let us know and also if you have any questions or doubts, you can leave them
