00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,500
My name is Catherine and today we have part two of our series about small talk in English.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
That's right.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,460
So as we mentioned, small talk are very short, quick conversations about everyday things

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,340
like the weather and usually have this with a colleague very quickly or a friend maybe.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,180
Yeah, maybe not someone you know very well too.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,180
Exactly.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,780
So we're going to take a look at part two.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:35,500
Why don't we listen to the dialogue and see what's going on.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,540
So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,900
She's my colleague from Brazil.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,380
Maria, this is Michelle.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,800
Hi Michelle.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,820
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,020
I mean, what work do you do?

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,400
I work in advertising right now.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,460
How about you?

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm actually in the wine business.

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,940
Oh, that sounds really great.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,020
I love wine myself.

22
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,340
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,580
No, actually I often visit.

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,220
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,240
Also I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,420
So that's a good reason to come.

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,420
Me too.

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,900
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,340
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,060
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,820
We should go there together sometime.

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,820
Wonderful idea.

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,820
I'd love that.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,020
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,140
So now let's take a look at some of these very interesting phrases we find in this dialogue

36
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,160
in Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,620
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,580
So the first phrase we have today is from the first sentence of this dialogue.

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,300
James says, so Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
That's right.

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,260
And the second phrase, introduce someone to or introduce you to.

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,980
Okay, let me introduce you to this person.

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,380
So Marco, let me introduce you to my friend.

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,380
Right.

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,060
And this is something that you say when you want to tell the person, look, you're going

46
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,340
to meet someone new.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,220
Let me introduce you to my friend, Sally.

48
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,780
And this is very important because it's polite and it's a way for you to say, okay, you two

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,340
don't know each other.

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,100
Here, this is this person's name, this is this person's name.

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,100
It's very important when you are introducing people or when you're in a situation with

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,180
two people who don't know each other.

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
That's right.

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
Exactly.

55
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,260
So let me introduce you to someone.

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,300
Now another key question here, I think probably one of the key questions when you meet someone

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,220
new, you're talking, small talk, short conversation, what do you do here or what do you do?

58
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,220
What do you do?

59
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,260
So this might sound like a very strange question.

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
What do you do?

61
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
Do you watch TV?

62
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,740
Do you like to eat food?

63
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,700
No, but this means what job do you do?

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Right.

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,540
What type of work do you do?

66
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,540
Okay.

67
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,540
So Marco, what do you do?

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,340
I host an English podcast.

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,340
All right.

70
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Me too.

71
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,060
So this is the question.

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,420
Now don't get confused and remember that this is the typical way of asking someone what

73
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
is their job.

74
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,260
If you say, what is your job or what is your occupation, what is your occupation?

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,180
It's too formal and it's kind of awkward.

76
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,140
I don't think anyone has ever asked me what is your occupation.

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,460
Now I rarely say that.

78
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,420
I almost always say, what do you do?

79
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,220
Or maybe what type of work do you do?

80
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,460
Or what business are you in?

81
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,220
So this is our next phrase actually.

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Right.

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,100
If someone asks you what business are you in or what industry are you in, you would

84
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,060
say like in this case, Maria, she is in the wine business.

85
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Okay.

86
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,660
I'm in the wine business.

87
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,820
That means that my job has to do with selling or buying wine.

88
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,540
So if we replace the noun wine with something else, for example, clothing.

89
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,620
I'm in the clothing business or I'm in the cheese business.

90
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
Exactly.

91
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,980
You can basically change it with anything.

92
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
With any product.

93
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,740
I guess if you sell computers, I'm in the computer business.

94
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,700
Or if you have anything to do with computers, you can say I'm in the computer business.

95
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
All right.

96
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
So that's great.

97
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
I'm in the hmm business.

98
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Exactly.

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
All right.

100
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,820
So now we know what the person does.

101
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,340
We continue asking questions.

102
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
You know, we're interested.

103
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,500
We want to keep the conversation going a little while longer.

104
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,300
We say, Oh wow, that's really great.

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,020
I love wine myself.

106
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,620
Then we ask, is this your first time to Shanghai?

107
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Okay.

108
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,700
So is this your first time to Shanghai or in Shanghai?

109
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,540
This means is this your first time to visit Shanghai?

110
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
That's right.

111
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,500
The preposition here is always confusing for an ESL learner because sometimes do you say,

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,300
is this your first time in Shanghai?

113
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,620
Is this your first time on Shanghai?

114
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,860
Now we're saying to Shanghai.

115
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,700
So in this case or in this type of question, both are correct.

116
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,140
Is this your first time in Shanghai?

117
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,780
Is this your first time to Shanghai?

118
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
All right.

119
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,400
So I could also say, you know, if we're in Chicago, Hey Marco, is this your first time

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,620
in Chicago?

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,260
But I have to ask if we are in that city.

122
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,020
I can't say, okay, I'm in Chicago today, but Marco, is this your first time in New York?

123
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,700
Because we're not in New York right now.

124
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
That could be confusing.

125
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,100
So remember when you ask this question, you're asking about where you are today, right now.

126
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Exactly.

127
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Very good.

128
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,580
So on that note, let's take a break.

129
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:31,900
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with some more phrases.

130
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,900
So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

131
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,300
She's my colleague from Brazil.

132
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,780
Maria, this is Michelle.

133
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,180
Hi, Michelle.

134
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,220
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

135
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,420
I mean, what work do you do?

136
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,780
I work in advertising right now.

137
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,840
How about you?

138
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,500
I'm actually in the wine business.

139
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,340
Oh, that sounds really great.

140
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,400
I love wine myself.

141
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,740
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

142
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,940
No, actually, I often visit.

143
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,580
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

144
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,620
Also I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

145
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,820
So that's a good reason to come.

146
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Me too.

147
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,260
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

148
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,740
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,480
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

150
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,220
We should go there together sometime.

151
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Wonderful idea.

152
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,220
I'd love that.

153
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:32,560
All right, let's take a look at three more key phrases on Fluency Builder Part 2.

154
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,740
Fluency Builder So one phrase that we heard from this when

155
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,980
things started to get a little bit more personal, Michelle said, I often like to get together

156
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
with friends.

157
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,760
So this phrase here is to get together with friends.

158
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,300
So to get together means to be united or go with friends somewhere.

159
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
That's right.

160
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,540
So we could also use the phrase to hang out.

161
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,780
This means you're not doing anything in particular.

162
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,140
You're not cooking or swimming or going shopping, but it just means you're together with your

163
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
friends.

164
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
You could be doing anything.

165
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,540
Right, exactly.

166
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,760
So even if you want to ask your friend or colleague, hey, do you want to get together

167
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,860
after work and have a couple of drinks?

168
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,420
All right, that means would you like to hang out or would you like to go somewhere for

169
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
a drink?

170
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,820
It's very informal and it's not romantic.

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
It's just with friends.

172
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Exactly.

173
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,980
So if you ask someone to get together sometime, it doesn't mean let's go out on a date.

174
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,420
It just means let's hang out.

175
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Let's hang out.

176
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Let's be friends.

177
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Okay.

178
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,140
Now, so they were talking about a Brazilian restaurant and James said, hey, we should

179
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,860
go there sometime.

180
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,900
Okay, we should go there together sometime is even more personal.

181
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,820
This is a really common phrase and one that you guys should remember as a phrase.

182
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,980
We should go there sometime.

183
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,980
That means that I would like to make plans with you to go to this restaurant.

184
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Right, exactly.

185
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,460
Now, if you notice the word sometime is separated.

186
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,020
You have some and then apart, the other word is time.

187
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,280
So it's very different from sometimes.

188
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Don't confuse it.

189
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,700
What we're saying here is when you have time, when I have time, we should go there.

190
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,660
It's almost like saying one time or in the future.

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
Sometimes is different.

192
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,500
It's like I brush my teeth sometimes.

193
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,260
That means that, not very often.

194
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,940
No, that's not true.

195
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,340
But I would like to go there sometime means, you know, it's a little bit vague.

196
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,900
I don't say when, but I would like to in the future.

197
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Exactly.

198
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
And Michelle agrees.

199
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
She says, well, it's a wonderful idea.

200
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,980
I'd love that.

201
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Okay.

202
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,380
This is another great phrase.

203
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,700
Remember this as a phrase.

204
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,060
Would you like to go see a movie?

205
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,060
I'd love that.

206
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
I'd love that.

207
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
So I'd love that.

208
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
I'd love to.

209
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,260
These are ways of saying I like the idea.

210
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Let's do it.

211
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Exactly.

212
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,940
So it's usually in response to an invitation or suggestion.

213
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Very good.

214
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
All right.

215
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,700
So let's take a look at our dialogue again and review everything and we'll be back in

216
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,100
a bit.

217
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,100
So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

218
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,540
She's my colleague from Brazil.

219
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,260
Maria, this is Michelle.

220
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,380
Hi Michelle.

221
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,420
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

222
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,620
I mean, what work do you do?

223
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,000
I work in advertising right now.

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,060
How about you?

225
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,780
I'm actually in the wine business.

226
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,540
Oh, that sounds really great.

227
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,620
I love wine myself.

228
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,860
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

229
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,180
No, actually, I often visit.

230
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,820
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

231
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Also I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

232
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,980
So that's a good reason to come.

233
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Me too.

234
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,460
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

235
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,940
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

236
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,700
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

237
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,740
We should go there together sometime.

238
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
Wonderful idea.

239
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,380
I'd love that.

240
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,100
All right.

241
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,780
So as we can see, it's very quick, small conversation, but very good phrases to talk to a stranger,

242
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,900
to start up a small conversation.

243
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,260
I think these are great too, Marco, because if you're learning English and you want to

244
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,260
practice your speaking skills, you're not going to have many people to talk about deep

245
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
things with.

246
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,740
So it's great to use with strangers or with people in your office.

247
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
That's right.

248
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,540
And these are common, typical questions.

249
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,740
And they're also appropriate to ask someone.

250
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,140
So obviously, if you meet someone new, you're not going to ask them how much money they

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,820
make because that's kind of inappropriate in Western culture.

252
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
That's right.

253
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,220
So what we've taught you here are very polite, very common phrases.

254
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,720
We hope, hope, hope that you'll go out and practice these.

255
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,060
If you have questions or comments, don't hesitate to leave them for us.

256
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,380
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

257
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,380
All right.

258
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,380
We'll see you guys there.

259
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,380
Bye.

260
00:10:49,380 --> 00:11:11,880
¡chao!
