00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,080
And my name is Kathryn and today we have a great lesson for you about traveling.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
That's right.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,200
You know, we have taken a look at previous lessons where you can buy a ticket, how to

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,980
book a flight, what to do at the airport, but now we are going to see what we can do

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,200
if our flight gets canceled.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,680
Okay, this is not a fun situation, but hopefully with our help you'll be able to understand

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,840
what these messages are about flights that are canceled or delayed.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,560
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,440
Good afternoon, sir.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,880
May I please see your passport and reservation?

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,640
Here you go.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,120
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,120
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Canceled?

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,100
What am I supposed to do now?

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,480
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,840
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,980
evening, but it's on a first come, first serve basis.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,600
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,080
What are my other options?

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,320
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,920
take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
That's fine.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
I'll do that then.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,160
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,040
I'll book your flight now.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
All right, we're back.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,560
So now it's time for us to go into Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,920
All right, in Language Takeaway today, we have about four words or phrases.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,300
The first one is the reason for this cancellation.

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,520
The reason is mechanical problems.

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
That's right.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,760
She said that the airplane has some mechanical problems and that's why the flight is canceled.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,840
So the key here is mechanical.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,600
Mechanical meaning like related to machines, right?

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,280
All right, so something that's a mechanical problem has to do with the actual structure

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
of the plane.

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
That's right.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,640
So for example, maybe something is wrong with the wings or maybe something is wrong with

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,680
the engines, some type of problem that has to do with the mechanics of the machine.

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Right.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,840
And obviously, if you have a problem with the wings or the wheels or the engine, you

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,880
don't want to fly that plane.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
That's right.

48
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,560
So this caused the canceled flight.

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,400
Now after that, we heard this word, we apologize for any inconveniences.

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
What's an inconvenience, Marco?

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
That's right.

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,440
Well, obviously, I planned to take this flight, let's say Tuesday at 8 a.m. and if the flight

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,200
is canceled, that means I have to wait an hour or three hours or maybe for the next

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
day.

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
So it's an inconvenience.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,060
It means it's not convenient for me.

57
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,560
It causes me some trouble.

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,840
All right, so something that is inconvenient causes problems or causes trouble.

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
That's right.

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,720
So for example, you have this late flight or canceled flight, that's an inconvenience.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,800
But also, small things can be inconvenient as well.

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,160
Like I want to go home at 5.

63
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,400
Unfortunately, I have to write this report.

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,060
It's very inconvenient.

65
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,060
That's right.

66
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,720
So maybe you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 12, but you also have a meeting at your

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,400
work so it's inconvenient, these two dates.

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,240
All right, they cause problems for each other.

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,480
So after that, the service person says if your flight is urgent, I can put you on a

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
waiting list.

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Right.

72
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
Waiting list.

73
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,000
So this is another important phrase to understand when we're talking about canceled flights.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,520
We usually get put on a waiting list and it's basically a list with everyone's names where

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,880
you are waiting for the next available flight or you're waiting to be able to have the service

77
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
provided.

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,840
All right, so you can have a waiting list at an airport like here, but you can also

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,940
have a waiting list at a restaurant, right?

80
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
That's right.

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,640
Restaurants are super popular and you got to get on a waiting list.

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
So can I put my name on the waiting list?

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,000
That means can you call me when there's a free table?

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Right, exactly.

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,800
So even though we are on this waiting list, it doesn't mean that we are guaranteed to

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
be able to take this flight this evening.

87
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
So there is no guarantee.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,280
All right, this guarantee, this is an important thing to talk about because a guarantee is

89
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,080
something that means that we will definitely get a later flight.

90
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Yeah, we promise.

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
We promise.

92
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,400
So you often see the word guarantee in advertisements.

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,760
For example, this TV has a six month guarantee.

94
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
So we guarantee it won't break.

95
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,200
If it does, we will fix it.

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,560
But no guarantee means that we can't promise.

97
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
We don't promise.

98
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
So it's possible that you won't get a flight.

99
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,380
So for example, if you buy a new car, the manufacturer will guarantee that it's in good

100
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,080
condition and it won't break down.

101
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,960
But if you buy a used car, it's unlikely that they will give you that same guarantee.

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
No, that's right.

103
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,840
They cannot promise it because they don't know.

104
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Exactly.

105
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,640
All right, so a lot of words and phrases there.

106
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:02,800
Why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue again.

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,160
May I please see your passport and reservation?

109
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
Here you go.

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,260
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

111
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,400
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Canceled?

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
What am I supposed to do now?

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,640
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,520
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this

116
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,680
evening.

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,120
But it's on a first come first serve basis.

118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,760
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

119
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,240
What are my other options?

120
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,200
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today.

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,080
And you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

122
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
That's fine.

123
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I'll do that then.

124
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,280
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

125
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,160
I'll book your flight now.

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,560
All right, so now let's take a look at three key phrases that we have prepared for you

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
on Fluency Builder.

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Fluency Builder.

129
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,500
Okay, so the first phrase we have here is a very important one.

130
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,920
This tells us about the cause of the problem.

131
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,920
The service person said, I'm sorry, sir.

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,200
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

133
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Right.

134
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,160
So this phrase due to basically is saying because of, right?

135
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
That's right.

136
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,320
So this flight has been canceled because of mechanical problems.

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,440
And remember this due is D-U-E.

138
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
That's right.

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
D-U-E.

140
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,160
So I think it's kind of a nicer or more formal way of saying because of or the reason is.

141
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Exactly.

142
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,520
So for example, the picnic has been canceled due to bad weather.

143
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,160
So it sounds a lot more professional, a lot more formal than if you say because of bad

144
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
weather.

145
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
All right.

146
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,320
So just remember here due to indicates the cause or the reason.

147
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
It's like saying because.

148
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
All right.

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,960
Now, when we were talking about the flights, we said that we are on the waiting list, but

150
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,120
in order to catch this flight, they are going to take people on a first come first served

151
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
basis.

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
All right.

153
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,280
First come first served.

154
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Now, this is again a very common phrase.

155
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,780
It's related to that waiting list thing we were talking about.

156
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,440
If you have a waiting list, usually the waiting list is first come first serve.

157
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,080
So I could say, am I guaranteed a spot?

158
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,440
And you could say, well.

159
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,800
It's first come first serve.

160
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Maybe, maybe not.

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Right.

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,120
If I'm number one on the list, I will probably get a seat.

163
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,560
But if I'm number 30, probably not.

164
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,340
So what we mean by it is that we don't give priority to anyone.

165
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,080
We don't say, oh, you are more important or you're not.

166
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Whoever comes first gets it.

167
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
All right.

168
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,840
So if I come to the restaurant at five o'clock, I get to sit first.

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
But if you come at 510, you're next.

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
And after you, 530.

171
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,080
So it's first come first serve.

172
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,480
It depends on when you arrive.

173
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
That's right.

174
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,560
So obviously this wasn't convenient for us.

175
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,400
So we are going to wait until tomorrow.

176
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,320
But the airline will put us up in a hotel.

177
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,160
We will put you up in a hotel.

178
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
All right.

179
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,320
So let's take this as a phrase because we all know what a hotel is.

180
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,420
It's a place where you stay when you're on holiday or business.

181
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,400
But to put someone up, what exactly does this mean?

182
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,480
Basically you are paying for that person to stay at that hotel.

183
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,760
And you made the reservation and you're going to pay for the room.

184
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,360
So I will put you up means I will pay for your room at a hotel.

185
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Right.

186
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,760
And it's usually only for accommodation for a hotel.

187
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,800
You can't say I will put you up for a meal.

188
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
No.

189
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,660
But you can say I'll put you up at my house, which means I will let you stay the night

190
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
at my house.

191
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,560
So not food, but actually sleeping.

192
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Right.

193
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
So it usually involves sleeping.

194
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
That's right.

195
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,440
So for example, you could say he's coming to our hometown for the wedding.

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,640
I will put him up at my house.

197
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Right.

198
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,880
Or if your company sent you to Japan, you say my company put me up at the Hyatt Hotel.

199
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Oh, fancy.

200
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Nice.

201
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
All right.

202
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
So that's all the phrases we have for you.

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

204
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,000
Good afternoon, sir.

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,240
May I please see your passport and reservation?

206
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,880
Here you go.

207
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

208
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

209
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Canceled?

210
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,320
What am I supposed to do now?

211
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,720
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

212
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,600
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this

213
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
evening.

214
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,220
But it's on a first come, first serve basis.

215
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,840
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

216
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
What are my other options?

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today.

218
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,200
And you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

219
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
That's fine.

220
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I'll do that then.

221
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

222
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,160
I'll book your flight now.

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,840
All right.

224
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,560
We're back.

225
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,240
So talking about canceled flights, usually it's due to bad weather.

226
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
And usually you can catch another flight soon.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
But sometimes you do have these problems.

228
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,600
Like when there was the whole 9-11 thing, I think a lot of flights were canceled or

229
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,520
the volcano that erupted and European flights were grounded for a long time.

230
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes, that's right.

231
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
So sometimes there are natural disasters.

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Sometimes there are man-made disasters.

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
But you actually said a very interesting word there and something that I think people who

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,320
are learning about this should definitely study.

235
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
The word is grounded.

236
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
A flight has been grounded.

237
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Yes.

238
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,600
That means that the airplane will stay on the ground.

239
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,280
It means the plane will not fly.

240
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
OK.

241
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,600
So when planes are grounded because of bad weather or because of a natural disaster like

242
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,960
a volcano, it's a very serious situation because the people who are going to fly can't now.

243
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,600
Now in our dialogue, we saw that they handled it, the airline handled it very, very well.

244
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
But I think this is a very rare case.

245
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
You've had flights canceled before.

246
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
How did they handle it?

247
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I have.

248
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,840
I've had two or three flights canceled one time because of a blizzard.

249
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,160
So all flights were grounded.

250
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,760
The weather was very bad, very dangerous.

251
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,040
And the airline company said, well, we're sorry.

252
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,680
There are no more flights.

253
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,240
But if you come back tomorrow, we can help you.

254
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,680
And I was very lucky because they did not give me a hotel.

255
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,560
They did not put me up in a hotel.

256
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
But I was staying with a friend.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
So my friends put me up at her house.

258
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,840
But the other time the flight was canceled, the airline put me on a flight from another

259
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,520
company, another airline company.

260
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,600
And so sometimes they can do that where they have a relationship with another airline company,

261
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
they can do that.

262
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,240
So usually they do try to handle it relatively well.

263
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,080
But I've heard sometimes that they are not very understanding or very sympathetic to

264
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,640
the inconvenience they cause.

265
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Definitely.

266
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,480
And I think the worst is when it's bad weather because everyone's angry.

267
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,840
And all the customers need to go somewhere, but they can't because there are no flights.

268
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,160
And so the people who are working for the airlines get very frustrated or upset.

269
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Right.

270
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,800
Because basically it's not their fault.

271
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
It's not their fault.

272
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
There's bad weather.

273
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,560
So there's not really much compensation the company can give you.

274
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
No, definitely not.

275
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Not really their fault.

276
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,320
But it's hard not to get frustrated because you want to go home, you're tired, you don't

277
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,400
want to pay for another night in a hotel.

278
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
So I can understand both sides.

279
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Right.

280
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,720
Well, it's an interesting topic and I'm sure many of our listeners who have traveled have

281
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
had a flight delayed or canceled.

282
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,800
So you can come to our website and share your story with us.

283
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,200
And of course, if you have any questions or comments.

You can find us at EnglishPod.com.

285
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
We hope to see you all there.

286
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
All right.

287
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Bye.

288
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Bye.
