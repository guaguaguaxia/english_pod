00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,800
My name is Marto.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,960
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,360
And today we're talking about something very, very important in the computer age.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Internet.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,480
Internet and internet connections.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Right.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,120
I think, well, so many people use the internet now and have it, but it's sometimes a little

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,200
bit complicated to maybe get a plan or maybe if you're not too familiar with the terms,

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,680
that's what we're going to be looking at today.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,600
So listen out for some of these words today.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,720
We're talking on the phone with someone who's going to help us get a plan.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,480
When we come back, we'll be talking all about what some of these words and phrases mean.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,360
So if you're confused, just wait a couple seconds and we'll be back.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,520
Welcome to Gallinet.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
How can I help you?

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hi, I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,120
Of course.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,840
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,880
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,680
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,840
I have no idea what kbps means.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,480
I just want to be able to get online, play games and chat with my friends.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,840
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,600
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,440
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,040
of 2 megabytes.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,160
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,840
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,720
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,480
You're saving yourself $100 right there.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
And we'll throw in this pen drive.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Awesome!

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,280
All right, so interesting.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,680
A lot of these are technical terms specifically for internet and computers and connection

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
and all that stuff.

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,320
Yeah, and the nice thing about some of these words is that they can be used in other ways

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
as well.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,680
So, we're learning about these and expanding our vocabularies, but they're useful in many

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,320
other contexts as well.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, so let's get started with these words now in Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,220
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,640
So this first phrase, for example, is something that you see advertised all the time and it's

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
a kind of internet connection.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Broadband internet.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,920
Okay, so internet is pretty clear, but broadband, you might be asking, what the heck can this

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
mean?

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
Okay, so you have broad.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,480
So broad means wide.

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,000
And a band is basically a frequency at which something works.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Like bandwidth.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
Bandwidth, uh-huh.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,320
So you have broadband, you have fast or high speed internet.

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,480
That means the bigger the space is, the more information can be transferred.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,680
So it's a fast connection essentially.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Exactly.

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,120
Before broadband, we had dial-up internet.

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Ooh.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah.

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Remember AOL?

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Yeah, exactly.

65
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
It was so slow.

66
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
So you had to use your modem and call a number and then get connected by telephone.

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,360
So it was a dial-up connection, but it was so slow.

68
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,960
And every time it broke, the connection would break.

69
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,360
You had to dial-up again and go through the whole process.

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
It was so annoying.

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Exactly.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,120
So fortunately now, not many people use dial-up anymore and we have broadband internet.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,400
Now if you have broadband internet, it's really convenient because you can download any type

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,120
of application or music, videos, et cetera.

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Right.

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,760
So this is another key computer word that actually has a couple of different uses.

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,160
For example, as you said, you can download music or download photos.

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,040
That means you find a photo on the internet that you like and you could save it on your

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
computer.

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
But you can also have a download.

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
So it can be a thing too.

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Okay.

83
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,600
So if maybe you're downloading three different files, you have three downloads.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Okay.

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,320
So to download and download.

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Very good.

87
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,200
So now with internet, you have different speeds as we talked about, right?

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,880
How fast you're downloading something.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,000
And the guy mentioned 512 kbps.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,320
Oh no.

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,560
Not another one of these kbps.

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,800
So this one, actually this was pretty simple.

93
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,280
You can think about kilobytes.

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
You've heard about megabytes, kilobytes.

95
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,520
This is a size.

96
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,280
How fast you can receive these packets of information.

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,040
So 512 kilobytes per second.

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,080
Per second, that's, I have no idea how much that is.

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
It's maybe a lot.

100
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
It sounds like a lot.

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Right.

102
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,240
Well, basically it is a lot, but we saw later that he was asking for a connection speed

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
of two megabytes.

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,560
Oh, so mega is bigger than kpbs, right?

105
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Right.

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
All right.

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
So these are different speeds of transferring information, right?

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,440
So this is a way for you to see what kind of internet plan you want.

109
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Exactly.

110
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,040
And so we have kilobytes, we have megabytes, and basically you want a faster connection

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,640
speed because you want to avoid lag.

112
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
Ooh, lag.

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
All right.

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,200
This is a word that you can use in a lot of different ways.

115
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,040
For example, my brother always lags behind.

116
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Okay.

117
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,800
So it's a verb, but in this case we're talking about the noun.

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,280
So lag is slowness.

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah.

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
It's like a delay.

121
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Yeah.

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,480
It's a delay in something.

123
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,520
So in this case, I can't even play my video games because there's too much lag.

124
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
So that means the internet's too slow.

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Too slow.

126
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Exactly.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,900
So that's what happens when you have a slow connection speed, you have lag.

128
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,480
And as you can say, it refers to something that's slow or delayed.

129
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,760
So you can use it in other contexts when you want to say something is a little bit slow.

130
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,160
Well and another key thing here as we're talking about internet connections is the router.

131
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,880
So router is something that helps us to route an internet connection.

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
So for example.

133
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,520
So it basically distributes the internet connection to different computers or to different users.

134
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,320
And some of these you plug in and some of them are wireless.

135
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,760
That means without a wire.

136
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,240
So a wireless router is something, a little box in your house that allows you to maybe

137
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,800
have three or four computers on one broadband connection.

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Right.

139
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
So it's very popular now.

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,360
You go to Starbucks and you have Wi-Fi.

141
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,920
In order to have Wi-Fi or wireless internet, you need a router, a wireless router.

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Okay.

143
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
So wireless router.

144
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,360
And finally, what is something that might get in the way of a connection?

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,000
You have a firewall.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,920
Very important security measure when navigating the internet.

147
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
All right.

148
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,560
So personal firewall is a firewall that you have on your computer to keep people from

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
spying on you.

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,420
This keeps other people out.

151
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
So it's exactly that.

152
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,520
It's a wall between your computer and the outside world.

153
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,960
So it protects you from any type of maybe malicious intruders.

154
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Right.

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,120
And oftentimes governments and public offices, things like that, law offices, they have firewalls

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
to protect the information that they store because it's so important that it's secretive.

157
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Yeah.

158
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
So firewalls.

159
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,960
There are many different types of firewalls, but a personal firewall is just a basic one.

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Great.

161
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,320
So that is our language takeaway for today.

162
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:23,600
Let's check out this dialogue again and slow it down a bit this time.

163
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
Welcome to Gallinet.

164
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
How can I help you?

165
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Hi.

166
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,400
I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,560
Of course.

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,280
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

169
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,280
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,080
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

171
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,240
I have no idea what kbps means.

172
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,880
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

173
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,280
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

174
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,960
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

175
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,880
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed

176
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
of 2 megabytes.

177
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,600
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,240
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

179
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,520
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

180
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

181
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,320
You're saving yourself $100 right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

182
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Awesome.

183
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,920
All right, great.

184
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,480
So we just heard all these words that we looked at before, but now why don't we take a look

185
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,840
at some of these phrases in Fluency Builder.

186
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,000
What's this first one?

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
I can't read it.

189
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,520
I have no idea.

190
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
What?

191
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,280
Well, didn't you write it down?

192
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,480
I have no idea what you're talking about.

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
All right.

194
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Enough games.

195
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
No.

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I have no idea.

197
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,520
Well, it's going to treat this as a phrase that gets said as is.

198
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,040
We're not going to take bits and pieces of it.

199
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,600
So I have no idea, or he has no idea, is a way to say, listen.

200
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I don't know.

201
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I don't know.

202
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I really don't know.

203
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Right.

204
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,200
The guy was talking about KBPS and all these things, and the other guy was like, I have

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
no idea what you're talking about.

206
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,080
I don't understand.

207
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,960
And I can definitely empathize.

208
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
You can relate.

209
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Yeah.

210
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,920
Well, we'll leave that for another one.

211
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,600
But after this, we've got bucks.

212
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
So bucks.

213
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Is this slang?

214
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Bucks.

215
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
A hundred bucks.

216
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Two hundred bucks.

217
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
A lot of money.

218
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Right.

219
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,760
So bucks is basically another way of saying dollars.

220
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
All right.

221
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
So this is a way for...

222
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,120
Well, this is a way that most Americans talk about money.

223
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,400
It's one buck is one US dollar.

224
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
All right.

225
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,720
So can I borrow 10 bucks, Marco?

226
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Right.

227
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah, sure.

228
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
There you go.

229
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,480
Now, bucks, you can only use it for American currency, right?

230
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,000
You can't use it for like euros or...

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
I mean, I wouldn't say like 10 euros would be 10 bucks.

233
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
No, no, no, no.

234
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,320
Usually, you say this about American dollars and you say this just when you're hanging

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,880
out or how much does this cost?

236
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Oh, five bucks.

237
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Yeah.

238
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Very good.

239
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
So the guy was telling him about the price of the internet and everything.

240
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,240
And he said that he's going to throw in a pen drive, right?

241
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
He's going to throw it?

242
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
He's going to throw it at him.

243
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,560
No, he's going to throw in a pen drive for free.

244
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,640
Oh, sweet.

245
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,000
So throw in means to add.

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Or include.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Include.

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
So, listen.

249
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,560
Sir, here's your large popcorn and I'm going to throw in a small diet Coke for free.

250
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Wow.

251
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,360
How generous of me.

252
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,320
So you throw in something, you include it for free, right?

253
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Exactly.

254
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,400
So this is usually a complimentary item.

255
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Great.

256
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,640
I think this word is really interesting or this phrase.

257
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,080
So why don't we listen to a couple of other examples using throw in.

258
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,040
Example one.

259
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,520
If you buy two pizzas, we will throw in another one for free.

260
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Example two.

261
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,720
Tell you what.

262
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,560
I'll buy this computer if you throw in a pair of headphones.

263
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,720
Deal?

264
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,960
Example three.

265
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,000
The salesman threw in a subscription to the local newspaper for buying his product.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,440
Isn't that great?

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
All right.

268
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Great.

269
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
So good examples.

270
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,560
I think it's clear now.

271
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,840
The phrases, all these words related to the internet.

272
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Absolutely.

273
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
And so useful.

274
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Right.

275
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,120
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and

276
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,080
talk a little bit more.

277
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,420
Welcome to Gallinet.

278
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,680
How can I help you?

279
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Hi.

280
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,960
I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

281
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,000
Of course.

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,720
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

283
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,720
The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

284
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,520
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 kbps.

285
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,680
I have no idea what kbps means.

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,320
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

287
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

288
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,440
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,280
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed

290
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,880
of 2 megabytes.

291
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,000
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

292
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,680
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

293
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,520
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

294
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,560
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

295
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,320
You are saving yourself $100 right there.

296
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,320
And we'll throw in this pen drive.

297
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,040
Awesome!

298
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,560
So the internet is a big deal nowadays and now you can do so much on it.

299
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,720
Not only navigate websites anymore, but watch movies, download applications, photos, Facebook,

300
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
all this type of things now you can do on the internet.

301
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,280
You can even do it from your phone, like when you're in the bathroom or on the train.

302
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,120
I mean, it's scary.

303
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,600
We're always connected.

304
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Right.

305
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
So it's interesting.

306
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
You're always connected.

307
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,280
You're always online with people.

308
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,920
And it's actually very noticeable when you maybe live somewhere else.

309
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,640
Before you used to have to write letters.

310
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,760
I don't think many people receive handwritten letters anymore.

311
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Never.

312
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I'm speaking for myself.

313
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
I never receive.

314
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,280
And I don't write them either.

315
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,120
So I guess I'm guilty of it.

316
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,000
So now people just send emails.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,080
Obviously it's more convenient, but maybe it's a little bit less significant maybe than

318
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,040
actually going to the post office or taking the time to write a letter, going to the post

319
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
office and stuff.

320
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Well, I don't know.

321
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,000
I mean, there's something nice about having a physical thing you can hold on to, but I

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
wonder if one day we're going to forget how to write.

323
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
You know, like write with a pen.

324
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
With a pen and pencil.

325
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Exactly.

326
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,120
We're going to have these little PDAs and these little iPhones and they're going to

327
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
just, you're going to talk and they're going to take everything down in note form for you.

328
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,520
Well, now it's kind of happening with the Kindle, right?

329
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,000
Now you can have books on this electronic device that lets you read through them.

330
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,720
You can carry a hundred books with you to the beach.

331
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,320
So now you don't even really need physical books, which is good on some level because

332
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,160
you know, you're saving trees and space and all that stuff.

333
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,440
But there's something physical about reading a book.

334
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,600
You hold it, you flip the pages, you know how many pages you have left.

335
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I don't know.

336
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
We'll see.

337
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Maybe I'll be a convert one day, but for now I'm good with paper books.

338
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
All right.

339
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,280
So what do you guys think about the internet, about electronic books?

340
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,960
You can also tell us any problems or confusion you have with the things that we talked about

341
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
today.

342
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,640
Hopefully everything is clear, but if not, we are here to answer your questions.

343
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
We like to do so.

344
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,280
So check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

345
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
All right.

346
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,160
We'll see you guys there and until next time.

347
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Goodbye everyone.
