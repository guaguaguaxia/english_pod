00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,840
My name is Katherine and today we have a very weather focused lesson.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,200
It's all about all the horrible things that can happen to you with the weather.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
Exactly.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,960
So as you know, there are many different types of weather and not only rain or sunshine but

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,480
many other phenomena.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,420
So we're going to take a look at some of those but before we go into it, let's take a look

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,000
at one word on Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,320
Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,080
Okay, so we're talking about extreme weather today.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,480
That's not rain or drizzle or sunshine.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,720
We're talking about really interesting, unique and sometimes devastating things that can

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
happen.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,920
So today's vocabulary word is Armageddon.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
Alright, so Armageddon.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
Now you've probably seen the movie Armageddon.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,680
So what does this word mean?

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,900
Okay, so this word is a reference to the end of the world.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,220
It means the time when the world will end because of a great catastrophe or a great

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,220
disaster.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,340
Okay, so everyone talks about Armageddon.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,660
It's mentioned in the Bible and as you say, it's when the world stops existing.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,660
Exactly.

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,140
So think about that one as we listen to today's dialogue.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:36,180
We will be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,900
Those are the headlines for today and now for the International Weather Report with

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Mike Sanderson.

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,780
Thank you, Bob.

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,180
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many as a series of unprecedented meteorological

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,260
events occurred around the world.

32
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,020
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

33
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,180
Fortunately, no one was injured.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,900
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S. Midwest, causing classes

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,620
in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,020
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,500
farming but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,840
electricity for the entire country.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,300
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,300
region.

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,580
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,660
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

43
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,420
Not a great week for the world.

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Any good news?

45
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
I'm afraid not, Bob.

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,900
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,900
region.

48
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,980
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana and officials say that

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,820
all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America, affecting

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,540
Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama.

51
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,500
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Back to you, Bob.

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:04,860
All right, we're back.

54
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,500
And well, this weather report is not really far from the truth.

55
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,180
I mean, this kind of stuff happens every day all over the world, right?

56
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,180
That's correct.

57
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,940
And unfortunately, it's been happening very frequently in the past couple months.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,340
We've heard of a lot of earthquakes and volcanoes and things like that.

59
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,180
So this is very valuable stuff when you're trying to talk about current events as well.

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Okay.

61
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,580
So why don't we start now analyzing a couple of different words and phrases on Language

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,580
Takeaway.

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Language Takeaway.

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Well, the first vocabulary item we have here is meteorological event.

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,420
It's a real mouthful.

66
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,340
It's a long word.

67
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Meteorological.

68
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,220
So for example, meteorological means having to do with the weather, something that's related

69
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,660
to the weather.

70
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,380
So a meteorological event could be rain, snow.

71
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,420
Okay.

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,940
So it has to do with meteorology.

73
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,340
Meteorology is the study of the weather.

74
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,460
And someone who does this is a meteorologist.

75
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,780
So usually the weathermen that you see on TV, they're meteorologists.

76
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,740
So let's go now to Marco, our resident meteorologist.

77
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
There we go.

78
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,140
Our resident meteorologist.

79
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,140
Right.

80
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
Okay.

81
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,460
So meteorological events.

82
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,340
Now moving on, one of the first events that we're going to look at is an avalanche.

83
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,820
Avalanche.

84
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,220
And avalanche has to do with snow.

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,260
This means that when a mountain that has a lot of snow on it, maybe part of that snow

86
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,340
breaks off and starts to roll down, you have a wall of snow that comes down.

87
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,620
That's an avalanche.

88
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,620
That's an avalanche.

89
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,300
So you could say, avalanche.

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
When the snow comes down.

91
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,700
And it's actually very dangerous because people can get buried under the snow.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
Yeah, exactly.

93
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
All right.

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Another event that has to do with snow is a blizzard.

95
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Okay.

96
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,980
A blizzard is different from an avalanche because an avalanche, maybe it's not snowing.

97
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,900
The snow just falls.

98
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,320
But in a blizzard, you're talking about a storm of snow.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,220
But it's like a lot of snow coming down from the sky.

100
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,940
So much snow that you probably can't see anything.

101
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,500
There's just white everywhere.

102
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Okay.

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
All right.

104
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
So that's a blizzard.

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,620
A lot of, lot of snow coming down from the sky.

106
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,140
Now moving on, the opposite of snow and things being wet is we have a drought.

107
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,300
Yeah, this is the opposite of wet actually.

108
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,740
So there's no rain in a drought.

109
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,980
A drought means that things are very dry.

110
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,500
The land is very dry.

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Okay.

112
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,540
So it's a period of time that there's no snow, there's no water, there's no rain, there's

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
nothing.

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
It's very, very dry.

115
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
We're going through a drought.

116
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
Correct.

117
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,700
And the reason the problem with a drought is very dangerous is because people cannot

118
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,500
grow food in a drought.

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,220
And so lots of people starve when this happens.

120
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
Okay.

121
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,220
So you got to watch out for a drought.

122
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:11,540
Now, in this case, it not only affected farming, but also we have a hydroelectric power plant

123
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
that can't work, obviously, because there's no water.

124
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,540
So hydro means water.

125
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,060
Hydroelectric means electricity that is generated by flowing water.

126
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,900
Well, a mill, something that turns water on a river is a way to get power from water.

127
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,460
But a hydroelectric project that can give you electricity is maybe like a dam or an

128
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
electric mill.

129
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
Right.

130
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,020
So usually you have these on rivers and they just take advantage of the flowing of water

131
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,340
to turn some huge turbines and generate power.

132
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,140
So that's all we have for now.

133
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,580
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

134
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:57,060
And we'll be back shortly to take a look at some more words.

135
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,740
Those are the headlines for today.

136
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,380
And now for the International Weather Report with Mike Sanderson.

137
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
Thank you, Bob.

138
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,780
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many as a series of unprecedented meteorological

139
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,860
events occurred around the world.

140
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,620
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

141
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,780
Fortunately, no one was injured.

142
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,500
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S. Midwest, causing classes

143
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,020
in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

144
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,620
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected

145
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,100
farming but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides

146
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,440
electricity for the entire country.

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,940
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern

148
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
region.

149
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,780
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

150
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,900
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

151
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,700
Not a great week for the world.

152
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Any good news?

153
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,460
I'm afraid not, Bob.

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,980
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the

155
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
region.

156
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,020
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that

157
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,860
all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America, affecting

158
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,580
Honduras, Guatemala and Panama.

159
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,580
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the 6 o'clock news.

160
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,940
Back to you, Bob.

161
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:25,020
Well, a word that many people are unfortunately familiar with is Richter or Richter scale.

162
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,300
And now this is something that a lot of people are talking about right now because of the

163
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,580
earthquake in Sichuan, China last year and the earthquake in Haiti very recently.

164
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,820
And so the Richter scale, that's a big R because it's a proper name, is a way for us to determine

165
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,460
how severe, how big the earthquake was.

166
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Right.

167
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,220
So people talk about a 6.0, a 7.1.

168
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,580
So that's on the Richter scale.

169
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,020
The lowest is zero and the highest is 10, correct?

170
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Right.

171
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,700
But 10 is like impossible, apparently.

172
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Apparently.

173
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,660
And a lot of them are actually underwater, but the very serious ones are maybe 8.0, 7.0.

174
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,260
All right.

175
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,780
So Richter scale.

176
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,500
Now we talked about earthquakes.

177
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,220
We talked about snowing.

178
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,300
Now let's talk about a volcano.

179
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,980
A volcano in Mexico has erupted.

180
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,060
Okay.

181
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,220
So we've got two words here, volcano.

182
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,700
A volcano is a mountain that has an opening in the center where lava from the middle of

183
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,100
the earth, the center of the earth, can come out.

184
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,340
So it's very dangerous, obviously, because it's very hot.

185
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,260
But a volcano doesn't open.

186
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,500
It erupts.

187
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,020
So the verb here that we use with a volcano is to erupt.

188
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,180
Okay, so it doesn't explode, a volcano erupts.

189
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,020
That means to open violently, very quickly.

190
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Okay.

191
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,260
So when this happens, obviously you have a lot of lava, you have maybe snow that melts,

192
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,020
and you have floods and landslides.

193
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,460
Okay, landslides.

194
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,020
A landslide is one word, but it's made up of two words that you probably already know.

195
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,080
So land, obviously it's the ground and things like that, the earth.

196
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,780
But a slide is to move down across the ground.

197
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,220
And so a landslide happens when you've got something like lava or water that's pushing

198
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,900
all of the earth, all of the ground down.

199
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,180
And it's destroying houses and trees and land, and it's very, very destructive.

200
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
Right.

201
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,060
So you usually see this that happens on the side of mountains, on the side of hills, where

202
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,860
all that land starts to slide down or to go down.

203
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,540
And it's very similar to an avalanche, right?

204
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,220
But instead of snow falling down, it's land.

205
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Mud and land.

206
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Mud, yeah.

207
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
All right.

208
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,500
So we have a landslide.

209
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,500
And because of all the eruptions and the earthquakes, they said that they have a lot of seismic activity.

210
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,060
This word seismic is something that I've heard a lot recently in movies, like 2012.

211
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,860
So seismic means having to do with the movement of the plates under the earth's crust.

212
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,100
So the earth is not everything that we see.

213
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,900
It's also activity, things happening underneath the ground.

214
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,100
And so underneath the ground, we have these big plates.

215
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,820
And seismic activity is what happens when these kind of things start to move.

216
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Activity is movement.

217
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,380
And so seismic activity refers to earthquakes and volcanoes, things that are changing under

218
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,100
the ground that will affect us.

219
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
OK.

220
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,220
So that's seismic activity.

221
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,060
It's pronounced seismic, right?

222
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,060
Seismic.

223
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
That's correct.

224
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
Seismic.

225
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,420
And because of all this activity, people say that they may have a tsunami.

226
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,020
Well, this doesn't sound very English, does it?

227
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,180
I know, tsunami.

228
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,500
And actually, if you see the spelling, it's with a T, T-S.

229
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Right.

230
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
I think it's a Japanese word, but I'm not positive.

231
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,940
I think so, too.

232
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,900
Tsunami is the name that we give to a giant tidal wave.

233
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,220
So that's a wave of water in the ocean that's very, very dangerous because it can get to

234
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,180
100, 200 feet tall.

235
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,260
And this means that when it comes down, it can destroy houses, cities, cars, things like

236
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
that.

237
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Right.

238
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,220
And there was a very, very famous tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2004.

239
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
Do you remember that?

240
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,220
Yeah, in Indonesia, right?

241
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,060
That's right, in Indonesia and Thailand and Vietnam.

242
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
Yeah, it was intense.

243
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,060
It was big.

244
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,700
And it was also because of an earthquake, right?

245
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I think so.

246
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,140
All these earthquakes, they move the earth around.

247
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,500
And then all of a sudden, the reaction is that there's water that moves.

248
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,620
And the water then turned into a wave.

249
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,620
Yeah, just imagine what happens if you have a bucket of water and then you start moving

250
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,540
the bucket just a little bit.

251
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,860
You see how water starts to splat all over the place.

252
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
That's right.

253
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,940
All right, so tsunami was our last word for today.

254
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:56,380
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

255
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,080
Those are the headlines for today.

256
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,960
And now for the International Weather Report with Mike Sanderson.

257
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Thank you, Bob.

258
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,360
This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, as a series of unprecedented meteorological

259
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,440
events occurred around the world.

260
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,260
In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps.

261
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,380
Fortunately, no one was injured.

262
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,180
Due to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the U.S. Midwest, causing classes

263
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,660
in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

264
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,220
Moving on to Latin America, Ecuador has suffered a six-month drought that has not only affected

265
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,700
farming but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides

266
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,020
electricity for the entire country.

267
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,500
In Chile, a major earthquake that registered 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the southern

268
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
region.

269
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,780
Losses are reported to be in the billions.

270
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,820
Authorities have not yet released an official statement.

271
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,620
Not a great week for the world.

272
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Any good news?

273
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm afraid not, Bob.

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,100
One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the

275
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
region.

276
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,140
Meanwhile, Mexico's coast has been hit by Hurricane Liliana, and officials say that

277
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,980
all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America, affecting

278
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,700
Honduras, Guatemala and Panama.

279
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,700
That's all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on The 6 O'Clock News.

280
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:25,940
Back to you, Bob.

281
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,860
So Marco, these are all pretty terrifying.

282
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,940
Have you ever experienced a meteorological event like one of the ones that we talked

283
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
about today?

284
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,260
I've actually lived through like three earthquakes, like pretty big ones.

285
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,440
Plus, because you used to live in Los Angeles.

286
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,860
So you get them all the time in LA.

287
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,500
Apart from that, I actually, I've seen a volcano erupt a couple of times because, you know,

288
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,420
Ecuador is a, is, is part of the volcano alley, right?

289
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,820
It's all the Andes mountains and it's part of the circle of fire, what they call.

290
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,220
So we have a couple of different active volcanoes and from time to time they will start to smoke

291
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,620
or to spew some lava, but nothing major.

292
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,940
Like there hasn't been a major catastrophe with the volcanoes.

293
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,260
Hopefully it won't either.

294
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,780
Well, and these days they have a lot of equipment, seismic equipment and meteorological equipment

295
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,420
that can help meteorologists to determine when things will happen, like when a volcano

296
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,740
will erupt or if there will be an earthquake because they can study the tremors in the

297
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
ground.

298
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Right.

299
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Yeah.

300
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,100
And I think probably the most famous volcano is, I think it was in Italy, right?

301
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Mount Vesuvius.

302
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
That's right.

303
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,220
And it was Mount Vesuvius in Naples, which famously destroyed a number of cities in this

304
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,700
ancient civilization and ancient Roman times.

305
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
It was.

306
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,220
And what's amazing is that they still have a lot of the, the buildings underground under

307
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,300
the ash because when all the ash settled, it preserved the bodies like a mummy.

308
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,020
And so you can see the bodies and the things that they, you know, their jewelry and their

309
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
money.

310
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,700
And it's fascinating because it's this horrible, horrible natural disaster actually helped

311
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,380
us in the future learn about this old civilization.

312
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Yeah.

313
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,660
It's crazy.

314
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,260
Actually in Ecuador you can see a huge hole that has like a lake in the middle and you're

315
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,460
like, oh wow, that's beautiful.

316
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,420
But that's actually caused because the entire mountain just kind of blew the top off like

317
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,140
the cone because of this major eruption.

318
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,220
So you can just imagine how powerful these eruptions are.

319
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,820
I can just imagine what it would have been like Mount Vesuvius.

320
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,520
But anyway, on a brighter note, if you have any questions, any comments or any stories

321
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,060
of your own, maybe you've, you've lived through a typhoon, a hurricane or tornado, you can

322
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,620
come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

323
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
We hope to see you there.

324
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
All right.

325
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
Bye guys.

326
00:16:49,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Peace out.
