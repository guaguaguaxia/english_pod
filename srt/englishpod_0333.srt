00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to English Odd.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,480
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about the human body, right Marco?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
That's right.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,400
Today we are going to take a look at very specific vocabulary words related to your

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,000
body, what's inside your body.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,640
So let's just jump right into this dialogue.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:28,240
Let's listen to this anatomy class.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,360
Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,520
Today we will review everything we have learned.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,120
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
The brain.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,240
That's right, the brain.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,520
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,480
system as well as cognition.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,360
Then what major organ is in our chest?

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
The heart.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Very good.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,880
veins.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,000
Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,680
Now what about the organs that help us digest food?

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,700
The stomach and intestines.

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Very good.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,480
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,480
process the food and then expel the waste.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,880
Are we forgetting anything?

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,960
Yeah, our kidneys, liver and bladder.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,680
Oh yes, you are right.

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,520
Very important organs indeed.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,400
So what do these organs do, teacher?

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,920
Well, theyâ€¦

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,040
Time for a break.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,120
We can talk about it when you get back.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,840
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,200
So now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,760
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,760
So the first word we have today is anatomy.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
We've heard this already.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,080
This is the study of the body, right?

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
That's right.

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,040
So maybe in high school you took an anatomy class.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,000
You studied the bodies maybe of animals, for example.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's right.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,520
But if we're talking about human beings, we would call it human anatomy and we would study

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,800
the things like your organs, your bones, all the things that make up your body.

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
That's right.

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,120
And that's our next word.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,840
We're talking about our body organs.

50
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,960
Now this is important.

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Where are these located, Marco?

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Inside or outside?

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Inside.

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
Inside the body.

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,760
So the body has many different organs and we learned all about these in today's dialogue.

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,640
But an organ is basically a part.

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
A part of your body.

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,600
But it has a special function or many functions.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Yeah, that's right.

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,680
So for example, we talked about the heart.

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,120
We all know what the heart is and it's one of our main organs that pumps blood through

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,240
our body.

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
That's right.

64
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,400
And so some of these organs have to do with processing food.

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
Some have to do with blood.

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,800
But there's also an interesting system that we heard about called the central nervous

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
system.

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
That's right.

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
And this is very closely related to the brain.

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,520
So basically the nervous system is in charge of all the things that you feel in your body.

71
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
That's right.

72
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,280
So you feel through what are called nerves and the central nervous system is actually

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,520
a system that connects all these things together and then connects it to the brain.

74
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,720
So think of a system as being comprised of many different parts, not just one nerve.

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
That's right.

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,240
So we're talking about, for example, your skin is part of the nervous system, your eyes,

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
what you see, and all this gets fed into the brain and it processes it.

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,440
And that's what basically the nervous system is all about.

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
That's right.

80
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,760
And the brain is also important for other things.

81
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,840
We heard about this noun cognition.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah.

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,160
The doctor said, yeah, the teacher said that cognition was one of the other things that

84
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
the brain helped us with.

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
So what exactly is cognition?

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,640
Cognition is the ability to think.

87
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
All right.

88
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,320
So humans have cognition.

89
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,800
That means we have brains and our brains allow us to think and even talk and write music

90
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
and things like that.

91
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,480
But for example, a rock does not have cognition.

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,080
A plant would not have cognition either because they don't have this special organ, the brain

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,880
that allows them to think.

94
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Right.

95
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,280
So it's a noun, right?

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,760
You're saying that we have cognition because we have brains.

97
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
That's right.

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
You have it.

99
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Okay.

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,720
So those are the four words that we're going to take a look at to introduce the lesson.

101
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab?

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,020
Let's take a look at some of the main organs that we discussed in this dialogue on Language

103
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,760
Takeaway Part 2.

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,400
Okay, class.

105
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,640
So today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,760
Today we will review everything we have learned.

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,360
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
The brain.

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
That's right.

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
The brain.

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,760
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,720
system as well as cognition.

113
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Then what major organ is in our chest?

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
The heart.

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Very good.

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,080
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and

117
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
veins.

118
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,240
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,920
Now what about the organs that help us digest food?

120
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,960
The stomach and intestines.

121
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Very good.

122
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,680
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,680
process the food and then expel the waste.

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,080
Are we forgetting anything?

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Yeah.

126
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,920
Our kidneys, liver, and bladder.

127
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Oh, yes.

128
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
You are right.

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Very important organs indeed.

130
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,640
So what do these organs do, teacher?

131
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,160
Well, they...

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Time for a break.

133
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
We can talk about it when you get back.

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
So we're moving down the body.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,920
We had the brain and we mentioned the stomach.

136
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,280
We had the brain and then the heart, of course, which pumps blood like you say, Marco.

137
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,480
But the next item, the next organ is the stomach.

138
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
That's right.

139
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,880
So we get to the stomach and the intestines, which are very closely bound together.

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,240
So what does the stomach do first?

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,200
First of all, when you eat food, the food is sent to your stomach where your stomach

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,360
breaks it down and decides what parts to keep and what parts to save, right?

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Right.

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,560
And the interesting thing is that in our stomachs, we have what we call acid.

145
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Yeah.

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,520
So these acids break down those foods because it all gets mixed together in there and your

147
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,800
body has to determine what exactly you've been eating.

148
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Right.

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Exactly.

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,920
So after the stomach breaks things down, it goes through the intestines and also the intestines

151
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,080
are very important and they're very long, but they're all wound up inside our stomach.

152
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
That's right.

153
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,360
And they kind of look like a lot of S's because they're all coiled up inside of us and they're

154
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
indeed quite long.

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,800
But the intestines are also very, very important because they're actually what the waste or

156
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,440
the parts of food that our bodies don't need, so they travel through to get out of our systems.

157
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
That's right.

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,920
So actually the intestines will absorb part of the proteins and the vitamins and everything

159
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
that we need.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,320
And at the same time, they will also act as little tunnels that will transport the waste,

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,360
the things that we don't need to have inside our body to later be able to digest.

162
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
That's right.

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
So the stomach and the intestines, those have to do with the way that we eat, process and

164
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,240
dispose of food.

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,600
But now we have the kidneys.

166
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay.

167
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
So people have two kidneys, right?

168
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,840
Yeah, that's right.

169
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,200
People have two kidneys and actually you can continue living with just one kidney, right?

170
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
That's right.

171
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,600
They're kind of shaped like a C almost.

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,360
In fact, we have something called a kidney bean in English, which is a red bean and it

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
looks just like a kidney.

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Okay.

175
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,920
And well, what do the kidneys do?

176
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,560
The kidneys from what I understand basically clean your blood.

177
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,560
So there's lots of things in your system, in your body, especially from the things that

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,840
you eat and maybe the chemicals that you're exposed to.

179
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,320
And we need our kidneys, or at least the one kidney to clean our blood and to make sure

180
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
our blood is what it's supposed to be.

181
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,760
And in fact, when the kidneys aren't working properly, it's very, very serious and we call

182
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
this kidney failure, right?

183
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,720
So when you're watching a TV show about doctors, maybe you say, oh, he's gone into kidney failure.

184
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Right.

185
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,360
It's a big deal, very big problem.

186
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
All right.

187
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,720
So this is what our kidneys do, a very important part of our bodies, obviously.

188
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,680
And well, as you said, they act as filters, but near the kidneys, we also have the liver.

189
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
That's right.

190
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,320
And the liver is actually for some people, a delicious food, not human liver, but animal

191
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
liver.

192
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,640
But in humans, we also have this organ, right?

193
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,800
And it's also closely related to people who have drinking problems.

194
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
They have bad livers.

195
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,640
And why is that?

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,880
I think it has to do a little bit with what the liver does.

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,200
It does many different things, but alcohol, I think harms your liver, makes it weaker.

198
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,480
And the liver is important because it helps to generate hormones, but it also helps us

199
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,760
process chemicals in our body.

200
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Right.

201
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
So this is really important.

202
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,160
Actually, why the liver is so important is because it does so much.

203
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,080
And well, we only got one of them, so we can't really live without it, right?

204
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
That's right.

205
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,200
So the liver is a very important thing.

206
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,680
And actually, many people now have gone through liver transplants.

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,360
That means that their liver stops working, so they receive the liver of another person.

208
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Right.

209
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah.

210
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,000
So you might hear that as well on TV.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,720
And the last organ that we took a look at here is the bladder, which is also very important,

212
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,000
goes hand in hand with the kidneys.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It does.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It does.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,580
So the bladder, you might hear someone say, I have a bad bladder.

216
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,880
That means that I often have to use the bathroom to go urinate.

217
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,160
Now the bladder is where liquids and also some kinds of chemicals in our bodies that

218
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,760
we get from the food that we eat are kept until we dispose of them.

219
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Right.

220
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Okay.

221
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
All right.

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
So actually when your bladder is full, because it gets full of liquid or urine, that's when

223
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,080
you have to go to the bathroom.

224
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
That's right.

225
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
And so pregnant women often have weaker bladders.

226
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
They feel pressure on the bladder, so it hurts and that doesn't hurt.

227
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
It pushes down the bladder.

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,520
The baby does.

229
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,240
So they often have to pee very often, unlike people who are not pregnant.

230
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Okay.

231
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Very, very interesting.

232
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,520
And actually, some people say that, you know, I have a small bladder and that's why they

233
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,000
go to the bathroom all the time, more often than others.

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,440
Now why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit

235
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,960
to talk a little bit more.

236
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Okay class.

237
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,080
So today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

238
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,240
Today we will review everything we have learned.

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,840
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

240
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
The brain.

241
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
That's right.

242
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
The brain.

243
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,560
The brain is the control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous

244
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,160
system, as well as cognition.

245
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,040
Then what major organ is in our chest?

246
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
The heart.

247
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Very good.

248
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,360
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system, such as blood vessels

249
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
and veins.

250
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,680
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

251
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,360
Now what about the organs that help us digest food?

252
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
The stomach and intestines.

253
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Very good.

254
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,140
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines

255
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,140
process the food and then expel the waste.

256
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,520
Are we forgetting anything?

257
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Yeah.

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,360
Our kidneys, liver and bladder.

259
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Oh yes, you are right.

260
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,160
Very important organs indeed.

261
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,200
So what do these organs do, teacher?

262
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, they...

263
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,740
Time for a break.

264
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,040
We can talk about it when you get back.

265
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,800
All right.

266
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,640
So you mentioned that actually some people get liver transplants.

267
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,560
So out of all these organs, we could also have a kidney transplant, right?

268
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,320
You can donate your kidneys.

269
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
You can.

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
You can.

271
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,040
So obviously you can't have any kidney.

272
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,980
You actually have to have a match, someone who is the right type.

273
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,240
But oftentimes they do perform these surgeries with the kidney transplant or a liver transplant.

274
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
Now what about a heart transplant?

275
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,640
I believe they've done tests of heart transplants and they've done a few successful ones.

276
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,520
Sometimes they use pieces of cow or pig hearts because they have very similar genetic makeups

277
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
to human beings.

278
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,160
So they can use little pieces like valves.

279
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,560
But I really don't know.

280
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't think they're as common as liver or kidney.

281
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
That's right.

282
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,080
And actually these organs, we don't really pay too much attention to them, but they're

283
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:28,800
so very delicate and they do so many things that actually once you only begin having some

284
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,220
problems with them, that's when you realize how important they are.

285
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
That's right.

286
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,800
So it's really important to understand a little bit about how they work and also how to take

287
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
care of them.

288
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,960
Because obviously if you're having liver problems, you should stop drinking so much that there

289
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,220
are some things that you can do to help protect yourself.

290
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,480
And one that we didn't mention is actually the biggest organ that they talk about is

291
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
the skin.

292
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
The skin is a big organ.

293
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,080
Also the lungs we didn't mention.

294
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Yes, the lungs.

295
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,600
The lungs help us breathe.

296
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
But the skin is one of the largest parts of our body.

297
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,080
Yes, I didn't really know that.

298
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
I didn't realize that.

299
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,000
I wasn't very good at anatomy or biology.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,360
I wasn't really into it much.

301
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,200
But I didn't realize that the skin is actually an organ just like the heart, the lungs, everything.

302
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,360
Interesting.

303
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
I hadn't thought about that.

304
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,440
It's maybe because I feel so comfortable in it.

305
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
I just get to see it every day.

306
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes, and it's alive.

307
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,760
It actually breathes.

308
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
We're changing skin all the time.

309
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
So it's very interesting.

310
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,400
So a very medical related topic but very interesting as well because we didn't touch so many other

311
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
parts of the body.

312
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
For example, bones.

313
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
There are so many names of the different bones.

314
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
That's right.

315
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,080
And your tongue and your teeth and your eyes, all these different pieces and parts.

316
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,040
So definitely more stuff that we could talk about next time.

317
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
But for now we hope that you've learned something.

318
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,240
If you have questions or comments, as always, you can come to our website englishpod.com

319
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
and let us know.

320
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
All right guys, we'll see you there.

321
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Bye.

322
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Bye.

323
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Bye.
