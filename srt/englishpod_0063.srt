00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,120
And today we're bringing you a lesson that was requested by one of our listeners.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,220
Yes, that's right.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,520
We got a request for a dialogue about a receptionist.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,580
So a receptionist at an office or at a hotel.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,120
So today's dialogue is simple but we're going to be looking at some really great phrases.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,780
Yeah, phrases that will help you sound really, really professional and really fluent.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,880
So we are at an office today and the receptionist is greeting somebody that has an appointment.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:58,260
All right, let's see what happens.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,260
Good afternoon.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,740
May I help you?

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,460
Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,540
I have an appointment at four.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,540
Certainly.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,580
May I take your name?

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,260
I'll let her know you've arrived.

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,260
Sure.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,260
It's Josh O'Neill.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,460
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,380
Can I offer you something to drink?

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,140
Yes, coffee would be nice.

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:29,620
Thank you.

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,860
Here you are.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,820
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,140
I'll show you to her office right this way.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Just watch your step here.

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,940
Well that's pretty embarrassing, hey?

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,980
That was embarrassing.

31
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,580
That's what happens to women when they wear high heels, see?

32
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,140
Actually that happened to me last weekend.

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,140
Really?

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,740
I fell down the stairs and my knees are quite blue.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,580
Oh no, see?

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,140
High heels are dangerous.

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,780
I don't know why women wear them.

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,620
Well, I don't know, but that's not what we're here to discover.

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
Right.

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:26,740
Okay, so let's take a look at some of these great phrases in Fluency Builder.

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,540
I really liked how this receptionist used some excellent phrases to sound really professional.

42
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,020
One thing she said was, certainly.

43
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,340
Certainly.

44
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,620
Certainly.

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,660
So why did she say certainly?

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,780
Well this is a nice way to respond, to make the other person know that you understand

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,160
what they said.

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,860
So Josh O'Neil said, yes, I'm here to see you Joanna Stevens.

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,180
I have an appointment at four.

50
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Certainly.

51
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,500
So she is saying, I understand what you said.

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Yes.

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,580
So she said, may I take your name?

54
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,140
May I take your name?

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,100
May I take your name?

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,220
So this is a nice way of saying, what is your name?

57
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,220
Yeah.

58
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,020
So, now this is really important because if you said, what is your name?

59
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Is that correct?

60
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,260
It's correct, but it's not really very...

61
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,260
Exactly.

62
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,100
Or I would say polite to a certain extent.

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Yes.

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Okay.

65
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
So may I take your name?

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
May I take your name?

67
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,380
So you use this phrase when you are going to write down the person's name.

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
Right.

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,060
So if you meet somebody on the street or at a bar, you wouldn't say, may I take your name?

70
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
No.

71
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
Right.

72
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,620
Unless you're going to write it down.

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,340
So usually for an office setting where the receptionist has to write down the name.

74
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Yes.

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,100
Alright, one more phrase.

76
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,900
Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily.

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Okay.

78
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,340
So, Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily.

79
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,980
Will be with you momentarily.

80
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,340
Okay, so this is really polite.

81
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Yes.

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,180
Momentarily, what does that mean?

83
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
In a moment.

84
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Soon.

85
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,180
Soon.

86
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,700
Again, she could have said, Ms. Stevens will come out soon or Ms. Stevens will see you

87
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
in a minute.

88
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Yes.

89
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,140
But that's, again, it's not really that polite, right?

90
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Yeah.

91
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,580
So if you want to be formal, you can say, Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily.

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Okay.

93
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,340
That's a really nice phrase.

94
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,100
Alright, there's so much in this dialogue.

95
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,580
So many great, wonderful, polite phrases.

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:49,980
So why don't we listen to it one more time, but this time, slowed down.

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,620
Good afternoon.

98
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,180
May I help you?

99
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,900
Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,300
I have an appointment at four.

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
Certainly.

102
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,500
May I take your name?

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,540
I'll let her know you've arrived.

104
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,900
Sure.

105
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,940
It's Josh O'Neil.

106
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,540
Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily.

107
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Can I offer you something to drink?

108
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,140
Yes, coffee would be nice.

109
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,580
Thank you.

110
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,140
Here you are.

111
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,740
Ms. Stevens is ready for you now.

112
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,340
I'll show you to her office.

113
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,060
Right this way.

114
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,220
Just watch your step here.

115
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:45,620
Okay, so it's pretty clear now, but there are still a couple of phrases that I would

116
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,900
like to look at.

117
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,540
So why don't we look at the last two sentences?

118
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Okay.

119
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,820
Ms. Stevens is ready for you now.

120
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,780
Ms. Stevens is ready for you now.

121
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,060
Ms. Stevens is ready for you.

122
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,380
So when she says ready for you, what does that mean?

123
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,500
Prepared to speak to you.

124
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Okay.

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,980
So instead of saying Ms. Stevens is ready or Ms. Stevens can see you now, you use this

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,340
great little phrase, is ready for you.

127
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Okay.

128
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,020
And then she said I'll show you to her office.

129
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,260
I'll show you to her office.

130
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,900
I'll show you to her office.

131
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,180
This is a lovely way of saying I will take you to the office.

132
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,340
I will take you to the office.

133
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,260
And she followed it by saying right this way.

134
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,420
Right this way.

135
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,860
Right this way.

136
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,440
So again, walk this way.

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Walk this way.

138
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
This way, please.

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes.

140
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Right this way.

141
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,900
It sounds really, really nice, really polite, really welcoming.

142
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Right.

143
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,340
And especially if you use it together, right?

144
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,460
I'll show you to her office right this way, please.

145
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Yes.

146
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
Okay.

147
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,140
So it's a really great way of being polite to somebody at an office.

148
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,320
Now the final useful phrase, watch your step.

149
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,540
Watch your step.

150
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,660
Watch your step.

151
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,700
So watch your step.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,060
You see that everywhere in science.

153
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
Be careful.

154
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,260
Be careful where you step.

155
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Yes.

156
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,580
Be careful where you're walking.

157
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
Okay.

158
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,220
So obviously she didn't watch her step and she fell.

159
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
She fell.

160
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
Okay.

161
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,940
So really great phrases.

162
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:35,060
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

163
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Good afternoon.

164
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,500
May I help you?

165
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Yes.

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

167
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,380
I have an appointment at four.

168
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Certainly.

169
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
May I take your name?

170
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,020
I'll let her know you've arrived.

171
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Sure.

172
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,060
It's Josh O'Neill.

173
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,260
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

174
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,140
Can I offer you something to drink?

175
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,140
Yes.

176
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Coffee would be nice.

177
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:06,420
Thank you.

178
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,660
Here you are.

179
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,620
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

180
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,940
I'll show you to her office right this way.

181
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:25,540
Just watch your step here.

182
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,340
Alright so a really simple dialogue but with a lot of good phrases in there and it's also

183
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,180
a good review for more advanced students, right?

184
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Yeah.

185
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,420
