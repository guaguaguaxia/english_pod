00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,640
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,840
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,120
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
And today we're going to be taking you to the airport.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
That's right.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,120
We're going to listen as a man checks in at the airport and deals with his luggage.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
That's right.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,780
So we're going to be looking at a lot of great stuff that can help you the next time you

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,040
are at the airport at the check-in counter.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,480
So why don't we take a look at one word that we're going to preview today in Vocabulary

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Preview.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,540
Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,480
We're going to hear this guy say, I'd like to check three pieces.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,800
He's going to check three pieces of what?

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,660
Pieces of luggage.

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,560
So when we talk about luggage, we can say pieces of luggage.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
That's right.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,940
Luggage is a non-count noun.

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,180
So you can't say one luggage, two luggages, three luggages.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,180
That's wrong.

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,180
Right.

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,480
So we use pieces of luggage.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Okay.

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,080
He's going to check three pieces of luggage.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Very good.

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,840
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,720
We're going to see what happens with this guy at the airport and with his pieces of

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:17,480
luggage.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Next please.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,600
Hello, sir.

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,480
May I see your passport, please?

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Yes.

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Here you go.

35
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,040
Will you be checking any bags today?

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Yes.

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,520
I'd like to check three pieces.

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm sorry, sir.

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,640
Airline policy only allows two pieces of checked luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,160
of carry-on luggage.

41
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,800
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
What?

43
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Why?

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,920
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
That's absurd.

48
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm sorry, sir.

49
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
There's nothing I can do.

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,400
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

51
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,760
That bag is clearly too big.

53
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Now I see.

54
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,640
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

55
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,880
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,920
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Let's see.

58
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
$625 US dollars.

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:25,200
That's more than my round-trip ticket!

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,000
All right, well, that's a whole lot of money, isn't it?

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
Well, I think it's a very common situation.

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm sure many of our listeners can relate to this situation.

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,480
Overweight charges are pretty expensive.

64
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Very high.

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
I know from personal experience.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
But that's not what we want to talk about now.

67
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,280
We want to talk about some really useful vocabulary in Language Takeaway.

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Language Takeaway.

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,960
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we have five words.

70
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
So why don't we start with the first one?

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,000
So the woman asked, will you be checking any bags today?

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,680
Will you be checking any bags today?

73
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,000
To check bags.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Right.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,840
So the verb to check.

76
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,720
It means to give your bags to the airline, to register them.

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
Okay, so that's what happens with your luggage.

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,960
You check them, so basically they become responsible for your bags.

79
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Right.

80
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,680
It reminds me of checking in to a hotel.

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,880
Right, very similar.

82
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,600
When you go to a hotel, you register at the hotel.

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,120
You check in.

84
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,480
In this case, you just check your luggage.

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,640
You don't check in your luggage.

86
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Right.

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Okay, so check luggage.

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,400
So he wanted to check three pieces of luggage, and he also had carry-on luggage.

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
Carry-on luggage.

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
Carry-on.

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
So carry-on luggage, it's pretty simple.

92
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,680
That's right, you carry it on yourself.

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,320
Exactly, you carry it on to the plane.

94
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,200
Now we can talk about carry-on luggage, right?

95
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,680
Or carry-on bag.

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,960
Right, or a carry-on suitcase.

97
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,640
A very small suitcase that can fit under your seat.

98
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Exactly.

99
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,560
All right, so carry-on luggage.

100
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Now he was traveling on an intercontinental flight.

101
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,280
Intercontinental.

102
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,600
Intercontinental.

103
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
We have two words there, inter.

104
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Between.

105
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Between, right?

106
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
And continental.

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
So this sounds like continent.

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,640
Okay, so he's traveling maybe from Asia to North America.

109
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Okay, intercontinental.

110
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,320
He's trying to board this intercontinental flight.

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
So to board a flight.

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Board a plane.

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Board a train.

114
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
All right, so basically it means to...

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
To get on.

116
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
To get on.

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
To get on a vehicle.

118
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,360
Okay, so I can say board the ship, board the car.

119
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
No.

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
No?

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
No.

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
But board the train.

123
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Board the train.

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Board the bus.

125
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
All aboard.

126
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,560
That's right, that's why in movies you see that somebody will yell all aboard.

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Yeah.

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
In the train station, right?

129
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Exactly.

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
All aboard.

131
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,440
Okay, so board a vehicle and our last phrase for today, overhead compartment.

132
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,480
Overhead compartment.

133
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Overhead compartment.

134
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,160
All right, let's break this phrase down.

135
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
Overhead.

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,840
So that's on top of your head, right?

137
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Exactly.

138
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Above you.

139
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,120
Yeah, and the compartment is a place where you can put something and store it.

140
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Kind of like a box.

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Right.

142
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Yeah.

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,880
So overhead compartment, that big box where you put your bags and your purse or whatever

144
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
on an airplane.

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Mm-hmm.

146
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,160
Very similar to, for example, an overhead projector.

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Right, so that's the machine that puts an image or a picture on a wall, like sometimes

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,280
you see them in meetings.

149
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,840
Right, so because the image is over your head and it's big, it's called an overhead projector.

150
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,160
Okay, so some great language.

151
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,520
Why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for the second time?

152
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,000
Next, please.

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
Hello, sir.

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,960
May I see your passport, please?

155
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,440
Yes, here you go.

156
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,880
Will you be checking any bags today?

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

158
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm sorry, sir.

159
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,920
Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at 20 kilograms each, plus one piece

160
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,720
of carry-on luggage.

161
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,880
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

162
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
What?

163
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Why?

164
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

165
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

166
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,160
How am I supposed to take only two 20-kilo bags?

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
That's absurd.

168
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
There's nothing I can do.

170
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,960
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

171
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,080
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,680
That bag is clearly too big.

173
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Now I see.

174
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,860
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

175
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,080
But when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

176
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,200
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all this?

177
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Let's see.

178
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
$625 US dollars.

179
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
No.

180
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,440
That's more than my round-trip ticket.

181
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
All right.

182
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,080
So I think it's a little bit more clear now.

183
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,680
And with this, it's time for us to take a look at some great phrases in putting it together.

184
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Putting it together.

185
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,920
So this guy was pretty angry about this airline policy.

186
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,000
And he said, how am I supposed to?

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,960
How am I supposed to?

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
How am I supposed to?

189
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Okay.

190
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,480
So before we get into explaining this, why don't we listen to a couple of examples so

191
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,640
we can try and understand what it means.

192
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,840
Example one.

193
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,880
How am I supposed to fit the dog in the car?

194
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,080
There are 10 people in there already.

195
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,320
Example two.

196
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,040
How is she supposed to get to work if her car's in the shop?

197
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Example three.

198
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,480
How are we supposed to know the answer to that?

199
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,120
It's impossible.

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
Okay.

201
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
So I can understand that it means, how can I do this?

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Right.

203
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,360
How do you expect me to do this?

204
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,640
How is it possible for me to do this?

205
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Very good.

206
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,680
It's a phrase you use when you're frustrated, right?

207
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
When you're maybe a little bit frustrated or you're maybe nervous of something that

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,200
you can't do or don't know how.

210
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah.

211
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,720
This phrase, it's not impolite, but it sort of gives the idea that you're challenging

212
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
the other person a little bit.

213
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Maybe.

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Yeah.

215
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Okay.

216
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
So a good phrase that you can use in different situations and you can try and mix it up with

217
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
different verbs, right?

218
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Right.

219
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
All right.

220
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,040
Now let's take a look at our next phrase.

221
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
There's nothing I can do.

223
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
There's nothing I can do.

224
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,680
There's nothing I can do.

225
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
There's nothing I can do.

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,440
So basically, the woman can't help the man, even though he's insisting and he's pushing

227
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,760
that he wants another solution.

228
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Yeah.

229
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Right.

230
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,340
So finally, she says, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

231
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,840
So we use this phrase when someone's pushing you too much, right?

232
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Right.

233
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,920
And you would use it only in that situation towards the end because it is a little bit...

234
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
It's strong.

235
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,000
It's not in plight, but it's just, you're saying, you know what, I'm sorry, there's

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,960
I can't do anything about it.

237
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,160
Now let's move on to our third phrase.

238
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
You charge next to nothing.

239
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,840
Next to nothing.

240
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,000
Next to nothing.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Next to nothing.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
All right.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So we're talking about charging.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
We're talking about money.

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,240
Why don't we listen to some examples of what this next to nothing phrase means?

246
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,280
Example one.

247
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Do you like my new house?

248
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,280
It was so cheap that it almost cost next to nothing.

249
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Example two.

250
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,880
Let's go to Thailand.

251
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,560
Tickets cost next to nothing right now.

252
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,120
Example three.

253
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,920
The real estate agent charged me next to nothing for his commission, so I got a really good

254
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,440
deal.

255
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
So when something costs next to nothing, it's really cheap, right?

256
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,360
It's really cheap, or you consider it to be cheap.

257
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,800
And now for our last phrase, it's the complete opposite of next to nothing.

258
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Right.

259
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
Charge an arm and a leg.

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,080
An arm and a leg.

261
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,480
An arm and a leg.

262
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
All right.

263
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,800
So this means it's really expensive.

264
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,880
It's so expensive.

265
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,160
It's like giving your arm and your leg.

266
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Right.

267
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
To pay for it.

268
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Yeah.

269
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Very good.

270
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
So next to nothing, really cheap.

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,920
An arm and a leg, really expensive.

272
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Can we look at the use here?

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
All right.

274
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,800
So in the dialogue we heard, you charge an arm and a leg, but we can also say it costs

275
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
an arm and a leg.

276
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Right.

277
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Because we are referring to money.

278
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Right.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
All right.

280
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
So some great phrases here.

281
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:30,880
Now I think it's time we listen to our dialogue one more time.

282
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,120
What?

283
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Why?

284
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

285
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,720
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

286
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,920
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

287
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
That's absurd.

288
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm sorry, sir.

289
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,660
There's nothing I can do.

290
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,680
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

291
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,840
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

292
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,160
That bag is clearly too big.

293
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Now I see.

294
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,520
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

295
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,320
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

296
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,320
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

297
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Let's see.

298
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,840
625 US dollars.

299
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,960
That's more than my round trip ticket.

300
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Okay.

301
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,840
So airline policies, luggage, it's always a problem, right?

302
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Most of the time you always end up paying overweight when you travel.

303
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Yeah.

304
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,600
I know that this happened to me once and it was really expensive.

305
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Really?

306
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
What happened?

307
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,120
I was flying on an intercontinental flight from India back to Europe and I had too many

308
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,440
extra bags, but I really needed to bring them.

309
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
And so it cost me $6,000.

310
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
$6,000.

311
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Yeah.

312
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Wow.

313
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,120
So my credit card was pretty maxed out after that.

314
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
That's incredible.

315
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Yeah.

316
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,040
