00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,440
My name is Catherine and we are your English language guides here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,880
That's right and today we're going to be taking you to Christmas morning.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,880
It's Christmas Day.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
Oh, one of the best times of the year.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,040
You wake up, you smell the good smell of delicious eggs and bacon and there's presents.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,640
Yeah, I guess that's when you're a kid though.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
I guess when you're an adult, do you really get excited when you wake up for Christmas?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Hell yeah.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,040
Sure do.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,320
Yeah, I sure do.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,000
I love Christmas morning even as an adult.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Especially I think because of the special breakfast you get like pancakes, scrambled

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
eggs.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,080
But anyways, we're going to be taking a look at a situation here where a kid is opening

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,520
Christmas presents and we're preparing a meal for Christmas because that day people are

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
going to come over.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:01:06,560
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:26,800
Dad, dad, dad, wake up.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,360
It's Christmas.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,480
Timmy, it's too early for this.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,160
Look, it's six in the morning.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,440
Go back to bed.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,000
No way.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,560
Santa already came and left all our presents.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,640
Can we go open them, please, please?

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,080
Of course we can, honey.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,400
Bill, come on, get dressed.

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Fine.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,920
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:59,800
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Awesome.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,160
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,680
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Yeah, you're right.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,480
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
be perfect.

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,600
I got the list right here.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,120
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,000
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,680
All right, we're back.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,160
So there were a couple of different and interesting words there, so let's take a look at them

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,760
now in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,280
Okay, this first word is not a very happy word.

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,840
It's a word that we try not to use too much around the Christmas season, but sometimes

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,160
you're just tired of people because the holidays is all about people and doing stuff.

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,280
Someone who is not being very happy, someone who's a little bit grumpy is called a grouch.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Okay, so a person that's not very happy, not very friendly is a grouch.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,400
I don't want to open presents.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
This is stupid.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Okay, that's a grouch.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,600
Okay, so a person is a grouch, or you can act like a grouch, or be a grouch.

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Don't be a grouch!

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
All right.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,320
And, well, they were talking about heading to the market to buy something for dinner,

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,240
so to head to.

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,720
Okay, to head to is a way to say to go towards some place or to go somewhere.

61
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,320
All right, so if I'm driving my car and you ask me where I'm going, I'm saying,

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,400
oh, I'm heading to the bank.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Right, so to head to means to be on your way somewhere, I'm going somewhere.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,320
It's a way to say that you're in the process of going.

65
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,520
You can't say, next year I will head to Alaska.

66
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
It doesn't make as much sense.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,480
You usually say, I'm heading to the bank, or let's head to the market.

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,760
And well, they were talking about heading to the market because they are hosting Christmas

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,080
dinner, so to host.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,800
To host is a very important holiday term.

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,560
It's a verb, you do it, and it means that you are the person who has the special dinner

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
and your friends and family, they come to your house.

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,760
Okay, so we could say, this Christmas, I'm hosting the dinner at my house.

74
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,400
So, I want everyone to come to my house and eat.

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
All right, and it can also be a noun, right?

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,280
You can say, I am a host.

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Exactly.

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I'm the host of this dinner.

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
Right, and it doesn't have to be holidays either.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,320
You could say, hey, Marco, how about you host a dinner next week?

81
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
I'll come.

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Right, okay.

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I'll bring wine.

84
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,440
All right, so to host a dinner or to host a party, etc.

85
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,320
And our fourth word for language takeaway is probably the most popular drink during

86
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,280
the Christmas season, eggnog.

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,720
Okay, it sounds kind of disgusting.

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah, a drink with egg.

89
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,320
But it's a very popular creamy eggy drink.

90
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,640
It's very thick and it's cream colored.

91
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
And normally, you add a little bit of rum.

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Okay, so it's alcoholic.

93
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,400
And you drink it warm and it's kind of just a thick, warm alcoholic beverage that's very

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,320
very popular and my dad loves it.

95
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
During Christmas, right?

96
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
During Christmas.

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
You don't have it like any other day.

98
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
No, you wouldn't want to.

99
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
It's too heavy.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,040
But it's very very popular like the days before Christmas and on Christmas.

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,080
Okay, so eggnog.

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Very good.

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,040
So I think we should take a look at the dialogue again and we'll be back soon with Fluency

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Builder.

105
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Dad, dad, dad.

106
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Wake up.

107
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
It's Christmas.

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy.

109
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Timmy, Timmy.

110
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Timmy, Timmy.

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Timmy, Timmy.

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Timmy, Timmy.

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Timmy, Timmy.

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Timmy, Timmy.

115
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
As a child William used to be such a spendthrift

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
on Christmas Sunflowers.

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,480
He used to rub centrally into Santa's shirt, nothing more.

118
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,240
Now the trollis all of a sudden complaining about the Christmas Sunflowers getting cooked

119
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,020
up in the sun.

120
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,580
We used to need New Year's sunflowers but there weren't any Favorites and Timmy was

121
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,800
praying for his brother to cook up a perfect one.

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,680
And if you lied to Santa then you must have failed.

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,160
People go crazy to distribute gifts.

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Yeah, well now each has a Santa and a board and you remember you're Stu for now and suddenly

125
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Awesome!

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,960
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

127
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,480
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

128
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Yeah, you're right.

129
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,240
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
be perfect.

131
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,280
I've got the list right here.

132
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,920
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

133
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,320
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

134
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:47,360
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
Fluency Builder.

136
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,120
Okay, so this first phrase is a phrase that I often heard as a child because I never wanted

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
to go to sleep.

138
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,360
So I'd go downstairs and my parents would say, Catherine, go back to bed.

139
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Go back to bed.

140
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,640
Okay, go back to bed.

141
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,240
So this is just a very common colloquial spoken way of saying, go back to sleep.

142
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Go to sleep.

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Be awake.

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,000
So you can say, go to sleep, or you can say, go to bed, or if somebody has gotten out of

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,520
bed, you say, go back to bed.

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Exactly, and so parents often use this with their kids because they want their kids to

147
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
sleep.

148
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,520
You can also say it about someone who's up at night worrying, and you say, come on, go

149
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
back to bed.

150
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Go to sleep.

151
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Relax.

152
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay, and then we also saw this phrase, knock yourself out.

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,880
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

154
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
So what is this?

155
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Knock yourself out.

156
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,440
Well, I'm not really sure where this phrase comes from.

157
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,160
I mean, to knock is like to knock on a door, right?

158
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,360
But to knock yourself out, if I think about it, it probably means that you hit yourself

159
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,680
in the head and you fall over.

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,680
But the real meaning of this is, go have fun.

161
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
Have as much fun as you can have.

162
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,280
Right, have as much fun as you want.

163
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,440
Go knock yourself out.

164
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,920
So the parent is saying, hey, Timmy, go have as much fun as you want.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Just go do it.

166
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Enjoy yourself.

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,200
Yeah, like go open all these presents.

168
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
Have all the fun you want.

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Alright, and then we saw another phrase when they finished talking about dinner and all

170
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the things they have to buy.

171
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,440
They said, we should be set.

172
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,240
We should be set or we are set.

173
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,200
Well, this is funny because she says, well, my dad's going to bring the eggnog, so we

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,000
should be set, which means we should have everything we need.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
So we don't need anything else.

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
We're ready.

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Everything is good.

178
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Exactly.

179
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
So we can say, we are set.

180
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm set.

181
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,720
It's a way to say, are you ready?

182
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Are you prepared?

183
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,200
Do you have everything you need?

184
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,080
So I often use this when I'm going on a trip.

185
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Are you set?

186
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Did you pack everything?

187
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Are you all set?

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Are you all set?

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah.

190
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Alright.

191
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I finished packing.

192
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm all set.

193
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm ready to go.

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
All set and ready to go.

195
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Alright.

196
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Okay, so some interesting phrases there as well.

197
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Let's look at our dialogue for the last time.

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:34,160
Dad, dad, dad, wake up.

199
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
It's Christmas.

200
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,760
Timmy, it's too early for this.

201
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,520
Look, it's six in the morning.

202
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,800
Go back to bed.

203
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,400
No way.

204
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,920
Santa already came and left all our presents.

205
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Can we go open them, please?

206
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
Please?

207
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,520
Of course we can, honey.

208
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,840
Bill, come on, get dressed.

209
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,000
Fine.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,280
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

211
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:07,200
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,360
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

213
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Awesome.

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,520
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

215
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,040
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

216
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Yeah, you're right.

217
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,840
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to

218
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
be perfect.

219
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,960
I've got the list right here.

220
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,480
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

221
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,360
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

222
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,800
Alright, we're back.

223
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
As you mentioned, Christmas morning is great.

224
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,800
You open presents and breakfast.

225
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,600
It's a time to be together with your parents, your family, but as in this case, you can

226
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,920
be a little bit of a grouch because you're just kind of tired because you had Thanksgiving

227
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,920
and November and then Christmas, and now you're having New Year's, so you're kind of just

228
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
like, ugh.

229
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,760
The holiday season can be exhausting, and I know a lot of families have a special dinner

230
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
on the 24th.

231
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,840
That's Christmas Eve, and then by the time it's Christmas Day, the 25th, you're exhausted,

232
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,600
you didn't get any sleep, you might have had too much to drink last night, and so it can

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
be very tiring.

234
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,000
Also, because the kids always get up way too early, like 6 o'clock.

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,120
Right, to open their presents, right?

236
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,400
And then they'll be playing with their toys all day, and you'll have a headache.

237
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,920
But it's a great season to spend time with the family, and we want to know how you spend

238
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,200
your Christmas Eve and your Christmas morning, so why don't you come to our website EnglishPod.com

239
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,520
and leave your questions and comments there as well.

240
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,040
We're looking forward to hearing from you.

241
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Again, happy holiday season, and until next time.

242
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Bye.

243
