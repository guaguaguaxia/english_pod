00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,760
My name is Kathryn and today we have a very, very useful intermediate level lesson for

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,240
you all about the weather.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
That's right.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,500
So obviously we have seen the news and sometimes on the news we have the weather report.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,180
So today we're going to learn all about that weather report in English.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,640
So let's check out today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the words

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:34,360
and phrases that those weather forecasters used.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,680
And those are today's top stories.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,440
Now let's go to John for the weather.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,080
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,180
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,420
It will be drizzling all day today and there's a 60% chance of thunderstorms this evening.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,720
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,360
In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,520
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,120
Will it rain on Saturday?

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,800
Unfortunately, yes.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
It will be clear early Saturday morning, but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,080
later in the day.

23
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,120
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,040
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,620
experiencing record high rainfalls.

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,300
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,840
It gets better on Sunday, though.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,040
The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,800
It will still be rather cool with highs in the low 50s.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,200
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
come out.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,640
Back to you, Mary.

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Thanks, John.

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
And there you have it.

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,800
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,920
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,160
So apparently, they're not going to have great weather this weekend and they actually started

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
with an interesting word.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,120
And actually, the commentator started with asking the weatherman, John, what does the

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,320
forecast look like for our weekend?

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,440
Okay, so the word here, forecast, is very, very important because it describes this part

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,960
of the newscast.

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:29,280
A forecast is basically a prediction or a description of the future weather situation.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
That's right.

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
So we're talking about the weather forecast.

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,500
Now it's very interesting because we can also use that in business, for example, in budgets.

48
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,560
You can say, what is the financial forecast of the company?

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
All right, so you can't know what will happen, but you can predict it and that's what a forecast

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
is.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
That's right.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,600
So we're talking about the weather forecast and the weatherman said that, well, there

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,920
are some storms coming and it will be drizzling all day.

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,640
Okay, so to drizzle is a verb and it's like the verb to rain, except it's less by degree.

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
So it's very light rain.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,720
Yeah, it's kind of like if I spray you with water from a spray can or something, it's

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
like drizzle.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,920
It's just little dots of water.

59
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,840
It's not like you're getting wet.

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't really have the normal heavy raindrops.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,720
You just have a little bit of water coming down.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,920
But it's annoying because do you bring your umbrella?

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,440
Do you leave your umbrella?

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,440
So drizzling is a kind of rain that's very, very light.

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
That's right.

66
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,240
All right, so it's going to drizzle all day and the weatherman also said that we might

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
have some thunderstorms.

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,960
Okay, so thunderstorms are very different.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,680
Thunderstorms are a kind of storm where there is thunder.

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,800
So thunder is the loud noises when there's lightning.

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Lightning, okay.

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,060
So lightning is like the flash that you get from the sky and thunder is the hard sound

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
that comes after.

74
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,060
The boom.

75
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
That's right.

76
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,840
Yeah, so remember light, lightning.

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,940
Light is the light that comes down from the sky, lightning.

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,400
And thunderstorms are just those loud noises that the lightning makes.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,160
So usually with thunderstorms, we have very heavy rain.

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
That's right.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,840
And that's why it's different from drizzling, which is very light.

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Okay.

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
Now we're talking about water.

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,320
We have drizzle, we have thunderstorm.

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,960
Now what about a shower?

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,440
Because the weatherman said there is a high chance of showers.

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
Well, yes, there's a high chance of showers.

88
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,440
I take showers every day, thank you very much.

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,240
But that's not the kind of shower we're talking about here, is it?

90
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
That's right.

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Think about it though.

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
It's similar.

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,640
A shower when you wash yourself is water coming down on top of you.

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,160
Well, in this case, it's a rain shower.

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,360
So it's rain that's happening.

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Okay, so it's rain water that's coming down, very similar to the shower that you take in

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
the morning.

98
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,200
The difference though is that a shower is a noun and to rain is a verb.

99
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,960
So it will rain tomorrow or we expect showers tomorrow.

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Both mean the same thing.

101
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
All right.

102
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Very good.

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,360
And well, talking about showers and thunderstorms, there's also another type of water that falls

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
from the sky.

105
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
This is called hail.

106
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Okay.

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,120
And hail is difficult to describe because it's like ice, but it's not really.

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,920
It's just usually hard, almost like marbles, like hard balls of rain that come down.

109
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
So it's not snow.

110
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
That's right.

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,260
It hurts when it hits you.

112
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,060
Sometimes it's very big, sometimes it's very small, but it's heavy, hard things that come

113
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
out of the clouds.

114
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Yeah.

115
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
So just think about it.

116
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
It's very, very similar to ice.

117
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,040
It's the small pieces of ice coming down from the sky.

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
So that's hail.

119
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Obviously, very different from snow because as we said, it's hard.

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
Snow is very soft.

121
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Yes.

122
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,200
And well, with this type of weather going on in the weekend, the commentator said, wow,

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
that certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

124
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Okay.

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Dreary is a great word to describe it.

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,440
So as you can tell, it's going to rain.

127
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Dreary is not a good thing.

128
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
It's not a happy thing.

129
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Okay.

130
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,960
So something is dreary when it's not very exciting.

131
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,120
It looks like it'll be dull or sad or boring or dark.

132
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,200
Now can you describe a person like this as well?

133
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Yes.

134
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,720
He's a very dreary person.

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
He's never optimistic.

136
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,400
He's always down and yeah, kind of quiet and sad and down.

137
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Boring.

138
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah.

139
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Okay.

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
So that's what it means.

141
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,280
Something that's boring, not very exciting or very calm.

142
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,360
But also dark.

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
There's a dark element to it because something is dreary.

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
You know, there's no sunshine.

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
There's no light.

146
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
There's no optimism.

147
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,520
So you can say it's a dreary day.

148
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Yeah.

149
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Very dreary day today.

150
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
No light, no sunshine.

151
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Okay.

152
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Very good.

153
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab there.

154
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:45,040
Why don't we review what we've just learned and listen to the dialogue again.

155
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,380
And those are today's top stories.

156
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,280
Now let's go to John for the weather.

157
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,760
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

158
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

159
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,880
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

160
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,120
It will be drizzling all day today and there's a 60% chance of thunderstorms this evening.

161
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,400
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

162
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,080
In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

163
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,200
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

164
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,840
Will it rain on Saturday?

165
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,480
Unfortunately, yes.

166
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,520
It will be clear early Saturday morning, but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms

167
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,800
later in the day.

168
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,560
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast.

169
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,800
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been

170
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,380
experiencing record high rainfalls.

171
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,060
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

172
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,600
It gets better on Sunday, though.

173
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,800
The storm systems move East and the skies will clear up at night.

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,560
It will still be rather cool with highs in the low 50s.

175
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,960
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will

176
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
come out.

177
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,920
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

178
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Back to you, Mary.

179
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Thanks, John.

180
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
And there you have it.

181
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,360
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.

182
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,560
All right.

183
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
We're back.

184
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:15,840
So now, we're going to talk a little bit about some phrases that we've chosen for you on

185
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,320
Fluency Builder.

186
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,680
Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,560
So when we're talking about forecasts, remember that we're talking about things that aren't

188
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
certain.

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,040
We have to explain that there is a possibility of rain or a possibility of sunshine.

190
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,080
And usually, in the weather report, they will use percentages to describe how likely something

191
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
is to happen.

192
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
That's right.

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,360
The weatherman said there is a 60% chance of thunderstorms.

194
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
OK.

195
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,960
So 60% is not very likely, but it's also not unlikely.

196
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,240
It means that it might happen that it rains.

197
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
That's right.

198
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,800
So as you said, it's a way to measure what the probabilities are.

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,560
Because imagine if the weatherman says it might rain tomorrow, you're like, well, maybe

200
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,160
it really will, or maybe it's very unlikely that it won't, or we don't really know.

201
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Exactly.

202
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,040
So for example, if the weatherman says there's a 95% chance of rain tomorrow, do you bring

203
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
your umbrella?

204
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Yes.

205
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,920
What if he says there's a 5% chance of rain tomorrow?

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
No.

207
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
No.

208
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
So you have to think about the probability.

209
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,080
60%, it's maybe half and half.

210
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,160
But 95%, it's very likely to happen.

211
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
That's right.

212
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,840
And he also mentioned there's a high chance of thunderstorms, or maybe you can say there's

213
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,880
a low chance of hail.

214
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Right.

215
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,920
So he's basically saying, he or she is basically saying, you know, it's possible that this

216
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
will happen, or it's not likely this will happen.

217
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,120
They're trying to help you out.

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,520
They can't say this will happen, because they don't know.

219
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
OK.

220
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,120
So the key word for probability here, the key word is chance.

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,320
There is a good chance that it will rain.

222
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
So chance is probability.

223
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Right.

224
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,000
So for example, what's the chance it will rain tomorrow?

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
Well, there's a high chance.

226
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
OK.

227
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Very good.

228
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
OK.

229
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,280
And now when we talk about the degrees, or how warm or cold it is, so we express it in

230
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,320
Fahrenheit in some countries, or in other countries in centigrade.

231
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,000
Here we talk about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,240
But the weatherman also says highs and lows.

233
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,200
There's a low of around 40 degrees.

234
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,780
What does he mean, a low?

235
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,960
This is a really important part of the forecast, because you need to know, will you have to

236
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
bring a coat tomorrow?

237
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,880
Is it going to be hot or cold?

238
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,400
And so you think about a day, usually during the day at noon, or 1 o'clock in the afternoon,

239
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
it's the hottest.

240
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,360
But at night, it's the coldest.

241
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,520
And so the low refers to the lowest temperature, and the high refers to the highest temperature.

242
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,360
So for example, in the fall, maybe the highs are 60 degrees, but the lows are 40.

243
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
So you should bring a coat.

244
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
OK.

245
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,800
It means at night, it'll be 40, and during the day, it'll be 60.

246
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
OK.

247
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,200
So we're talking about the highs are the highest temperatures, or the highest number that we'll

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,080
get, and the lows is the lowest.

249
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,400
So the weatherman will commonly say, tomorrow we'll experience a high of 32 degrees and

250
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,560
a low of 25.

251
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Right.

252
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,600
So it's very easy to understand that the temperature during the day will be between these two numbers.

253
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Right.

254
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Very good.

255
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
OK.

256
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,800
And for our last phrase, the weatherman also said that there is a severe thunderstorm warning

257
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,240
for some parts of the Southeast.

258
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
All right.

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,640
So, Marco, this is a really key phrase, because it's telling people about potential danger.

260
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,500
You know, a thunderstorm can be very dangerous, so you want to stay inside.

261
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,240
So a severe thunderstorm warning, severe means very, very serious, is something you should

262
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,400
pay attention to.

263
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
That's right.

264
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,000
But now, the interesting thing is that we can change the noun, in this case, thunderstorm,

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,600
and we can talk about, for example, a severe tornado warning.

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
All right.

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,360
So if there's a severe tornado warning, then I really have to pay attention to the weather

268
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,160
and be careful not to go outside.

269
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
Or even a severe flood warning.

270
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,000
You need to know that the streets might become flooded and prepare.

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,760
So they're saying that there's a very high probability that this might happen, so they're

272
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,440
warning you to take precaution.

273
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
All right.

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
So pay attention to that last one.

275
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
And we're going to listen to today's dialogue one more time.

276
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:22,920
We'll be back in a moment to talk a little bit more about the weather.

277
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,240
And those are today's top stories.

278
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,720
Now let's go to John for the weather.

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,640
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

280
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

281
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,740
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

282
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,980
It will be drizzling all day today, and there's a 60% chance of thunderstorms this evening.

283
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,280
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

284
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,960
In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

285
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,080
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

286
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,800
Will it rain on Saturday?

287
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,400
Unfortunately, yes.

288
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,420
It will be clear early Saturday morning, but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms

289
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,680
later in the day.

290
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,720
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast.

291
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,680
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been

292
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
experiencing record high rainfalls.

293
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,920
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

294
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
It gets better on Sunday, though.

295
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,660
The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night.

296
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,420
It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s.

297
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,840
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will

298
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
come out.

299
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,800
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

300
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
Back to you, Mary.

301
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,280
Thanks, John.

302
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,480
And there you have it.

303
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,600
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.

304
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,640
All right.

305
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,640
So talking about the weather, it always seems like the weatherman is always wrong.

306
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Always.

307
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,760
It's like the opposite of what should happen.

308
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
That's right.

309
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,480
But you can't blame them because all they have is a computer and some sensors and they

310
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,000
have to guess about the weather and help people figure out what to do.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,380
Have you ever experienced anything severe like a hard thunderstorm or maybe a tornado

312
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
or something like this?

313
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,560
I have, actually, because I'm from Chicago.

314
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,140
And in America, the middle of the country is called the tornado belt.

315
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,180
That means it's a piece of land where tornadoes are very common.

316
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,340
And so in the fall and in the spring, we often have tornadoes.

317
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,880
And I've been in a couple of tornadoes myself.

318
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Oh, wow.

319
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Have you seen them?

320
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Yes.

321
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Is it amazing to see?

322
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
They're very scary.

323
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,600
You're always running inside and locking yourself in the basement.

324
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,080
It's very important to protect yourself in a tornado because it's very dangerous around

325
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,500
the area of the tornado because the wind is so strong that trucks and cars and telephone

326
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,240
poles and big, big heavy objects can fly through the air and hurt people.

327
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,280
And that's how most of the damage happens.

328
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,720
Okay, so this is interesting because a tornado is also considered a natural disaster.

329
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,480
But it's a weather phenomenon, whereas earthquakes are a natural disaster, but it's not part

330
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
of the weather.

331
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
No, yeah, you're right.

332
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
It's not something that it sweeps in and it leaves.

333
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,620
Like a flood, for example, all of the rain will come down and it will create a flood.

334
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,560
An earthquake is a natural disaster that's not weather related.

335
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
That's right.

336
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Okay, interesting thing.

337
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,240
Maybe some of our listeners that live in a very cold area have experienced a heavy snowstorm.

338
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Like a blizzard.

339
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,380
Like a blizzard.

340
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,820
Or maybe people in a tropical area have experienced a hurricane.

341
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,860
So let us know if you've ever been in one of these weather related phenomenons.

342
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,740
And also if you have any comments or questions, we're always at EnglishPod.com.

343
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
We hope to see you guys there.

344
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
All right.

345
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Thanks for listening.
