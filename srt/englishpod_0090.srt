00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,900
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,180
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,220
And today we're bringing you the eighth part of our dramatic romantic love story, I'm sorry

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,220
I love you.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,820
That's right, we're coming close to the end of this story, aren't we?

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,060
Yeah, we're coming close to the end and we still have a lot of interesting things going

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,060
on so I wonder what's going to happen.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,260
Well, I can tell you that today's lesson involves this word which we'll hear in vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,500
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,900
So today we're just going to look at this one word, spy.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,180
A spy.

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,540
A spy.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,540
Spy.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,420
Alright, so we probably know famous spies like James Bond.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,780
Or Austin Powers.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
Right.

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,460
So basically it's a person who is secretly trying to get information.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,220
About a government or maybe a business.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,220
Right.

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,220
So that's a spy.

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,540
Now the verb, to spy.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,820
Same thing, right?

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,820
To spy on someone.

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,740
To spy on a company.

26
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,780
So why are we talking spies and spying here on EnglishPod?

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:35,780
Why don't we find out by listening to our dialogue.

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:45,220
Hi Steven.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:16,780
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica. I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government.

30
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,780
What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,780
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:42,780
It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist. One day he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the Millennium in his small lab back at the university, where he taught biochemistry.

33
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father, and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

34
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,780
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? And most importantly, why did you lie to me?

35
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:04,780
I'm sorry. I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you. But you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

36
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:12,780
I can't believe this. Why are all these things happening to me? I can't take it anymore. Let me out of the car.

37
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
Veronica, wait!

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:26,780
Alright, so Stephen is not even American. He's an Indian spy.

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
He's not even a firefighter.

40
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,780
Well, there you go.

41
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Oh my God.

42
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,780
Many surprises on this love story.

43
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
It gets deeper and deeper.

44
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this great story in Language Takeaway.

45
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,780
Language Takeaway

46
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Well, here we've got a lot of language that you can use when you need to be honest about something.

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,780
We're going to look at six phrases here. Now, the first one, Stephen says he needs to come clean.

48
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Come clean.

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
Come clean.

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,780
Right, so basically he needs to tell the truth.

51
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,780
He needs to confess.

52
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780
Confess, right.

53
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,780
About something that he maybe wasn't truthful about in the past.

54
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,780
Yeah, maybe he had a secret or maybe he lied about something.

55
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
Yep.

56
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,780
So, now he's coming clean.

57
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Very good.

58
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:26,780
So, he comes clean and he tells the story about his childhood and he says his father was a renowned chemist.

59
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
Renowned.

60
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Renowned.

61
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Okay, so if you're a renowned chemist.

62
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,780
You're very famous and well respected.

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,780
So, you can use that with people or with places.

64
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,780
A renowned restaurant.

65
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Okay, so very popular, very well known.

66
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,780
We also hear it commonly like this, a world renowned chemist.

67
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
A world renowned restaurant.

68
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,780
So, not only popular locally, but the whole world knows about it.

69
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Very good.

70
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,780
Alright, and so he continues with his story and he says he was approached by members of the CIA.

71
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Approached.

72
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,780
To be approached by.

73
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Okay, so if I am approached by somebody from the CIA, what does that mean?

74
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,780
Well, they come to talk to you about something really important.

75
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,780
Okay, so the verb to approach someone can mean get close to.

76
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
Right, to walk up to them or something like that.

77
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Right, but it also carries this meaning of coming to talk to you about something.

78
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
Something important.

79
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Something very important.

80
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Yep.

81
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,780
So, for example, I can say my boss approached me this morning to talk about an important pay raise.

82
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Oh, lucky you. Or maybe Jim approached me to ask if I know if his wife is cheating on him or not.

83
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Wow. Alright, so that's how you would use this verb, approach someone.

84
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
Now, let's move on to the next word.

85
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,780
So, he was approached by members of the CIA and they were claiming something about his father.

86
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,780
That's right. So, to claim.

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,780
Claim something.

88
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
To claim something.

89
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Alright, so basically when you're claiming something, you are saying that it's true.

90
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
Right, it might not be true.

91
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
But we don't know.

92
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,780
Yep. So, for example, he claims he makes $4 million a year.

93
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Okay, or Bob claims that he saw a UFO.

94
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,780
We can't prove it if it's true or not, but that's what they're saying is true.

95
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Yep.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,780
So, Stephen's father disappeared and, well, he vowed to discover where he was.

97
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,780
So, Stephen vowed to find his father.

98
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Vow.

99
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
To vow.

100
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,780
So, this verb, to vow, means to make a strong promise, right?

101
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
Yes.

102
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
And we use it also in marriage, right?

103
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,780
Wedding vows.

104
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Wedding vows, which are basically promises.

105
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,780
So, if you vow something, you make a very strong promise.

106
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,780
Yes, it's very, very bad if you break a vow.

107
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Oh, really? What happens?

108
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I don't know, probably thunder strikes you and you die.

109
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Alright, so don't break your vows.

110
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,780
And the last word on Language Takeaway today, the whereabouts.

111
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
The whereabouts.

112
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
The whereabouts of his father.

113
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
So, the whereabouts is the location.

114
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
The location.

115
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Kind of unknown location, right?

116
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Right. I think this is a great word for us to listen to some more examples.

117
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Example 1.

118
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,780
The police don't have any information on the whereabouts of the murderer.

119
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Example 2.

120
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Currently, the whereabouts of the president are unknown.

121
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Example 3.

122
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,780
You live in Toronto too? Whereabouts do you live?

123
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Alright, so whereabouts. Perfect.

124
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,780
You can use it for location, unknown location.

125
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,780
Alright, so some great words.

126
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,780
Now, I want to move on to some phrases that we use a lot in the US.

127
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Some great words. Now, I want to move on to some phrases that we heard in the dialogue.

128
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,780
And let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

129
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Alright, on Fluency Builder today, we have four great phrases.

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
And let's start with the first one.

131
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,780
So, Veronica asks, what's going on?

132
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Basically, what's happening, right?

133
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,780
What's happening, what's the situation?

134
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Now, another interesting thing is that among friends, you could use this phrase to say,

135
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,780
Hey, how are you? How's it going?

136
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
So, you can say, hey, Erica, what's going on?

137
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,780
And it all depends on your tone of voice.

138
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,780
So, when you want to know how that person is, hey, Marco, what's going on?

139
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,780
Right, but if you're angry or maybe something strange is happening, you're like, hey, what's going on here?

140
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,780
Yes, so your voice falls.

141
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:56,780
Right, now let's take a look at our next phrase. And this one is very, very useful, especially if you've lied.

142
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Yes, so Stephen says, I haven't been completely honest with you.

143
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,780
I haven't been completely honest with you.

144
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,780
I haven't been completely honest with you.

145
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,780
So, that means he hasn't been telling the whole truth.

146
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Right, pretty easy to understand, but I think its use is interesting here.

147
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,780
Right, you might use it to kind of soften up the person to confess something.

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:27,780
Right, so when you're ready to come clean about a secret you have or a lie you told, this is a great way to prepare your listener.

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Right, you know what? I haven't been completely honest with you.

150
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Moving on to our third phrase.

151
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,780
So, the CIA claimed that Stephen's father had made the discovery of the millennium.

152
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,780
The discovery of the millennium.

153
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Discovery of the millennium.

154
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Okay, let's break this down. Millennium.

155
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Millennium is a thousand years.

156
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
Right.

157
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,780
So, the discovery of the millennium is...

158
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,780
The best, most important discovery in the past thousand years.

159
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,780
Right, so now we can change it a little bit and say the invention of the millennium.

160
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Or even the party of the millennium.

161
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Exactly, so it doesn't necessarily have to be the most important of the last one thousand years.

162
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
But it means it was pretty good.

163
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
It was pretty good or very important.

164
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Hey, you can also say the discovery of the decade, right?

165
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,780
Of the decade, of the century, of the year.

166
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,780
And now let's take a look at our last phrase.

167
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:28,780
So, Stephen confessed he came clean, he told her everything, but he said he wasn't supposed to fall in love with her.

168
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
I wasn't supposed to.

169
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

170
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Alright, so let's look at this phrase, I wasn't supposed to.

171
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:44,780
It's an interesting one, it's sort of like a cross between I didn't need to and I shouldn't have done.

172
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,780
Right, now let's look at some examples.

173
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I wasn't supposed to come to work today.

174
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Alright, so you didn't need to.

175
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
It wasn't necessary.

176
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Alright, so maybe it was your annual vacation day but you came into work anyway.

177
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Or maybe it was a holiday and I came to work anyways.

178
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,780
So, the plan was not for you to come to work.

179
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Right, so in this case we're saying it wasn't necessary.

180
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Or it wasn't planned.

181
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Or planned.

182
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Now let's look at it the other way, when you shouldn't.

183
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Okay, Marco I wasn't supposed to tell you this but...

184
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Okay, so now in this case you shouldn't be telling me this, you shouldn't tell me the secret, but you're going to anyways.

185
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Yes, off air.

186
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,780
So, I wasn't supposed to, in this case it means I shouldn't.

187
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,780
Alright, some really great language here, now I think it would help us to hear it one more time in the dialogue.

188
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, are you okay?

189
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Steven, what's going on? Who were those guys?

190
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,780
I didn't know you have a gun. What's going on?

191
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, okay?

192
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,780
For now you have to trust me, please, I would never do anything to hurt you.

193
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Steven, I...

194
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:35,780
Okay, run!

195
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,780
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica, I'm sorry.

196
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,780
I'm not a fireman, I'm not even from the United States.

197
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm a spy for the Indian government.

198
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,780
What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?

199
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,780
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

200
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,780
It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist.

201
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:11,780
One day he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the Millennium in his small lab back at the university, where he taught biochemistry.

202
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:18,780
When I saw him again, I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father, and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

203
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:24,780
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? And most importantly, why did you lie to me?

204
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,780
I'm sorry. I wasn't supposed to meet you, I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

205
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,780
But you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

206
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:41,780
I can't believe this. Why are all these things happening to me? I can't take it anymore. Let me out of the car.

207
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Veronica, wait!

208
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:56,780
Okay, great. So now we're getting close to the end of this series. So what's gonna happen? Maybe Veronica is also a spy.

209
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
Oh my God, I don't think I can handle that.

210
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:07,780
Alright, so we really need your suggestions, we need your ideas. We want to know how you think the series ends or how you would want it to end.

211
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
Do you want it to be a happy ending?

212
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Or a tragedy?

213
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Or maybe action-filled ending?

214
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Alright, well, we've got two lessons left in this series, so visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave your suggestions.

215
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,780

216
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
Goodbye!

217
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Bye!
