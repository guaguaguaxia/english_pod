00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,920
Welcome back to another advanced lesson here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,960
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,320
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,960
And today we're going to be back in the office.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
That's right.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,520
We are listening in as somebody gets a little bit of trouble from their boss for being a

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,280
bit late on a project.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,480
Alright so we're going to be at the office.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,160
Somebody misses a deadline and so well how do you handle the situation?

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,920
What can you do to explain yourself?

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,240
And what language can you actually use to talk about missed deadlines and late work?

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:51,960
Alright so let's see why this person missed the deadline and let's find out what happens.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,880
And so I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,280
As you know, you missed a fairly significant deadline last week and this will negatively

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,360
I know.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,960
But really it wasn't my fault.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,840
You see we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute and I couldn't

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,960
get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
analysis.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,500
You know if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable then I wouldn't

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,840
have missed my deadline.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,360
Oh come on!

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,400
An excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,020
You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues rather than accepting

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,760
responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,040
No I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,600
I know it was me who was ultimately responsible for getting this done.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,400
But the thing is I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,880
And you know with everything I've got going on now I can't afford to waste time dealing

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
with technical problems.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,800
I've got a lot on my plate and there are only 24 hours in a day.

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm not going to accept this excuse.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,640
You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,680
fact that you've missed your deadline.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,040
Look we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,140
No more phony excuses.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,520
If you're in over your head you tell me.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,160
No more missed deadlines.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:33,640
Now I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.

43
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,040
Well it sounds like this guy isn't really accepting a lot of the responsibility for

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
his missed deadline.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Exactly.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
Well apparently he's explaining that it wasn't only his fault.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Yeah.

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,760
So some technical problems but you know he used a lot of pretty pretty interesting language

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
and I think it'll help us to look at that now in Language Takeaway.

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
All right.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,360
So on Language Takeaway today we have five words and let's start with the first one.

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
All right.

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,440
Well the boss is not really happy with the excuse that the employee was giving and he

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,080
said an excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,560
Tantamount.

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Tantamount to something.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,520
OK so if an excuse like that is tantamount to lying what is what is he trying to say

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
here.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,200
Basically it's the same as or it's almost the same as.

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,800
So similar to.

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,520
So if I say tantamount to something else how would I use it.

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,940
You know Marco taking my computer without asking is tantamount to stealing.

64
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,960
OK so even though I'm not actually stealing it or taking it home with me.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Yeah.

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
It is almost like stealing.

67
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Yeah.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,480
And the interesting grammatical thing here is that we almost always use a gerund right

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,040
after so tantamount to verb ing.

70
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,080
OK tantamount to stealing tantamount to lying tantamount to killing.

71
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
OK.

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,200
Well on that happy note let's go on to our next word.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,920
Now the boss was really unhappy with the employee for procrastinating.

74
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
Procrastinating.

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Procrastinating.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,720
So the verb is to procrastinate.

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,000
And when you procrastinate you say I'll do it later I'll do it tomorrow.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,680
OK so you kind of delay things or you leave it for another day.

79
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah.

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
All right.

81
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Very good.

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
So to procrastinate.

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,800
A favorite verb amongst college students.

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,040
I actually thought for a little while that procrastinate was to have babies.

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh.

86
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Oh.

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
OK.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
It's kind of similar.

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
What's the word.

90
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Procreate.

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Procreate.

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
So I thought procrastinate was like having babies like why are you procrastinating.

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,800
And I'm like I'm not.

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
Well glad you got that straight.

95
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,800
So yes our listeners procrastinate is not the same as procreate.

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
OK.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,760
I learned that the hard way.

98
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Yes.

99
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,640
Well it sounds like you had a little bit of a glitch in your understanding of language

100
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,160
and that's our next phrase.

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,760
So in the dialogue they were talking about some glitches with the system.

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,600
A glitch in the system.

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
OK.

104
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
So a glitch.

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Now this is common among computers right.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,920
A glitch is an error.

107
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Right.

108
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,200
So when you're talking about a glitch and you're talking about computers it's an error

109
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,280
a mistake.

110
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,760
But we also use it to talk about any unexpected problem.

111
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,440
A small unexpected problem.

112
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
OK.

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
So a small glitch.

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah.

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,700
There was a glitch in our plan and we arrived 10 minutes late.

116
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,580
Or I can say this movie has a glitch in the story.

117
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,480
So there's a small problem in the story that doesn't make sense.

118
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Exactly.

119
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
All right.

120
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,320
So the boss was blaming his lateness on these small technical glitches.

121
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,760
But the boss didn't believe this right.

122
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,800
The boss said you're trying to rationalize the fact that you missed the deadline.

123
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
OK.

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
To rationalize.

125
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,700
To rationalize.

126
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,160
So the boss is saying that he's trying to rationalize.

127
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,080
So that means is he trying to make sense of it.

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,680
Well this is an interesting psychological word.

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,640
Because when you rationalize something you think about it or describe it like especially

130
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,900
some bad behavior in a way that makes it seem better or proper or more sensible.

131
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,400
So you're trying to convince yourself.

132
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah.

133
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,440
You're telling other people but you're also telling yourself that it's better.

134
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
OK.

135
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,080
Or that you're right when you're actually wrong.

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Yes.

137
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Yeah.

138
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
OK.

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,780
So he was trying to rationalize the fact that he missed the deadline.

140
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,960
So he was trying to explain to the boss and also kind of make himself believe that it

141
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
wasn't really his fault when it was.

142
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
Now because this is a little bit of a difficult concept to understand I think we should hear

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
some examples.

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,460
Example one.

145
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,680
You can't rationalize your son's behavior by saying he's going through a hard time.

146
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Example two.

147
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,440
As much as I tried I couldn't rationalize buying such an expensive pair of shoes.

148
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,140
Example three.

149
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,920
You know it was the wrong thing to do.

150
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Stop trying to rationalize it.

151
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
OK.

152
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,480
So clear as daylight now this word rationalize.

153
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
All right.

154
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,280
In our final word.

155
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,080
So the boss really wasn't happy with these excuses and he said no more phony excuses.

156
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
OK.

157
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Phony.

158
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Phony.

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
P-H-O-N-Y.

160
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Phony.

161
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
So phony is basically false or fake.

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Right.

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
So a phony statement.

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
A phony watch.

165
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
OK.

166
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
A fake watch.

167
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Yeah.

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Not a Sony watch but a phony watch.

169
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
A phony.

170
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,720
So a lot of great words in this dialogue but as you mentioned we also saw some very interesting

171
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,040
phrases that we can use in situations like this.

172
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,200
So why don't we start now with Fluency Builder.

173
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Fluency Builder.

174
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,520
Well you know one of the interesting things about English is that we have a lot of ways

175
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,240
to make things sound more direct less direct harder or softer and in this dialogue there

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,040
are a few examples of how we use softening words to but just to do the opposite to actually

177
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,560
make it a little strong.

178
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
OK.

179
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,640
So why don't we start with the first paragraph in the first part of the dialogue.

180
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,200
He said you missed a fairly significant deadline.

181
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,040
A fairly significant deadline.

182
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,360
Now this word fairly kind of sort of.

183
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,160
So it's not very significant.

184
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's kind of significant.

185
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah.

186
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,380
But in this context when when the person is saying it it just sounds a little bit softer

187
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,480
but your understanding is it's a very important deadline.

188
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
OK.

189
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
A very important deadline.

190
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,320
So another similar example of this is the boss was saying you're essentially blaming

191
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
the tech team.

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
OK.

193
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,780
You're essentially blaming.

194
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,800
So essentially is like basically or pretty much.

195
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,840
So it sounds a little softer but what he's actually really saying is you're doing this.

196
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Right.

197
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,880
So instead of saying you're blaming the tech team he adds this word essentially to kind

198
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,640
of say well basically you're saying it's their fault.

199
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Yeah.

200
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,880
But the context or you understand that it's actually very direct and he's saying it's

201
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
your fault.

202
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Yeah.

203
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,120
So he's he's he's saying you're almost blaming the tech team but what he means is you're

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
blaming the tech team.

205
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,880
Now our third phrase is very interesting because it's kind of like a saying.

206
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
That's right.

207
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,040
So the employee says I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

208
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

209
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm not trying to pass the buck.

210
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,240
Now what's the buck.

211
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
A dollar bill.

212
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,480
A dollar bill.

213
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,400
So he's well I understand that he's saying I'm not trying to blame somebody else or pass

214
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,040
the blame on to someone else.

215
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
But you can think about it like this.

216
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,640
Like imagine he had some fake or phony money right.

217
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,160
And he wants to pass that on to the next person so he doesn't get in trouble.

218
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
OK.

219
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,280
So I'm not trying to pass the buck.

220
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm not trying to pass the blame put the responsibility on someone else.

221
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Very good.

222
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,000
But you know what you know what he really means here.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
What I am trying to do that because he knew.

224
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
He knew that it was a fake dollar bill.

225
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Yeah.

226
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Yeah.

227
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah.

228
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,720
And this is interesting as well because it's kind of like a metaphor.

229
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,340
He said the boss said you're using the small technical glitches as a crutch.

230
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,680
So using something as a crutch.

231
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,400
Now the crutch is a you know when you when you break your leg you use those wooden or

232
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,720
metal sticks to walk with.

233
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
OK to help you walk.

234
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Yeah.

235
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,340
So the boss is basically saying you're using these technical glitches as an excuse or as

236
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,400
an aid to why you missed the deadline.

237
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah.

238
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,360
So if you think about it like this some people might say OK if you walk with a crutch then

239
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
you you won't succeed.

240
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Right.

241
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,760
Because whatever.

242
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,600
So this guy this employee is basically saying yes I know that I should meet deadlines but

243
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,080
these these problems these glitches are like my crutch that make me not succeed.

244
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
OK.

245
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,520
So he's trying to just make excuses.

246
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,720
So God Marco that is a little bit difficult to understand.

247
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,120
Do you think we should give a couple more examples.

248
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,440
Yeah I think I think some more examples would be very useful.

249
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,160
So let's listen to a couple of them now.

250
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,680
Example one.

251
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,720
I realized that I was using alcohol as a crutch to get through the day.

252
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,920
Example two.

253
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,760
I think Bill's very capable of being successful but he uses his disability as a crutch example

254
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,600
three.

255
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,960
Stop using your weight as a crutch just because you're a bit fat doesn't mean you can't get

256
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,480
a great job.

257
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
All right.

258
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,600
So a lot of great phrases great words and well I think it's time for us to listen to

259
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,240
this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about this aspect of meeting

260
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:08,160
deadlines.

261
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,080
And so I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

262
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,500
As you know you've missed a fairly significant deadline last week and this will negatively

263
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,360
impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.

264
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,160
I know I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline but really it wasn't my fault.

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,040
You see we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute and I couldn't

266
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,160
get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data

267
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
analysis.

268
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,720
You know if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable then I wouldn't

269
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,040
have missed my deadline.

270
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,580
Oh come on.

271
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,640
An excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

272
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,240
You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues rather than accepting

273
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,960
responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

274
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,240
No I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

275
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,800
I know it was me who was ultimately responsible for getting this done.

276
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,600
But the thing is I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down.

277
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,120
And you know with everything I've got going on now I can't afford to waste time dealing

278
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
with technical problems.

279
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,040
I've got a lot on my plate and there are only 24 hours in a day.

280
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm not going to accept this excuse.

281
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,840
You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the

282
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,880
fact that you've missed your deadline.

283
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,260
Look we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards.

284
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,360
No more phony excuses.

285
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,760
If you're in over your head you tell me.

286
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,400
No more missed deadlines.

287
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:47,680
Now I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.

288
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,960
This employee got in a lot of trouble for missing his deadline.

289
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Exactly.

290
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:59,520
I think it's a very important aspect of not only Western culture but also in general assuming

291
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,480
guilt when it's your fault.

292
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,240
In this case we saw that the employee didn't really want to accept the fact that it was

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
his fault.

294
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,280
He didn't say yeah I know it was me I'm sorry and this is my plan to fix it.

295
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,520
Now this is very important among cultures because in some cultures the aspect of losing

296
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,640
face is so important right?

297
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Right.

298
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,760
So somebody may not really want to assume guilt or they have to because it's part of

299
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
the culture.

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,000
But what's the standard in North American business practice?

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,360
I would say that you would have to assume responsibility and take responsibility for

302
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,680
your actions right and say yes it's my fault I did it but I'm going to get it fixed or

303
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,200
I'll do it or I'll make up for it.

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,160
So some good business tips here today in this lesson.

305
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,520
Now remember if you have any questions about the language or want to tell us a little bit
