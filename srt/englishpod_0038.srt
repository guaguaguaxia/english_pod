00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,920
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,920
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,920
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,800
And today we're bringing you another great lesson for all of you who are interested in

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
shopping.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
Especially those of you who are interested in shopping for a car.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,140
A car, exactly.

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,580
So we're going to give you some great language about describing a car or characteristics

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,580
of a car.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,580
Yep.

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,200
And also some really interesting language for shopping.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,520
Yes, especially buying something really big and expensive.

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,800
Yeah, like a car.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Yeah.

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,400
So before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,840
On vocabulary preview today, we're bringing you two words.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
The first one is vehicle.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Vehicle.

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
Vehicle.

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Vehicle.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
So, again, a vehicle is a machine, right?

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Right.

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,640
A machine that carries people from one place to another.

26
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,400
So it's important to say that a vehicle could be an airplane.

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
A car.

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
A car.

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
A boat.

30
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
A boat.

31
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,440
Yeah, that's a vehicle.

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Our second word is sedan.

33
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Sedan.

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Sedan.

35
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Sedan.

36
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,920
So a sedan is a type of car.

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Exactly.

38
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,200
It's a type of car with four doors that can fit five people inside.

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
So to make it more clear, most taxis are sedans.

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Exactly.

41
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Right?

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,120
They have four doors, five people can fit in there, including the driver.

43
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,680
Except taxis in Mexico.

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
They're not sedans?

45
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
They're little beetles.

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Oh.

47
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
They're Volkswagen beetles.

48
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Okay.

49
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
So those are not sedans.

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,160
But yeah, most countries have sedans as taxis.

51
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,400
To give you some examples, like a Toyota Corolla or a Toyota Camry is a sedan.

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,960
Maybe like a Volkswagen Jetta.

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Is that a...

55
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
A Jetta, yeah.

56
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
A Jetta is a sedan.

57
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Yeah.

58
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Now we can listen to our dialogue, and it's going to be at a normal speed the first time,

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,920
but you don't have to worry about it.

60
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,680
We'll come back and teach you some of the important words from the dialogue.

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:04,400
Hi there, can I help you folks?

62
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

63
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,360
My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.

64
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,400
Dad, I'm 16 already, and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
She's right, you know.

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Kids these days all have cars.

67
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,920
Let me show you something we just got in, a 1996 sedan, excellent gas mileage.

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes, a perfect vehicle for a young driver.

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
Dad, I love it.

70
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
It's awesome.

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
Can we get this one, please?

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,720
I see.

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
What can you tell me about this one?

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,840
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we used for TV commercials.

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Now about this sedan...

76
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,520
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

77
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,560
Tell me more about this tank.

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,280
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

79
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,560
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

80
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,680
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

81
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
It does not.

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,320
Well, I don't know.

83
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,560
Let me sleep on it.

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
I'll take it.

86
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Dad!

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I think she's really lucky.

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Really?

89
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,200
She's getting a tank to go to school.

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
How awesome is that?

91
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,840
I would be so embarrassed if I had to drive to school in a tank.

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
It's like the coolest car.

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,200
Oh, you're such a boy.

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,080
All right, a surprising ending to a relatively easy shopping day.

95
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Yeah.

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,240
Let's take a look at some language that we saw in our dialogue on Language Takeaway.

97
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,560
Language Takeaway.

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,960
We have four words for you today.

99
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,000
The first one is gas mileage.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Gas mileage.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
Gas mileage.

102
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Gas mileage.

103
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,880
So gas mileage is how many miles you can travel on a gallon or liter of gasoline.

104
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,200
Well, you know what's interesting?

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,440
In some English-speaking countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, we use kilometers to

106
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,520
measure distance, but we still talk about gas mileage.

107
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Yeah.

108
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,520
I guess you can't say gas kilomileage.

109
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
No.

110
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,440
Or something like that.

111
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,080
But yeah, it's basically how many kilometers or how many miles you can travel on a tank

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
or on a liter or gallon of gas.

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Exactly.

114
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Okay.

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
The next word is airbags.

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Airbags.

117
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Airbags.

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Airbags.

119
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,600
These are like big bags of air that fill up and come out of the car when there's a crash.

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Right.

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,960
So that way you don't hit your head against the steering wheel or something like that.

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
So they protect you.

123
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Right.

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
I've heard that Volvo has like 18 airbags now in their cars.

125
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,360
They are very safe cars, you know.

126
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Like a big balloon.

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Okay.

128
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,400
Our third word today is brakes.

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Brakes.

130
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Brakes.

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Brakes.

132
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,080
So what are brakes?

133
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,640
Brakes are little...

134
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
What are brakes?

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,480
Brakes are what make your car stop.

136
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Okay.

137
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,680
So they're the little machines maybe that stop your car?

138
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah.

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
They're on the wheels.

140
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Yeah.

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
They make your car stop.

142
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
You have brakes on your bike.

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Yes.

144
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
On your car, etc.

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Mm-hmm.

146
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,120
Our last word today on Language Takeaway, reinforced.

147
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Reinforced.

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Reinforced.

149
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Reinforced.

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,080
So we have some examples of how we use reinforced because it's a little bit weird.

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Yeah.

152
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,200
These will help you understand the meaning.

153
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Example one.

154
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,320
So I reinforced all the walls.

155
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:51,400
There's no way they're going to fall down.

156
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,340
Example two.

157
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:05,600
This plastic is reinforced with glass, so it's both light and strong.

158
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,920
So basically anything that's reinforced is made stronger.

159
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Perfect.

160
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,200
Reinforced steel, reinforced table, anything.

161
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Okay.

162
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Great.

163
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,660
So now we can listen to our dialogue again.

164
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:25,280
You can practice all these words that we just talked about and we'll come back shortly.

165
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
Hi there.

166
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,640
Can I help you folks?

167
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,720
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

169
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,280
You know how it is.

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,760
Dad, I'm 16 already and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

171
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,840
She is right, you know.

172
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,720
Kids these days all have cars.

173
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,840
Let me show you something we just got in.

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,800
A 1996 sedan.

175
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,840
Excellent gas mileage.

176
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,960
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.

177
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,640
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

178
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,760
Dad, I love it.

179
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,320
It's awesome.

180
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,080
Can we get this one, please?

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,920
I see.

182
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,440
What can you tell me about this one?

183
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,640
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

184
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,800
Now about this sedan.

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,040
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

186
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,600
Tell me more about this tank.

187
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

188
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,680
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

189
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
It does not.

191
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,200
Well, I don't know.

192
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,960
Let me sleep on it.

193
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,160
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

194
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,360
I'll take it.

195
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,560
Dad.

196
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,600
So we have a couple of interesting phrases to talk about shopping.

197
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Right.

198
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,760
Let's look at these in Fluency Builder.

199
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,140
Fluency Builder.

200
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,400
The first one today is, I'm just browsing.

201
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm just browsing.

202
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm just browsing.

203
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm just browsing.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,040
This is a really useful phrase because usually salespeople will come up to you and ask you,

205
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
can I help you?

206
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Are you interested in something?

207
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Yeah.

208
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
And you're just looking.

209
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,560
Yeah, you maybe don't really want to buy today.

210
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Right.

211
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,240
So you're just, I'm just browsing.

212
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,000
So then they'll just leave you alone.

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
Yeah, they won't bother you as much.

214
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,680
Yeah, it's a good, good phrase.

215
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,880
Another good phrase.

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Sleep on it.

217
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Sleep on it.

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Sleep on it.

219
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,320
Sleep on it.

220
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,600
So we have some examples of how we use sleep on it.

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
Example one.

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,120
I don't know if we should buy that house.

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,680
It's perfect for us, but it's so expensive.

224
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,240
Let's sleep on it.

225
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,720
Example two.

226
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:28,360
Why don't you sleep on it and tell me tomorrow?

227
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,840
Example three.

228
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,920
This is a bit more than what I can afford.

229
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,080
Let me sleep on it.

230
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
To sleep on it means to...

231
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,880
Like to think about it overnight.

232
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
To think about it.

233
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Yeah.

234
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Right.

235
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,840
So maybe you want to buy this really expensive car.

236
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
But you need to think about it.

237
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Right.

238
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
So you'll sleep on it.

239
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
So yeah.

240
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,280
You go home, sleep on it, think about it twice, and then make a decision.

241
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Exactly.

242
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,680
Okay, great words and great dialogue.

243
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,280
Yeah, I love this dialogue.

244
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

245
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:12,920
So we could listen to it again, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about it.

246
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:23,240
Hi there, can I help you folks?

247
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

248
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,960
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

249
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
You know how it is.

250
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,240
Dad, I'm 16 already, and I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

251
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
She's right, you know.

252
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,080
Kids these days all have cars.

253
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,280
Let me show you something we just got in.

254
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,680
A 1996 sedan.

255
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,760
Excellent gas mileage.

256
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,840
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.

257
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

258
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,320
Dad, I love it.

259
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
It's awesome.

260
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,200
Can we get this one, please?

261
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
I see.

262
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,960
What can you tell me about this one?

263
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,720
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we used for TV commercials.

264
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Now about this sedan.

265
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,360
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

266
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Tell me more about this tank.

267
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,160
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

268
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,440
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

269
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,560
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

270
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
It does not.

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,200
Well, I don't know.

272
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,440
Let me sleep on it.

273
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

274
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I'll take it.

275
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,840
Dad!

276
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:38,480
So, Marco, have you ever driven a tank?

277
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
I mean, I know you're in the Army.

278
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,480
Yeah, actually I did.

279
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,840
I did drive a tank before.

280
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Really?

281
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah, really old one.

282
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Kind of like a World War II type tank.

283
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,520
But yeah, they're really fun and interesting.

284
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,000
It's not like driving a normal car.

285
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You have pedals.

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,360
So there's no steering wheel?

287
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
No, no, no.

288
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,480
You have levers.

289
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,520
And what many people don't know is that actually tanks are manual transmissions.

290
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,680
You have to change gears.

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Oh, really?

292
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,280
And it's really hard to change gears on those things.

293
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,960
And what's the gas mileage like in a tank?

294
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
I don't know.

295
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,040
Maybe like five miles per gallon.

296
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,080
They run on diesel, which is a different type of fuel, right?

297
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Yeah.

298
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Okay, well, very cool.

299
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,280
I never knew that my podcast partner had driven a tank.

300
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
That's pretty awesome.

301
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Yeah, well, it was fun, definitely.

302
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,560
And I hope I get to do it again someday.

303
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
All right.

304
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,080
Well, guys, have you ever driven a tank?

305
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Or a submarine or any type of armored vehicle?

306
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah.

307
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
You can find out more about it at our website, EnglishPod.com.

308
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Right.

309
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,040
We'll be there to answer all your questions.

310
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,320
I'll also be there to maybe post some more crazy stories.

311
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
Or some pictures of a tank.

312
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Yeah, maybe.

313
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Yeah.

314
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
All right, guys.

315
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
We'll see you there.

316
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Until then, it's goodbye.

317
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:10,680
Cheers.
