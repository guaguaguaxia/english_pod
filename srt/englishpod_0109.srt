00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello English learners, welcome back to another show with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,320
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,640
And today we're bringing you another romantic lesson but a little bit sad as well.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,640
That's right.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,280
Today, unfortunately, our couple is going to be breaking up.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,920
Right, so it's a little bit sad today but it's going to be good because we're going

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,840
to be teaching you some great words and phrases that you can use when you are faced in this

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
situation.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,520
Right, and so we're going to learn some phrases for breaking up and also some phrases for

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
staying together.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,120
Alright, so let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and see what happens with our

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,120
young couple.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:59,560
Honey, do you have a second?

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Sure.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Are you okay?

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
You seem a bit worried.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,440
What's on your mind?

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
We need to talk.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Okay.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,400
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
What?

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Why?

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we're

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
happy together, aren't we?

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,160
That's just it.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,720
It's not you, it's me.

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,140
I know that I can be hard to deal with and you're a great guy.

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,800
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,720
So what are you saying?

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,040
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,440
Tim, you are too good for me.

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,280
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
happy.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,280
I could say that I'll be all you need but that'd be a lie.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,860
I know I'd only hurt you.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,800
I know I'd only make you cry.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,680
Baby, come on.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't do this to me.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,720
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,040
Just give me another chance.

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,920
I know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together.

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Don't leave me.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
I can't, Tim.

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,240
I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.

47
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,440
I don't really want to go but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Laura.

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,640
Here are your keys.

50
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,560
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm sorry, Tim.

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,440
I wish you all the best and I hope that one day we can meet again.

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:42,520
I'll always love you.

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:52,500
Goodbye.

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,720
Okay so a pretty sad ending to this relationship, isn't it?

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,240
Yeah, but I don't think the girl was very moved or very sad by breaking up with him.

57
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,640
I wonder why.

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,160
Maybe she's got some other boyfriend somewhere else.

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Maybe.

60
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,520
Well, as you mentioned, we listened to some great phrases and it's time for us to take

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,320
a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Fluency Builder.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay, here we're going to focus on phrases that people use when they break up.

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,720
So maybe you've heard these in movies and we're going to look at the meaning now.

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,020
Alright, our first phrase, as we heard, she started by saying, we need to talk.

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,240
We need to talk.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,740
Alright, so it's a very direct sentence, we need to talk.

68
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,160
So when you tell someone, we need to talk, you're telling them that you want to talk

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,040
about a serious thing, right?

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,440
Right, so if somebody tells you, we need to talk, you know that you're going to talk about

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,480
a very serious matter.

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,360
Yeah, a problem or a breakup or something.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,820
And after that, she told him that they should start seeing other people.

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,560
Start seeing other people.

75
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Okay, I think we need to start seeing other people.

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
To see other people.

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,120
Alright, so this is very easy to understand.

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
It means to?

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,320
To date other people.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Okay, so it basically means that you will break up.

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,960
It's an indirect way of saying that, right?

82
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,040
Yeah, you're not saying, hey, let's stop dating.

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,240
You're saying, oh, well, maybe we should date other people and kind of giving the idea that

84
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,400
you will still date each other, but everyone knows you won't.

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,120
Alright, so let's start seeing other people.

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,640
Now for our third phrase.

87
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,960
She says, it's not you, it's me.

88
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
It's not you, it's me.

89
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
It's not you, it's me.

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,960
Now this is a very cliche phrase and you hear it all the time in movies and well, some people

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,840
still use it, right?

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Everyone says this.

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I've heard this.

94
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I've said this.

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Okay.

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,920
It means basically, I'm the problem.

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
You're not the problem.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm the problem.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,480
Right, so I am breaking up with you because it's my fault, not your fault.

100
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,960
Yeah, so it's kind of a nice way to break up with someone, but actually everyone knows

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
that it's kind of a lie.

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Not true, right?

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It is you.

104
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
You are the problem.

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Alright, so it's not you, it's me.

106
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,800
And then, well, in order to emphasize this, that it's not his fault, she said that I know

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,940
I'm hard to deal with.

108
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,000
So hard to deal with.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,240
Okay, if somebody is hard to deal with.

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,760
They're maybe difficult to talk to, difficult to please, maybe difficult to manage.

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,840
Okay, so it's very difficult to talk to that person.

112
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,060
Alright, hard to deal with.

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
It's only for people.

114
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,320
You can't use it for a situation or something else?

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,760
No, you can use it for people or situations or even sometimes things.

116
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,880
So for example, I can say, I find this problem at work so hard to deal with.

117
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, hard to deal with.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,440
So we've seen these four phrases that we can use to break up with someone.

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
And well, let's listen to our dialogue again.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some other

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,440
phrases to stay together with someone.

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,840
Honey, do you have a second?

123
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Sure.

124
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Are you okay?

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
You seem a bit worried.

126
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,760
What's on your mind?

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760
We need to talk.

128
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,960
Okay.

129
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,640
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
What?

131
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Why?

132
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,520
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,640
happy together, aren't we?

134
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,920
That's just it.

135
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,120
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

136
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
It's not you.

137
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,640
It's me.

138
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,040
I know that I can be hard to deal with and you're a great guy.

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,680
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,600
So what are you saying?

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,920
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

142
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,360
Tim, you are too good for me.

143
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,240
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me

144
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
happy.

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

146
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,760
I know I'd only hurt you.

147
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,720
I know I'd only make you cry.

148
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Baby, come on.

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,280
Don't do this to me.

150
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,600
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
Just give me another chance.

152
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,840
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,480
Don't leave me.

154
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,160
I can't, Tim.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.

156
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,800
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
do.

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Laura.

159
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Here are your keys.

160
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

161
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry, Tim.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,320
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,840
I'll always love you.

164
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
Goodbye.

165
00:07:51,520 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay, so as you said, we're now going to focus on the phrases you use to stay in a relationship

166
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
with someone.

167
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,480
So let's look at those now in the Fluency Builder Part Two.

168
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,920
Fluency Builder.

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,120
So the girl was trying to break up with him, and he kept on trying to convince her to stay.

170
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
That's right.

171
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,160
And one of the things he said was, we've had our ups and downs.

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,200
We've had our ups and downs.

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Ups and downs.

174
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,280
Well, ups and downs are good times and bad times.

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Right.

176
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,720
So the good times would be the ups and the bad times.

177
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Obviously the downs.

178
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
All right.

179
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
So it's an informal way of saying good times, bad times.

180
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,480
So they've had their ups and downs, and he said we can work it out.

181
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
We can work it out.

182
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,280
So whatever the problem is, we can work it out.

183
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,520
So why don't we hear some examples of how this phrase is used, and that will help us

184
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,400
understand it a bit better.

185
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,440
Example one.

186
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,560
Peter and Claudia were having some problems, but they finally worked out their personal

187
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,360
differences.

188
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,560
Example two.

189
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,680
We need to work out a new marketing plan for this upcoming quarter.

190
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,480
Example three.

191
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,000
After an hour, I finally worked out the answer to this math problem.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Okay, so to work something out means to find a solution for it.

193
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
Yeah, to solve the problem.

194
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,640
To solve the problem.

195
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,160
And again, he kept on insisting and saying, well, we can get through this.

196
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,120
We can get through this.

197
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, get through this.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,560
So to get through something.

199
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,040
What does it mean to get through something?

200
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Well, basically to survive a difficult situation.

201
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Alright.

202
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,960
Or live through a difficult time.

203
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,840
Okay, so for them, the difficult time was this in their relationship.

204
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,920
Yeah, or maybe you're having a problem at work, and you might say, hey guys, don't worry.

205
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,640
We can get through this.

206
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
Just give us one more week.

207
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
Okay, very good.

208
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,960
And well, as he was saying that they can get through this, he mentioned that they have

209
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,840
to stick together.

210
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,640
To stick together.

211
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
We gotta stick together.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
Stick together.

213
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,400
So again, to stick.

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,360
So when something sticks together, it stays together like glue.

215
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Right, so they have to be a team and not separate in order to solve their problems.

216
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,080
Exactly, it gives you that idea that they're gonna work together and stay together.

217
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,720
Okay, very good.

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,080
So let's stick together.

219
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,880
Alright so again, we have four great phrases to convince somebody or to say that you want

220
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
to stay together in a relationship, right?

221
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
That's right.

222
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:56,480
I think it'll help us to understand these if we hear them one more time in the dialogue.

223
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Honey do you have a second?

224
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Sure.

225
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Are you okay?

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
You seem a bit worried.

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,400
What's on your mind?

228
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,160
We need to talk.

229
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,600
Okay.

230
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,360
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

231
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
What?

232
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Why?

233
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,160
I mean we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement but we're

234
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,840
happy together, aren't we?

235
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,120
That's just it.

236
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,160
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

237
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,680
It's not you, it's me.

238
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,080
I know that I can be hard to deal with and you're a great guy.

239
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,760
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

240
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,680
So what are you saying?

241
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,000
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,440
Tim, you are too good for me.

243
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,240
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me

244
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
happy.

245
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
I could say that I'll be all you need but that'd be a lie.

246
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,800
I know I'd only hurt you.

247
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,760
I know I'd only make you cry.

248
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,600
Baby, come on.

249
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't do this to me.

250
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,640
Whatever it is we can work it out.

251
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,960
Just give me another chance.

252
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,880
I know that we can get through this but we gotta stick together.

253
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,520
Don't leave me.

254
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,240
I can't, Tim.

255
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,200
I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.

256
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,240
I don't really want to go but deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.

257
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Laura.

258
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,560
Here are your keys.

259
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,520
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

260
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm sorry, Tim.

261
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,400
I wish you all the best and I hope that one day we can meet again.

262
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,960
I'll always love you.

263
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Goodbye.

264
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,960
I know I'd only hurt you.

265
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I know I'd only make you cry.

266
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm not the one you needed.

267
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I love you.

268
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Goodbye.

269
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:57,560
Alright, so breaking up can be a difficult situation, especially if you're the one breaking

270
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
up, right?

271
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,480
Well, I guess it's never happy if you're the person who's being broken up with or you're

272
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,320
the person doing the breaking up.

273
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
But you know what?

274
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,080
I really noticed that a lot of the phrases the girl used to break up were very like cliche,

275
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
like you said.

276
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
They were very...

277
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Common.

278
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Too common.

279
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
And kind of a joke almost.

280
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,760
So the phrase, it's not you, it's me, it's one of them.

281
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Yeah.

282
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
And she also said you deserve better.

283
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,840
You deserve someone better.

284
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Yeah.

285
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,200
That's a very common one saying like, I'm not good enough for you.

286
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Yeah.

287
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,160
But again, it kind of just, it loses its meaning, doesn't it?

288
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,200
And also another phrase that's very cliche, but it wasn't in our dialogue was maybe the

289
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,920
timing is just not right.

290
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Yeah.

291
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
People say that all the time.

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Yeah.

293
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
So they say, no, the timing is not right.

294
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,080
It's not the appropriate time to be together.

295
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah.

296
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,360
That's just an excuse for not wanting to date that special person.

297
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Exactly.

298
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,940
So it can be a difficult situation and people do it every day through letters, sometimes

299
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
through the phone.

300
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
Yeah.

301
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,720
And sometimes it's just breaking up in person.

302
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,280
So listeners, why don't you tell us if you have any stories of breaking up with someone

303
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,680
or maybe somebody broke up with you.

304
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
That's right.

305
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,560
Try and use the language in this lesson and visit us on our website at EnglishPod.com

306
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
and leave us a comment.

307
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
All right.

308
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,600
We'll see you guys there and until next time.

309
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Thanks for listening and goodbye.

310
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:26,840
Goodbye.
