00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,440
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,280
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about sports, part of our sports series.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
That's right.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,200
And in this lesson, we are talking about maybe the world's most favorite sport.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Right.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,000
One of the most popular sports in the world, soccer.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,320
Or also known as football in other countries.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Yes.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,840
So, before we get started with this great lesson, let's take a look at some of the words

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
we'll find in the dialogue in Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,340
We're going to look at three words here.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,720
The first word is wingman.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Wingman.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
A wingman.

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Now, wingman isn't really related to soccer in any way.

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
Okay.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,500
But it's a way of referring to somebody as your right hand.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,080
So your helper.

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,280
Your helper.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,760
Your number one guy.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Okay.

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Right.

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,880
So a wingman is someone who helps you a lot.

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Exactly.

29
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Okay.

30
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Our next word, tied.

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,360
Tied.

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,080
They are tied.

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
They are tied.

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:18,360
Now, this is an interesting word because tie can be a noun, verb, and an adjective, right?

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Exactly.

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,900
So in this case, they are tied.

37
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,880
It's an adjective meaning...

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,440
They have the same score.

39
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Okay.

40
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,520
So a tie is...

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,080
Is a game that has ended with no winner or loser.

42
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,600
Both of them had the same score.

43
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Exactly.

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,520
And so obviously, the verb to tie is to reach the same score as your other team.

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Exactly.

46
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
All right.

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,920
Well, our third word can also be used as a noun and a verb and it is foul.

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Fouled.

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Fouled.

50
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Okay.

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,760
So, to foul somebody is to do something to them that is not allowed in the sport.

52
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,880
Okay.

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
And so when you do this, you have committed a foul.

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Exactly.

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay.

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
So you use it in the same way, to foul or a foul.

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Interesting.

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,160
Well, we're going to hear these three words in context now.

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:29,880
So why don't we listen to our soccer dialogue?

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
Welcome back, soccer fans.

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,160
My name is Rick Fields.

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,680
And as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman, Bob Copeland.

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,340
And we're in the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1.

64
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,520
As we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
The ref calls the players for the kickoff.

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,720
And here we go.

67
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield.

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,440
But oh, it's out of bounds.

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
That'll be a throw in for Brazil.

70
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,980
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robinho.

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,760
And the ref has called him offside.

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,800
No question about it.

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,640
He was offside by a mile.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Edison Mendes heads it to Valencia.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He shoots.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Deflected by the defender.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,840
And we have a corner kick.

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
Delgado takes the corner.

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
We have a foul.

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh no.

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Dida, the goalkeeper, has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
He gets a yellow card.

84
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,120
And that will be a penalty kick.

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,640
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
champions.

87
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,880
He gets ready for the kick.

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
He shoots.

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
And he...

90
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:45,240
OK, so Ecuador tied with Brazil in the 2022 World Cup.

91
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,760
Wow, Marco, I'm really happy to see that you are able to see so far into the future.

92
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,080
Well, I called it.

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,440
So in 2022, if we do win the World Cup, you know who said it first.

94
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
All right.

95
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Do you have money on that?

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Yes.

97
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
All right.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,120
So apart from this, we saw some really great vocabulary in this lesson.

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,840
So let's take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Language Takeaway.

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
All right.

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,600
We've got a lot of soccer words for you, but they're all important.

103
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
So let's take a look at the first one.

104
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Kick off.

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Kick off.

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Kick off.

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
So a kick off.

108
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
This is how you start a soccer game, right?

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Right.

110
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,240
So in the beginning, the referee blows the whistle and you kick the ball to another player.

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
That's the kick off.

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
OK.

113
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,560
So our next phrase, out of bounds.

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
Out of bounds.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Out of bounds.

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
OK.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Out of bounds.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,840
This is a great word.

119
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,960
So in soccer, when the ball goes out of bounds, it goes outside the white lines, right?

120
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Right.

121
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Outside of the playing field.

122
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
OK.

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
And you can use it in all other sports.

124
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,120
You can use it in basketball.

125
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,160
You can use it in tennis.

126
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
Or football or anything.

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Right.

128
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,560
So any part that is not for playing.

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Out of bounds.

130
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
What's our next word?

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,760
Throw in.

132
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
A throw in.

133
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
A throw in.

134
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
OK.

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
So a throw in.

136
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,240
The ball goes out of bounds.

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
How do you put it back into play?

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Obviously, a throw in.

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
OK.

140
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
So you throw in the ball.

141
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,760
That's the only time where a soccer player will actually grab the ball with his hands.

142
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
All right.

143
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Now, another soccer term we have here, offside.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Offside.

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
OK.

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,720
So this is a little bit difficult to explain.

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,040
But just imagine you're on the soccer field.

148
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,480
And you are trying to score a goal.

149
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,280
Now, you have some defenders, right?

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Right.

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,880
Those are the people who are trying to take the ball away.

152
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,880
And you pass the ball to somebody who is behind the defenders.

153
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,600
Oh, and that person is offside.

154
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Exactly.

155
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,240
So, you must be at all times in the same position as the defenders or in front of them.

156
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,120
But you can't be all the way in the back.

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
OK.

158
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,200
So is this a noun or a verb or an adjective?

159
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
So this is an adjective.

160
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,640
He is offside.

161
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
That's his condition.

162
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
OK.

163
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Great.

164
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Excellent explanation, Marco.

165
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Thank you.

166
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
All right.

167
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,840
Now, we're going to look at three different phrases for three types of kicks in soccer.

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
OK.

169
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,700
So let's take a look at this.

170
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,320
The first one is goal kick.

171
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
A goal kick.

172
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
OK.

173
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Goal kick.

174
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,840
So who does the goal kick?

175
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,480
It's usually the goalie or the goalkeeper who takes the goal kick.

176
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
OK.

177
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,880
So when the goalie kicks the ball.

178
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Mm-hmm.

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,160
Now, what about a corner kick?

180
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
OK.

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:44,320
So if the team is attacking and the ball goes out of bounds in the back area near the goal,

182
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
then they get a corner kick.

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
They've got to kick the ball from the corner of the field.

184
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
This is a great chance to score a goal, isn't it?

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Exactly.

186
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Yes.

187
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
OK.

188
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,360
And what about a penalty kick?

189
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Penalty kick.

190
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Penalty kick.

191
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,520
So if a player gets fouled while he is in the area near the goal, he gets a penalty

192
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
kick.

193
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
So basically, it's just him.

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,680
I think it's 13 or 15 steps away from the goalie and he gets the opportunity to score

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,940
or to kick the ball.

196
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,720
So there are no defenders or other players in the way.

197
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Nobody.

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Wow.

199
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Another great chance to score a goal.

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Right.

201
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
All right.

202
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Well, these are all great soccer words.

203
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,520
I think we should hear them again in context.

204
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,560
So let's listen this time a little bit slower.

205
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,480
Welcome back, soccer fans.

206
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,320
My name is Rick Fields.

207
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,760
And as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman, Bob Copeland.

208
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:54,040
And we're on the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin

209
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,960
the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

210
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,240
The ref calls the players for the kickoff.

211
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,400
And here we go.

212
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield.

213
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,800
But oh, it's out of bounds.

214
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,000
That will be a throw in for Brazil.

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,960
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Rubinho.

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,400
And the ref has called him offside.

217
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,080
No question about it.

218
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,540
He was offside by a mile.

219
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,740
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

220
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,560
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia.

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
He shoots.

222
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,600
Deflected by the defender.

223
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,000
And we have a corner kick.

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Delgado takes the corner.

225
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
We have a foul.

226
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,640
Oh, no.

227
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,960
Dida, the goalkeeper, has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

228
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,640
He gets a yellow card.

229
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,100
And that will be a penalty kick.

230
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,800
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world

231
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,960
champions.

232
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
He gets ready for the kick.

233
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
He shoots.

234
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
And he...

235
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,320
All right.

236
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,240
So we heard these words that we were talking about in context.

237
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,440
And now, some really interesting phrases came up.

238
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,360
And this would be a good time to take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

239
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Fluency Builder.

240
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,200
Well, Marco, there are three great phrases in this dialogue that I want to look at.

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,720
The first one, on the brink of.

242
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,080
We are on the brink of.

243
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
We're on the brink of soccer history.

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Okay.

245
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
So, on the brink of.

246
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,480
What exactly does that mean?

247
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,720
Well, why don't we hear some examples to help us understand the meaning.

248
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
Example one.

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,800
Look, we don't have any money.

250
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,440
We're on the brink of going bankrupt.

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,840
Example two.

252
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
The two countries are on the brink of war.

253
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,400
Example three.

254
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
We're on the brink of an important discovery.

255
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,520
All right.

256
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,560
So great examples, on the brink of, at a critical point.

257
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Exactly.

258
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,600
It means you're almost there, right?

259
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Okay.

260
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Yeah.

261
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Very good.

262
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,240
And what about this next phrase that I saw and it was really interesting.

263
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
No question about it.

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,440
No question about it.

265
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
No question about it.

266
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,920
No question about it.

267
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
All right.

268
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,180
So, this is a statement that doesn't really make much sense.

269
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,920
But what am I saying when I say, oh, no question about it?

270
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,740
You're saying, I agree.

271
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,000
There is no doubt.

272
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're right.

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're right.

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay.

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, let's give some examples.

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,800
I could say, there's no question about it.

277
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,320
Ecuador is a great soccer team.

278
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,120
There is no question about that.

279
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
All right.

280
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
So, or you can say, no question about it.

281
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,320
Our company makes the best products on the market.

282
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Okay.

283
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,640
So, really useful phrase that you can use in sports or anywhere else.

284
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Okay.

285
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,380
And now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

286
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,320
And it's a really good one to exaggerate a little bit.

287
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Okay.

288
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
By a mile.

289
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,520
By a mile.

290
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
By a mile.

291
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,520
So, he was offside by a mile.

292
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Right.

293
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,920
So, the commentator is saying that he was very offside.

294
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
That it was really obvious.

295
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Right.

296
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,160
So, you can use that also in different contexts, maybe not in sports.

297
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Okay.

298
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,400
So, maybe we can say, our company is ahead of all the others by a mile.

299
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Right.

300
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,360
Or if you tell somebody to guess your age and they say, oh, I think you are 42.

301
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Oh, you could say, you're off by a mile.

302
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Right.

303
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
So, you're really, really wrong.

304
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Right.

305
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Exactly.

306
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Yeah.

307
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
So, it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

308
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Yes.

309
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
And saying it's really obvious.

310
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Right.

311
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Well, three awesome phrases.

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,920
And I think it will help us to hear them one more time.

313
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,200
So, let's listen to the dialogue.

314
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:10,560
Welcome back, soccer fans.

315
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
My name is Rick Fields.

316
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,280
And as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman, Bob Copeland.

317
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,280
And we're in the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin

318
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,120
the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

319
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,320
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

320
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield.

321
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,040
But oh, it's out of bounds.

322
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
That'll be a throw in for Brazil.

323
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,600
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Ruigno.

324
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,360
And the ref has called him offside.

325
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,400
No question about it.

326
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,240
He was offside by a mile.

327
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,920
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

328
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,640
Edison Mendes heads it to Valencia.

329
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
He shoots.

330
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,920
Deflected by the defender.

331
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,320
And we have a corner kick.

332
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,900
Delgado takes the corner.

333
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
We have a foul.

334
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Oh, no.

335
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,640
Dida, the goalkeeper, has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

336
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,720
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world

338
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
champions.

339
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,480
He gets ready for the kick.

340
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:20,080
He shoots and he...

341
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,400
Okay well, as you all may know, soccer is a very popular sport, especially in Latin

342
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
America.

343
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
That's right.

344
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,240
And your favorite team, Ecuador, are they really this good in soccer?

345
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,920
Are they really going to win the 2022 Cup?

346
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
Well, maybe not.

347
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,960
Well, actually Ecuador has improved with time, but usually it's the strong teams like Argentina

348
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,360
and Brazil who dominate the region, right?

349
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Right.

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,880
But yeah, hopefully we'll make it next time.

351
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
Okay, well, I have my money on Ecuador.

352
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
For 2022.

353
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,880
But yeah, not on Canada.

354
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,120
There's no hope for us.

355
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
Well, Canada is doing really well now.

356
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,960
They actually beat Mexico, if I'm not mistaken.

357
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Oh, actually that's sort of...

358
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Yeah, I kind of remember that now.

359
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,080
But I think there's no hope for us to beat Brazil or Argentina, one of these big countries.

360
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,640
We have the next World Cup coming up, so it's really exciting and I don't know who's going

361
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
to win.

362
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
All right.

363
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, listeners, who do you think is going to win?

364
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,480
Who is the best soccer team out there?

365
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Right.

366
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,120

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Or from China is for that.

371
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,640
