00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,560
My name is Catherine and it's the holiday season, Marco.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,260
People are eating large meals with their families and I think oftentimes when you cook a lot

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,360
of food, you have something extra at the end.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
What do we call that?

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
That's right.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we're going to talk about leftovers.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's the extra food after your meal that you eat later, maybe the next day.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,080
So, you know, during Christmas or during some holidays, we cook so much food that obviously

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,660
we can't eat it all.

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,080
So we put it back in the refrigerator and then we eat it later.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
So those are called leftovers.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
All right.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's listen to this dialogue about leftovers and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,720
happening in the dialogue.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,640
What's for dinner?

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Leftovers.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
What?

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,400
Leftovers of what and from when?

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
From last night.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,080
I took the leftover turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, add a little

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,480
bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,600
Isn't that dangerous though?

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,200
I mean, bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,760
Well, I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,120
soon after we finished eating.

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,680
Also when reheating, I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,220
Well, okay.

31
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm just afraid of getting food poisoning.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Don't worry about it.

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,840
Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
to eat.

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
All right.

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,080
So a lot of vocab there.

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,280
Let's take a look at it in Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
All right.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,640
So Marco, there's one cooking term really in this dialogue that is, it's a little bit

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
different from the others.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,040
So let's start with that.

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,520
It's diced.

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
That's right.

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,160
We were talking about taking some peppers or diced peppers.

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,520
So when you dice a vegetable or anything that you're cooking, basically you're making little

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,560
pieces, little squares almost.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
That's right.

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
So you can cut something many different ways.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,960
You can cut big pieces and small pieces, but diced peppers, diced is a specific way to

52
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,000
cut something in small, like you say, small squares.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,280
And so in recipes, you will often see this instruction, dice the peppers, or in this

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,640
case, the peppers are diced.

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
That's right.

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
All right.

57
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,560
So we took some turkey, mix it with diced peppers and a lot of things.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,720
And the roommate was a little bit concerned about bacteria and germs.

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
All right.

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,080
So bacteria and germs, these sound like very scientific words.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,120
Bacteria is something that grows on, well, everything really.

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,760
But if you leave food out, for example, it gets bacteria or germs are things that can

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,920
make you sick.

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
That's right.

65
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,760
So we need to avoid these things in the kitchen because they make us unhealthy.

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,320
And that's why we wash our hands and things like that.

67
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,400
But when you have food that's left out, the risk is what, Marco?

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,880
Is that you get bacteria or germs on it.

69
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Yeah.

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,520
So it's dangerous, especially with meat.

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,400
If you leave it out, it's very, very dangerous because you can get some bacteria that will

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
make you sick.

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,120
And the reason why we're a little bit concerned, especially with meats, is if you leave it

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,240
out after cooking it at room temperature.

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
All right.

76
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,760
So room temperature is the temperature of a normal room.

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,360
Maybe it's 65 degrees or what's 25 degrees Celsius.

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,120
It's the temperature of the inside of a room.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
And so it's not cold, it's not hot, it's just normal.

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,680
And when we leave food out, especially meat, like you're saying, we have to be careful.

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,000
You can't leave it out for very long if it's something like eggs or milk or what we call

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
perishables.

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
That's right.

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,440
So actually, here comes the other two words that are a little bit of a contrast.

85
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,320
We're going to talk about food that is reheated or refrigerated.

86
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
All right.

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,040
So the roommate is explaining, don't worry, we have done these things to this food so

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
it's safe.

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,280
So one thing you can do to food to make it safe to kill germs is to reheat it.

90
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,400
That means, well, you know the word heated, right?

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,120
It's to make something hot.

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
How is that different from reheated?

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Well, because you cooked it already, so it was warm.

94
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,000
Now it went a little bit cold because it's at room temperature.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,720
So in order to make sure that it's safe to eat and you kill that bacteria, you reheat

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,160
it so you kind of cook it again a little bit.

97
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah, you cook it again.

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,040
So with leftovers, we often have to reheat things because they were hot, then they were

99
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
cold and now we want them hot again.

100
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
That's right.

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
So we reheat them.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,520
The opposite of that would be refrigerate.

103
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,800
Right, and this is what you should do.

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,120
If you take something and put it in the refrigerator, what you are doing, the verb, the action is

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
to refrigerate it.

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,140
That's right.

107
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,280
So to refrigerate something means to make it cold.

108
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
You know, there are important things that we refrigerate.

109
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,200
We refrigerate eggs, we refrigerate milk, we refrigerate butter.

110
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,520
These are things that can make us sick if we don't make them cold.

111
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Exactly.

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
So those are the two words.

113
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Now obviously, it's a little bit different because the prefix to reheat means to do it

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,760
again while to refrigerate means you're just making it cold.

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Yeah.

116
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,520
Well, they're important terms and again, we also have the adjectives.

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,660
This is reheated or refrigerated.

118
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,680
But there are another couple of phrases that are really important so let's take a listen

119
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,280
to those in Fluency Builder.

120
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Fluency Builder.

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,840
All right, so the first phrase we're going to take a look at is when one of the roommates

122
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,560
says, hey, what's for dinner?

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
What's for dinner?

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,040
All right, this is a very, very standard phrase.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,680
This is something you'll hear at home, you'll hear with your friends.

126
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,560
It's usually something we say that when someone is cooking food for dinner.

127
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
That's right.

128
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,000
We're asking what are we going to eat for dinner?

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,760
Mom, what's for dinner?

130
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Exactly.

131
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,000
I used to say that every single day when I came home from school.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
Well, obviously, you don't want to say the long phrase.

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
What are we going to have for dinner tonight?

134
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
So you just say, what's for dinner?

135
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
What's for dinner?

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,800
And then the answer would be lasagna or turkey sandwiches.

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,560
Right, exactly.

138
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Now when they started talking about the leftover turkey, he was a little bit concerned as we

139
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,160
said about bacteria and germs because it usually happens that you get this on food that was

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
left out.

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,000
All right, so the verb here is to leave out, to leave something out.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It means to leave something or put something at room temperature.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,280
So Marco, you and I are eating turkey, it's Thanksgiving, and we start to have coffee

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,960
and dessert and the turkey is still in the room, at room temperature.

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
We did not refrigerate it.

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
That means it was left out.

147
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
How long was it left out?

148
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
Well, maybe two hours.

149
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,840
That means so it's not in a refrigerator.

150
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
That's right.

151
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
That's exactly what it means.

152
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,200
So maybe you go to sleep and you left the turkey out.

153
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,320
It's still on the table maybe at room temperature.

154
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,080
Oh no, we can't eat it if we left it out for like 12 hours.

155
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Exactly.

156
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,440
All right, so it's not good to leave food out.

157
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,440
And now what happens is if you do eat food that was left out for too long, you could

158
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,480
get food poisoning.

159
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,600
Now this is very serious and it's something that you should be very careful about when

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,840
you're cooking.

161
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,560
Food poisoning is getting sick from your food.

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,440
There are different kinds of food poisoning, but usually it makes you throw up, it makes

163
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,680
your stomach hurt, it's quite painful.

164
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
That's right.

165
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,880
And this is why we say you should wash your hands before you cook.

166
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,640
You should make sure that you refrigerate meat because you want to avoid food poisoning.

167
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
That's right.

168
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,120
And it comes from the noun poison, a poison, which is something that is harmful for your

169
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
body.

170
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
That's right.

171
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,640
There are many different kinds of poison, but food poisoning means becoming sick, your

172
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,600
body getting sick after you eat something bad.

173
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
That's right.

174
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
All right.

175
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:17,760
So with all this stuff here, we can review everything one last time.

176
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
What's for dinner?

177
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Leftovers.

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
What?

179
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,440
Leftovers of what and from when?

180
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
From last night.

181
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,120
I took the leftover turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, add a little

182
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches.

183
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,640
Isn't that dangerous though?

184
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,720
I mean, bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated.

185
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,000
Well I didn't leave the turkey at a room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated soon

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,160
after we finished eating.

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,640
Also when reheating, I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.

188
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
Well, okay.

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
I'm just afraid of getting food poisoning.

190
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Don't worry about it.

191
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,820
Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art.

192
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,280
Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
to eat.

194
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,720
All right, so this is actually good advice about leftovers, about having something to

195
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
eat.

196
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,880
But at the same time, I don't know how many people actually are very careful with these

197
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
things.

198
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
For example, pizza.

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,200
Sometimes you leave pizza out on the table all night and the next morning you have some

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
pizza.

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,080
I always refrigerate my pizza.

202
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,200
I know people who leave their pizza out and then eat it, but there's cheese and sausage

203
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,040
and you want to refrigerate that stuff.

204
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,600
So I always wrap it in plastic and put it on a plate in the fridge.

205
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh, okay.

206
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
You wrap it in plastic.

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,920
Well, because in the refrigerator there's also germs, so you need to make sure you cover

208
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
your food.

209
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,520
Right, right, right.

210
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,680
What about, have you ever had a bad case of food poisoning because of having leftovers?

211
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
No.

212
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,400
I've had food poisoning, but not because of leftovers.

213
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,200
Because as I said before, I wrap things, I put them in the refrigerator.

214
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,160
I'm very careful because I don't want to get sick or I don't want to get other people sick.

215
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,000
But Thanksgiving or Christmas, you have to give food to many other people.

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,640
I don't want to make anyone sick.

217
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,400
And actually, you can get food poisoning not only from leftovers, but from maybe food that

218
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,320
maybe was expired.

219
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,880
Sometimes cheese maybe can be expired, you didn't realize it, and you get food poisoning.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,640
Or from people who are cooking with things that are not clean.

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,240
So you have something that's not clean or food that's not fresh and it makes you very

222
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
sick.

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
So it's not good for your health.

224
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
So you have to be careful.

225
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
That's right.

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,800
So it's an interesting thing, especially with, like I said, so many holidays where you cook

227
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,480
so much food that people have a lot of leftovers.

228
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,840
And not only that, but even at restaurants, maybe you order too much, so you have leftovers

229
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,720
you want to take home to your dog or to have later.

230
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I love leftovers.

231
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,680
Let us know, do you have leftovers in your country?

232
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,320
Are there things that you should and shouldn't do when cooking?

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Let us know.

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320

236
