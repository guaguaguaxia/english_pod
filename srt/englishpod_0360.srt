00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,800
And my name is Catherine. And today we're talking about some very interesting stories.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,800
We're going to learn some words for stories or tales. But specifically, what kind of stories,

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Marco?

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,440
They're popular stories that you hear maybe through emails or maybe in your town there's

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,520
some particular story about maybe a ghost or many different things that they're kind

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,720
of hard to believe but that happened a long time ago and people still talk about today.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
And they're scary.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
Yeah, they're kind of scary.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,160
So let's listen to today's dialogue, hear some interesting stories. And when we come

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:50,000
back, we'll be talking more about what these words and phrases mean.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
What do you mean?

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,440
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,860
organs removed. Then they're sold on the black market.

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,960
Don't tell me you actually believe all that. Don't be so gullible. They are just urban

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,280
legends. They're just stories people make up to scare you.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,960
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,820
if you play them backwards. Can you believe that?

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,220
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,680
subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so naive.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
Well maybe you are right. But how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,480
chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,400
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,900
All right, we're back. So let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,080
Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,360
So here on Language Takeaway today, we have some words that will help us understand the

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,800
dialogue. The first word is drugged. So I was reading about how some people get drugged

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
in their hotel rooms.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,280
That's right. So if you get drugged, it means that someone gave you some drugs in order

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,200
to make you sleepy or in order for you to not remember what happened.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,360
All right. So he was drugged means someone gave him a drug, something that made him go

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
to sleep.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,200
Right. And it's not necessarily always a bad thing because obviously if you go to the hospital,

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,560
the doctor may drug you in order to, you know, so you don't feel so much pain or something.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Exactly. If you're in an accident, you're in a lot of pain, the doctor drugs you so

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,840
you don't feel that pain.

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
That's right.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,080
All right. So he was drugged. This person is drugged. And then what happens?

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,960
Well, his organs were removed.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,520
All right. So organ, an organ is a noun. It's a thing. Those are actually the things that

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
are inside our body.

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Right. So your heart, liver, your pancreas, kidneys, etc.

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,080
These are all organs. And this is basically the category for the part of the body. It's

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
anything really inside your body that has a function.

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Okay. So this is supposedly this story is that people, you know, usually tourists, they

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
get tricked or drugged and then they get their organs removed.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,240
Now what kind of a story is this, Marco? Because it's not just a normal story.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,760
Right. All of these stories that we saw in the dialogue are called urban legends.

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,880
Okay. Urban has to do with cities, right? Legend is a story that may or may not be true.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
That's right.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
It comes from a long time ago.

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,640
So an urban legend is actually a story that is probably not true that you hear from other

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
people like your friends.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,520
That's right. So usually most of these stories fall under this category. You know, they're

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,020
urban legends. You don't really know if they're true, but people say it happened to a friend

57
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,720
of theirs from a long time ago or stuff like that.

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,080
Exactly. So a friend of a friend of a friend of mine told me that in hotels, sometimes

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,520
they take your organs. Well, obviously that's not right.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,960
Right. Right. All right. So after that, we have two great adjectives for describing people

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,920
who like to believe stories like this. What are those two adjectives?

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,880
Well, we have the adjective to be gullible and to be naive.

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,840
All right. So they're a little bit different. To be gullible means to believe everything

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
that people tell you.

65
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,080
Right. So if you're gullible, you pretty much believe anything you see or you hear.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah. So maybe your friend says, did you know Michael Jordan is coming to the office tomorrow?

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,240
Right. And you believe it, then you're very, very gullible.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,800
Very gullible. You believe what people tell you. But naive is similar.

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,640
It's similar, but I guess it has a little bit of a different meaning in the sense that

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,480
you're not, it's not that you're so gullible, but you wholeheartedly trust people. So you're

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,120
naive, you're innocent.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,280
You're innocent. Maybe you don't have a lot of life experience. So you trust people and

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,360
you can call a person naive. You say, well, he's very naive about these kinds of things.

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,640
I guess that's the main key, right? Or the main point is that you don't really have too

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,400
much life experience. So that's why you're naive.

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
That's right. And just be careful because gullible and naive are things that we say

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,800
about people, but they're not nice things. They're not compliments.

78
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,200
Right. So you shouldn't really say it to someone directly like in the dialogue.

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Exactly. Maybe as a joke, but not seriously.

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,160
Okay. So we have the great adjectives way to describe people. And lastly, we also have

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,640
something else that how to describe the situation. Maybe it's too farfetched. It's too difficult

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,680
to believe.

83
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,160
So farfetched, this is a great word. It means basically that something is very difficult

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,960
to believe. Like you say, for example, the story about Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan

85
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,600
is coming tomorrow. You say, oh, that's pretty farfetched. I don't really think that could

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
happen.

87
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,520
Right. So something that is farfetched is difficult to happen or very, very unlikely

88
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
to happen.

89
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Very unlikely.

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,080
Okay. So very good. We saw five key words there. Let's take a break and listen to the

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:03,280
dialogue again.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

93
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
What do you mean?

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,720
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,120
organs removed. Then they're sold on the black market.

96
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Don't tell me you actually believe all that. Don't be so gullible. They are just urban

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
legends. They're just stories people make up to scare you.

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,240
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages

99
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,100
if you play them backwards. Can you believe that?

100
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,500
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting

101
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,960
subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so naive.

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
Well maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens

103
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,040
which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

104
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,920
Sounds a bit too farfetched to be true, don't you think?

105
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:58,840
All right, let's take a look now at a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,480
Now in Fluency Builder today we're going to start out with the story about organs, this

107
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,680
urban legend. Now what happens when the organ is taken, the story says that it's sold on

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
the black market.

109
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,840
That's right. So you probably hear this in the news or a lot of places, the black market

110
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,200
basically. It's not really a physical place, but it's where things are sold illegally.

111
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
So guns, organs, stuff like that.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,080
Exactly. So the black market, like you say, is not a place you can go to. It's an idea.

113
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,760
And it's basically anything that's illegal that's being sold. Like guns are often sold

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
in the black market.

115
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
That's right.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,400
Sometimes stolen cars are sold in the black market. Also organs can be sold in the black

117
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,920
market. And this is a serious problem because obviously all of this is illegal.

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:57,360
That's right. So the black market is where all this happens. Now moving on to the next

119
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,160
urban legend that we actually didn't really talk about too much is how many people believe

120
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,560
that popular songs have subliminal or satanic messages in them.

121
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,320
All right. So let's take a look at the word subliminal first. We all know what a message

122
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,440
is, right? It's something that's told to us. But a subliminal message is something that

123
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,480
is told to us without us knowing.

124
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
That's right.

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,000
So it goes into your mind, but you don't even know it. So it's something that a lot of people

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,240
believe in because they think that marketing people or big businesses are trying to control

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
our behavior.

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
That's right.

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,560
So I could say very quietly, Marco, buy me dinner.

130
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
And that's a subliminal message.

131
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,180
Marco says, hey, I was thinking about getting everyone dinner tonight. And then that's basically

132
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,520
a way to control your actions. And so whether or not this is possible, that's another discussion.

133
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
That's another discussion.

134
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,760
But so, yeah, that's basically what a lot of people say that some TV commercials or

135
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,320
ads have these subliminal messages that are trying to convince you or persuade you into

136
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
maybe consuming that product.

137
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,920
Exactly. But they're a little bit different from satanic messages.

138
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,120
That's right. So that's basically dealing with Satan or the devil.

139
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,680
That's right. So the idea that there are satanic messages means that they're messages about

140
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,520
the devil, about how maybe God does not exist or like, you know, that you should do evil,

141
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,800
not good. So they're very dark and very kind of angry messages.

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,400
I think they talk about, for example, I'm not sure which song it is, but like by Ozzy

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,280
Osbourne that if you play it backwards, supposedly there's this message that says, you know,

144
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,760
worship the devil and stuff like that. So that's where these urban legends come from.

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,400
But obviously it's either coincidence or not true.

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,760
Right. That's right. So we've got these messages that are also an urban legend. But the final

147
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,720
one is about KFC. So KFC would be Kentucky Fried Chicken. And what is the legend? The

148
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
legend is about their food.

149
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,880
That's right. They say that they don't really have real chickens. Well, they take chickens

150
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:20,320
and they just super grow them. The chickens are super grown in order for them to get bigger

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,840
and faster. And that's basically that they don't even really have heads. They just have

152
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,600
some hoses that go into their bodies and feed them. And in four weeks you have a chicken.

153
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,040
That's disgusting. That's disgusting. The idea is super grown chickens. And so they're

154
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,520
basically they're not real chickens.

155
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,720
Right. That's what the legend says is that they're not. I mean, they really are, but

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,080
they're not like naturally grown. You know, usually a chicken takes three months to grow

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
or something.

158
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,240
Yeah. All right. That's disgusting. I don't want to talk about that. But the idea of super

159
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,640
growing is like using chemicals to do something that's not natural.

160
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
That's right. That's right. Chemicals or hormones and stuff. So that's they use it, for example,

161
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,440
on plants. You can super grow a plant by adding fertilizer and vitamins and stuff to the soil

162
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,000
that makes it grow faster.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,640
Or maybe you have bigger carrots than normal, bigger potatoes because they're super grown.

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,760
That's right. So, all right. That's a lot of great stuff. Let's take a listen to the

165
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:24,520
dialogue one last time.

166
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,480
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

167
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
What do you mean?

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,960
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their

169
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,360
organs removed. Then they're sold on the black market.

170
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,480
Don't tell me you actually believe all that. Don't be so gullible. They are just urban

171
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,840
legends. They're just stories people make up to scare you.

172
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,480
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages

173
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,340
if you play them backwards. Can you believe that?

174
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,740
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting

175
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,720
subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so naive.

176
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, maybe you are right. But how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

179
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:16,120
All right. So, all these urban legends, they are obviously most of them, if not all of

180
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,680
them, are untrue. But they're very popular. Why do you think that is?

181
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,440
I think people like to believe these stories. They're gossipy. They're scary. You get to

182
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,040
make your friends kind of nervous about stuff. But I think also we don't trust a lot of these

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,320
things because we've heard for years and years and years and years about subliminal messages

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,280
and marketing strategies or about these kind of hidden messages in songs. So, there's part

185
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,520
of us that wants to believe them. But the other part is that you hear it enough, you

186
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,320
start to believe it.

187
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,360
Because I was reading up on a couple of them and the most recent ones are about how they

188
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,560
make the connection about how Nostradamus predicted the 9-11 incident or how Coca-Cola

189
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,560
is actually the one that invented Santa Claus. And even this KFC one where people just believe

190
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,500
a lot of different things. I even found one, the urban legend about be careful when you

191
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,560
go to the movie theater because there might be a syringe or something on the seat that

192
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,400
if you sit down it infects you with AIDS or something like this. So, there's so many of

193
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,840
them out there that if you think about it, they don't even really make sense.

194
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,000
They don't. And I understand that sometimes there'll be one news story like about a needle

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,960
in a candy box. And all of a sudden people say, well, don't eat candy because there's

196
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,920
needles in candy boxes.

197
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,920
And obviously, one time event turns into this massive kind of craze.

198
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,560
Yeah. But it is interesting, especially with this whole topic of subliminal messages. I

199
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,240
do remember that actually there was a marketing campaign that was banned in movie theaters

200
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,240
when the previews before the actual movie came on. Supposedly, they had the sound or

201
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,560
maybe on the screen somebody opening up a Coke can and the smell of Coke actually coming

202
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,980
into the theater. And that was kind of like subliminal marketing making people want to

203
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,740
go get a Coke.

204
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,220
Definitely. Well, we used to pump the exhaust from the popcorn maker when I worked in a

205
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,780
movie theater throughout the lobby. So, everyone smells it and it smells so good. Everyone

206
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,620
wants to buy it.

207
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,180
You want to buy popcorn?

208
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,380
Oh, yeah. We would totally use that.

209
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,620
So, yeah. That is a way of like, I guess it is subliminal because you're not directly

210
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,260
telling them to buy it, but you are just giving them all the...

211
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,580
Adjusting it through audio or visual or oratory cues.

212
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,700
Right. And then you have the opportunity to sell them the most expensive popcorn they'll

213
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,620
ever buy.

214
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,980
Exactly. Twelve dollars for a bag of popcorn.

215
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,380
All right. So, it is a very interesting topic. Let us know if you have any comments or questions
