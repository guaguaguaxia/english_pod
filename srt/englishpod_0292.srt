00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,660
My name is Catherine and we have another episode in our series all about giving presentations

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,660
in English.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,800
So this is show number eight for us.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
That's right.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,500
We're getting towards the end of the series.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,640
On this occasion, on presentation series number eight, we're going to continue with Mr. Ford

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,280
and try to handle a couple of problems that keep coming up.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
All right.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:34,320
So take a listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to discuss it.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,880
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,960
that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,080
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,640
We've pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,360
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,240
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,360
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,680
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,960
new X420.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,360
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,040
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,160
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,720
Sorry, I've lost my thread.

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,200
What was I talking about again?

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,480
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes, excuse me.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,880
Yes, anyway, the campaign.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,080
Well, let me see.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,320
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
No, sorry.

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
IT is still fixing it.

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay.

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,800
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,600
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Let me see.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,440
Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,840
When are the first advertisements scheduled for?

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
That's a good question.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Unfortunately, I don't have that information on me.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,600
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,080
Okay, Michael.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,120
The projector is fixed.

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,720
I think we're ready.

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Thank goodness.

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Okay, everyone.

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
Sorry for the delay.

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
So without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Enjoy!

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,040
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

53
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,120
This is not the advert.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,720
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,840
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,900
Can we take five?

57
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,840
Come on, Mr. Ford.

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
All right, we're back.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,860
And Mr. Ford faced a very embarrassing moment here.

60
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,640
But he also used a lot of interesting vocab.

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,160
Why don't we take a look at that now on Language Takeaway.

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Language Takeaway.

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,600
So at the beginning of today's dialogue, we heard a word that's very interesting.

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
An anecdote.

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,120
What is an anecdote, Marco?

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Right.

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,960
He started telling a story and that's basically an anecdote, a life experience or a story,

68
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,120
something that happened to you and you want to share with people.

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Right.

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,240
So an anecdote is a story.

71
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,240
So he was talking about golfing with a client and this is why.

72
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,720
And so this is called an anecdote.

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,820
He was telling a story about it.

74
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,900
After that, though, we realized that he is a little bit distracted.

75
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,800
He says, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
That's right.

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,720
So he's obviously talking about the computer and the marketing campaign.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,820
And then he starts talking about golf and how great it is.

79
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,080
So he says, I got sidetracked.

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,680
And that means that you got distracted or you started talking about something that's

81
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,480
not related to the topic.

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
So I really like to eat hamburgers and I like hamburgers with cheese, actually.

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,120
But wait, sorry, just got a little sidetracked there.

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,360
I think we should focus on English right now.

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
That's right.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,840
So it happens sometimes maybe you're even, maybe you're even talking to someone and something

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,940
is happening behind that person.

88
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,960
You get sidetracked and you're not really paying attention.

89
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
That's right.

90
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,040
And then after that, we realized that there's still a problem with the projector.

91
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,680
And Mr. Ford asks if it's working yet.

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,760
Jonathan, his assistant says, no, sorry, IT are still fixing it.

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
All right.

94
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,520
So this acronym IT, I think many of you have heard it and it means for information technology.

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
Okay.

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,940
Information technology that has to do with computers.

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,520
And so when we have a technical problem or a computer problem, we usually call IT.

98
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
That's right.

99
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,680
So your company probably has an IT department, or if you have, as Catherine said, a problem

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,760
with your computer, you just call IT to get them to fix it for you.

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Exactly.

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Another computer related word comes up later when Mr. Ford says that all of the information

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,740
about the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

104
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
That's right.

105
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,840
So PowerPoint, this is a computer program that is very well known for giving presentations.

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,560
So you probably use this if you ever have to give a presentation.

107
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
That's right.

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,240
PowerPoint is a part of the Microsoft Office suite.

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,160
So you know the program Word or the program Excel.

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,560
So PowerPoint helps you use your computer to give a presentation.

111
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,840
So you often hear us just talk about PowerPoint.

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,520
Can you help me with this PowerPoint in English?

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
That's right.

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Okay.

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,640
So that's all the words we have for you on Language Takeaway.

116
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:31,760
Why don't we listen to Mr. Ford again, and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

117
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,320
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements

118
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,360
that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

119
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,480
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

120
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,080
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,760
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

122
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,600
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,800
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the

125
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
new X420.

126
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,840
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

127
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,500
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

128
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,020
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

129
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,600
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,160
Sorry, I've lost my thread.

131
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
What was I talking about again?

132
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,880
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

133
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,240
Yes, excuse me.

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Yes, anyway, the campaign.

136
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,560
Well, let me see.

137
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,760
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

138
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
No, sorry.

139
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,960
IT is still fixing it.

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Okay.

141
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,280
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

142
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,080
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

143
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Let me see.

144
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,600
Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

145
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,320
When are the first advertisements scheduled for?

146
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,680
That's a good question.

147
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,760
Unfortunately, I don't have that information on me.

148
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,520
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,560
Okay, Michael.

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,600
The projector is fixed.

151
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
I think we're ready.

152
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Thank goodness.

153
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Okay, everyone.

154
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,640
Sorry for the delay.

155
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,800
So without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Enjoy!

157
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,540
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

158
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,620
This is not the advert.

159
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,200
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

160
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,360
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Can we take five?

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,520
Come on, Mr. Ford.

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
All right.

164
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,000
So we've picked out a lot of great phrases for you today.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,760
Let's start with the first one on Fluency Builder.

166
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,040
Fluency Builder.

167
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,840
At the very beginning, Mr. Ford says we have pulled out all the stops to make a really

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,200
great product.

169
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
That's right.

170
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,440
So the phrase used here, to pull out all the stops, what does that mean?

171
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,520
Well, you don't have to think about what it actually means.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,040
We use this when we're trying to say that we've done our best.

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,600
We have really gone as far as we can, 100%.

174
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,640
We're giving everything we can to make this thing the best that it can be.

175
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Okay.

176
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,200
So you've put a lot of effort and resources into making something great.

177
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
You didn't hold back.

178
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,520
You didn't save any money.

179
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,680
You just went for it.

180
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
Okay, very good.

181
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,160
Now when we were talking about Mr. Ford being distracted and he started talking about golf,

182
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,240
he said, oh, I'm sorry, I've lost my thread.

183
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
What was I talking about again?

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
All right.

185
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,440
So this is interesting because the word thread can mean something that you, it's like a string

186
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,080
that you use to sew clothes with.

187
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,480
But in this particular case, we're talking about a thread of conversation.

188
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,680
And so that's basically the topic that he's talking about.

189
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Okay.

190
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,160
So when he said, I lost my thread, he makes reference to the thread of conversation of

191
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
what he was talking about.

192
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Right.

193
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,360
So he's talking about golf, but he lost his thread.

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,840
So then he doesn't remember what he was talking about.

195
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,400
Okay, very good.

196
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,920
And Mr. Ford actually faced a couple of questions from the audience members.

197
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,320
One of them asked about the schedule for the campaign and he said, you know what, I really

198
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,040
don't have that information.

199
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,960
I will have to get back to you on that point.

200
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Well, this is a really great way to answer a question you don't actually know how to

201
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,920
answer.

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,840
In this case, Mr. Ford doesn't have the answer to this, this audience member's question,

203
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
like you said, Marco.

204
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,560
He just says, I will have to get back to you on that.

205
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,880
I will have to let you know later.

206
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,480
So it's a much better, so it's much better to say, I will get back to you instead of

207
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,680
saying, I don't know.

208
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,560
For example, if your boss asks you, I don't know, how were sales last year compared to

209
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
this year?

210
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,240
And if you don't know, it's really not recommendable to say, I don't know.

211
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
You don't want to say, I don't know.

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,360
It makes you sound like you don't know anything.

213
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
So in this case, you say, listen, I really have to get back to you about that.

214
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,760
I want to check some numbers.

215
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Very good.

216
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay, so moving on to our next phrase.

217
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,760
When finally he was going to present the ad campaign, he said, so without further ado,

218
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,560
the new 420 marketing campaign.

219
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,840
This phrase, without further ado, is something that we commonly hear in speeches or more

220
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,440
formal occasions, but it's something that we say when we want to introduce something.

221
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,360
We say, we're not going to talk about it anymore.

222
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Let's just do it.

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Let's just show you.

224
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,720
So the word ado, is this, this is I think like classic English.

225
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
It's not really common to hear it anymore.

226
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,280
No, there is actually a very famous play by Shakespeare called Much Ado About Nothing.

227
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,760
And that means, you know, that there's a lot of talking and a lot of problems and a lot

228
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,480
of drama about this one thing.

229
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,000
And so basically when we say the phrase without further ado, we're saying, you know, without

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,240
further talking, talking about this anymore.

231
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Yeah.

232
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Okay.

233
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,640
So it's a nice way to say, okay, finally we're going to do this, or finally we're going to

234
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
see this.

235
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,400
And obviously the video was not the campaign.

236
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,960
It was his golfing holiday in Barbados.

237
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,680
So he asked someone if he could take five.

238
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
All right.

239
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,440
This phrase to take five is very, very common in English.

240
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,320
And it's just another way to say, can we take a five minute break?

241
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
So maybe you can ask your teacher, excuse me, can we, can we take five or, or something

242
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
like that?

243
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Yeah.

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,200
Or, hey guys, I'm, I'm, I need a glass of water.

245
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Let's take five.

246
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Right.

247
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
So that means let's have a short break.

248
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,840
Let's take a five minute break, but it doesn't always necessarily have to be five minutes.

249
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,240
Now it can be seven minutes or 10 minutes, but take five means a short break.

250
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Okay.

251
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Very good.

252
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,880
So you don't say, can we take 10 or can we take seven?

253
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,840
Now usually just say take five, take five.

254
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Okay.

255
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
All right.

256
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,360
So a lot of phrases there, a lot of great stuff.

257
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,920
Let's review it one last time.

258
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,480
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements

259
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,200
that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop, affordability, quality, speed, and

260
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,640
reliability.

261
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,280
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

262
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,960
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

263
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,800
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

264
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,920
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

265
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,280
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the

266
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
new X420.

267
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,240
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

268
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

269
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,160
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

270
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

271
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm sorry, I've lost my thread.

272
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,800
What was I talking about again?

273
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,040
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

274
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
Yes, excuse me.

275
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

276
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Yes.

277
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Anyway, the campaign.

278
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,720
Well, let me see.

279
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,920
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

280
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
No, sorry.

281
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,080
IT is still fixing it.

282
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Okay.

283
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,440
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

284
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,240
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

285
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Let me see.

286
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,760
Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

287
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,480
When are the first advertisements scheduled for?

288
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
That's a good question.

289
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,920
Unfortunately, I don't have that information on me.

290
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,400
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

291
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,680
Okay, Michael.

292
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,720
The projector is fixed.

293
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
I think we're ready.

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Thank goodness.

295
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Okay, everyone.

296
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,760
Sorry for the delay.

297
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,960
So without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

298
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Enjoy.

299
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

300
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,740
This is not the advert.

301
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,320
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

302
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,400
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

303
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,520
Can we take five?

304
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,840
Come on, Mr. Ford.

305
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,160
Okay, so we're coming towards the end of our presentation series.

306
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,880
So be sure to listen to us next week when we're talking about presentation series part

307
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,980
nine.

308
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,400
And as you may know, it ends with part 10.

309
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,160
So then we'll start with a new series very, very soon.

310
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,840
And I don't know if you have any questions or any suggestions about a series, you can

311
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,960
always contact us.

312
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,880
Yeah, please do let us know what are the things that you have a hard time with when you're

313
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
studying English?

314
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,960
Are there things that are confusing or difficult?

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,640
We're happy to hear your suggestions and we hope that we can help out.

316
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,720
That's about it for us today, though.

317
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
So until next time, bye.

318
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:43,740
Bye Bye
