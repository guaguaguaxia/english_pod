00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,240
And my name is Catherine and today we have a cold lesson.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
That's right.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,920
It's the winter season and of course it gets cold in a lot of different places around the

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,480
world and so we're going to talk about heating.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,560
Okay, this is very important but before we do get started, we have a very important word

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,200
to preview in Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,080
Alright, so we're going to preview the word freezing.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,040
It is freezing today by the way so this is very appropriate.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,160
Freezing means very, very, very cold.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,800
Okay, it is freezing.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,520
Okay, so it's very cold.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,040
It's freezing today.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,280
It's so cold in fact you can't have water outside because the water will become ice.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
It will freeze.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,040
Okay, great word.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:02,600
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very first time.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
It's freezing in here.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,400
Can I turn up the heat?

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,160
Don't touch that thermostat.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,720
You don't pay the bills around here.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,520
Dad, are you serious?

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,800
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,680
Look, I can see my breath.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,840
Put on a sweater.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,160
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,760
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,960
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,600
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,100
We never caught a cold.

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
You should be grateful.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,160
Alright, we're back and this is actually what a lot of dads are like I think around the

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
world.

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,840
Yep, my dad definitely liked to keep the heat low in the house.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,880
Alright, so we'll talk about that a little bit later but let's take a look at some four

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,440
words on Language Takeaway today.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Language Takeaway

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,880
Well, this first word is important for anyone who has a home with heating.

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
It's called a thermostat.

43
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,440
Alright, a thermostat.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
What is a thermostat?

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:20,800
A thermostat is a dial or like a device on the wall that tells you how hot or how

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
cold the house is.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,160
It's like a thermometer for your house.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,920
Okay, so you can move the thermostat, the temperature to make the house warmer or colder,

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
right?

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,800
Right, so if it says it's 20 degrees and I think that's too cold, I can turn the thermostat

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,240
up to 23 degrees.

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:44,760
Alright, and well very much related to a thermostat and what this device does is our next word,

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
central heating.

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Right, so if you have central heating, you have a thermostat.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,320
It's the way to control the heat and central heating means that you have one heater for

56
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,880
the whole house and so the air comes into all the different rooms.

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,840
So not many places in China have this but for example in the United States, in Canada,

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
it is very common.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
Okay, so your house or your apartment building will have central heating and then you can

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
control how cold or warm the house is with thermostats.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Exactly.

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,080
Very good and well our next word is related to temperature and it's chilly.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,200
Chilly, okay, so there's a big difference between chilly and freezing.

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,440
Freezing means very very very cold.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Chilly means a little cold.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Right, so it's a little cold.

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
It's a bit chilly.

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Right, so it's a bit chilly today, I'm going to wear a hat.

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,480
Okay, if it's freezing, I'm going to wear a hat and mittens and a scarf and coat and

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
boots.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,160
Right, so if it's a bit chilly, it's not very cold and well moving on, the dad mentioned

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,160
about him having a furnace when he was young.

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,280
That's right, the dad had a furnace in his house and the furnace is a way to heat your

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
house.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,200
It's like a stove.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,760
So yeah, just consider it like a big oven, right?

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,680
Maybe you've seen it in the old movies where you would have to throw firewood into the

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,960
furnace to make it heat up the house.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,400
Exactly, and so this is very common in older homes and not very common in apartments.

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Right, and well, that's all the words we have for language takeaway today.

81
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:28,520
Why don't we listen to this chilly dialogue again.

82
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
It's freezing in here.

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
Can I turn up the heat?

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,100
Don't touch that thermostat.

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,640
You don't pay the bills around here.

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Dad, are you serious?

87
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,400
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,600
Look, I can see my breath.

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Put on a sweater.

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

91
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,080
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,700
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

93
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,880
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

94
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,560
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

95
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
We never caught a cold.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,320
You should be grateful.

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Alright we're back.

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,440
So now we have prepared for you three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Fluency Builder.

100
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,240
Okay, so this first phrase is related to thermostat.

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,200
So thermostat like we said is like a thermometer but we can control the temperature.

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,540
So if we want to make the temperature hotter, we turn up the thermostat.

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,200
So this is a phrasal verb, to turn up the heat.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,880
You could say this about heat.

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
You could say this about noise too.

106
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Can you turn up the radio?

107
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,160
Turn up the volume.

108
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,400
So it's to increase.

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
To increase, to make bigger or warmer or louder.

110
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,800
Alright and if we wanted to decrease the temperature in the thermostat, you would say...

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
Turn down.

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Turn down the heat.

113
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Exactly.

114
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
So it's too hot in here.

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
Can you please turn down the heat?

116
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
Alright, very good.

117
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,640
And our next phrase is, well the dad was talking about the bills and how expensive it is to

118
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,680
use the thermostat and he said, I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill.

119
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,520
Okay, so a bill is like you know, something that you pay.

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
It's money.

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,120
And so in this case, I don't want you to run up the bill.

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,360
That means to increase the amount of money I have to spend.

123
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,440
So maybe if you leave your television on all night, you're running up your electricity

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
bill.

125
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Exactly.

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,840
And if you leave it on 10 hours a day, you run up the phone bill and your mother kills

127
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
you.

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Right.

129
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,320
Alright and well the daughter was complaining about her catching a cold.

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,640
To catch a cold.

131
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,920
Alright, so remember this.

132
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,680
A cold is when you have maybe a runny nose and a cough and a sore throat.

133
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,020
It usually happens when the weather changes.

134
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,600
But we don't get a cold.

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
You catch a cold.

136
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Okay.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,880
And remember like in baseball, you throw and catch.

138
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
It's something that's fast.

139
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Alright, so you catch a cold.

140
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
What about the flu?

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,400
Do you get the flu or catch the flu?

142
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,580
So you can't catch a flu but you can catch a cold.

143
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,680
Just remember this phrase.

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
To catch a cold.

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,000
I caught the cold.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,920
To catch a cold or I caught a cold.

147
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,080
It's almost like if I have it, I can throw it to you Marco.

148
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Achoo!

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
And you catch it.

150
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,720
Right, because it's in the air, the virus.

151
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,480
Yeah, it passes very quickly.

152
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,560
Alright, very good.

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
So an interesting dialogue.

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's listen to it one last time.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's freezing in here.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Can I turn up the heat?

157
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Don't touch that thermostat.

158
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,160
You don't pay the bills around here.

159
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,920
Dad, are you serious?

160
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,200
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

161
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,080
Look, I can see my breath.

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,240
Put on a sweater.

163
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

165
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,160
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

166
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,360
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

167
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,020
We used it to cook, heat the house and even dry our clothes.

168
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,500
We never caught a cold.

169
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,120
You should be grateful.

170
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:15,280
Alright, we're back and well you mentioned about the thermostat and your dad actually

171
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
controlling the heating at home.

172
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,480
Was this the case like this in this scenario?

173
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
It was.

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,200
Sometimes we would have to wear more clothes because we didn't want to run up the bill.

175
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,560
We had a special situation in my house because I'm from Chicago and it's very cold in the

176
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
winters in Chicago but we had a fireplace.

177
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,400
Even if it was very cold, we always had firewood and we could put on the fire in the fireplace

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,840
to keep warm so everyone would stay in the living room and read and listen to music and

179
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
just relax.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,440
Now I heard that because when you're burning wood, it causes some pollution.

181
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,320
In some cities, it's banned to actually turn on or to have a fireplace.

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
That's right.

183
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,880
But in Chicago, you can still do it.

184
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Absolutely.

185
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,240
And in most of the states, you can.

186
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,640
Although a lot of people in new houses, they don't have real fireplaces.

187
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,600
They have electric fireplaces.

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,160
So you can use a light switch to turn on your fire.

189
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
It's not a real fire.

190
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
It's just a glowing light.

191
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
It's very fancy.

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,560
Alright, well very good.

193
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,400
This is an interesting lesson especially because the winter season is coming up and well everyone

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
is cold.

195
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,760
