00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,280
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,240
And today we're bringing you again the great series, I'm Sorry I Love You, Part 6.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,280
The newest installment in the EnglishPod soap opera.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,000
Drama, romance.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,080
Love, tragedy.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,400
All of it here at EnglishPod and in our series.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,880
So today we have a really great dialogue.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,480
I just can't believe what's happening here.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,560
But before we get into it, we need to preview one word.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
That's right.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,600
So let's take a look at it in Vocabulary Preview.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Vocabulary Preview.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,560
Well, we're going to preview this word.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,840
Sleeping with.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Sleeping with.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,200
Sleeping with someone.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,680
Sleeping with him.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Yes.

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,320
So, it seems pretty easy.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,360
I mean, sleeping with, it just sounds like you are in bed with somebody.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,960
Yeah, but you are doing a little bit more than sleeping.

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
All right.

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,440
So, in English, this phrase actually means that you are involved with someone and have

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,200
an intimate sexual relationship, right?

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Yes.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
You are in a relationship with someone and you are having sex.

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Exactly.

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,160
So be careful how you use it because I know that sometimes you want to translate and just

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,760
say, well, they are in the same bed together, but it's not that they're having sex.

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Right.

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,200
And most of the time in English, the phrase sleeping with means sex.

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Right.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay.

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Sleeping with.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Be careful.

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Okay.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,560
Well, let's find out why are we talking about sleeping with?

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Well, obviously, somebody is sleeping with somebody.

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:54,600
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about it.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,080
This is ridiculous.

44
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,760
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
How could you do this?

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
You know what?

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm out of here.

48
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Wait.

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,400
Doctor, how is this possible?

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,080
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
I have something to confess.

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm sorry, Veronica.

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
I lied.

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Wait, what?

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,880
What do you mean?

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,000
I lied.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
You aren't even pregnant.

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,440
There's no bun in the oven.

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,120
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,320
Veronica, I love you.

61
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,920
What are you talking about?

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Who?

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,640
Who are you?

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
It's me, Daniel.

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,840
Don't you remember me from high school?

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,720
I sat behind you in science class.

67
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,880
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

68
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
You were insane.

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
We never even spoke.

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,160
Because Veronica, it's not fair.

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,720
I love you.

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,200
I have since the first day we met.

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,160
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,320
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

77
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,760
You will be mine now, one way or another.

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:46,880
Get your hands off of her.

80
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,000
Scandal again.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,360
Just poor Veronica and Steven, I just, I don't know how their relationship could get

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,160
more complicated.

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
It's amazing.

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,480
They're having an amazing adventure in their love life.

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm sure glad my love life looks nothing like this.

86
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
All right.

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
So we saw some really great words.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,960
So let's take a look at them in Language Takeaway.

89
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
Language Takeaway.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,920
The words we're looking at now are about feelings.

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,240
And so let's take a look at the first one.

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Confess.

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Okay.

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Confess.

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
To confess.

96
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,560
To confess.

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
So confess.

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
What does that mean?

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,720
When you confess something, you tell a secret that you've been hiding.

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Okay.

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
So that's pretty easy.

102
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,440
So you have a secret and you want to tell it to someone.

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
So you are confessing.

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Yeah.

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,920
And it's usually something negative.

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Negative.

107
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Oh, okay.

108
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,800
So Marco, I confess that I stole $5 from you.

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Oh, you did?

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Yeah.

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Sorry.

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
No wonder my wallet was lighter.

113
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Yeah.

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
All right.

115
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
So confess.

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,480
I shall not forgive you for this.

117
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Oh, no.

118
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
All right.

119
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,560
Let's take a look at our next word.

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Overwhelmed.

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Overwhelmed.

122
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,280
I am overwhelmed.

123
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,560
So when I am overwhelmed, I am filled with emotion.

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Okay.

125
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
With emotion.

126
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
It can be good emotions and bad emotions, right?

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah.

128
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
But you just feel too much.

129
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,040
Like you're going to explode.

130
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,120
Okay.

131
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,360
I am overwhelmed with joy.

132
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Yes.

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,880
Or I'm overwhelmed with work.

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,640
And I am overwhelmed with jealousy.

135
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Like this guy.

136
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Right.

137
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
And that's our third word.

138
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Jealousy.

139
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,060
Jealousy.

140
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,080
So this is interesting because jealousy is the noun.

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
That's right.

142
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,200
It's the feeling of being jealous.

143
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Which is the adjective.

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Which is the adjective.

145
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,640
So what does it mean when you are jealous?

146
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,080
It means that you see somebody and you want what they have.

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Okay.

148
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
You want what they have.

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Yeah.

150
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,880
So in this case, the doctor is jealous of Veronica's boyfriend because the doctor wants

151
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Veronica.

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Okay.

153
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Jealous.

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,520
So, Erica, are you a jealous wife?

155
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
I don't know.

156
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Maybe a little bit.

157
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
A little bit.

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Maybe even to the extent of telling someone that they're pregnant.

159
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
All right.

160
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Jealousy.

161
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
Okay.

162
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,600
And let's take a look at our next two words which are actually kind of insults, right?

163
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Yeah.

164
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,160
They're not very kind words at all.

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Okay.

166
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
But you got to learn them anyways.

167
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah.

168
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay.

169
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Let's take a look at this one.

170
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Jerk.

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Jerk.

172
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
He's a jerk.

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
J-E-R-K.

174
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Jerk.

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Jerk.

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,960
So what does it mean if someone is a jerk?

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,480
A stupid and mean person.

178
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Plain and simple as that.

179
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Yeah.

180
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Stupid and mean.

181
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
So, can a woman be a jerk?

182
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,920
It's mostly male but now it's becoming more common to use with women as well.

183
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Okay.

184
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
So I can say he is a jerk or she is a jerk.

185
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah.

186
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
But it is more common for men.

187
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Okay.

188
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,080
And now, let's take a look at our last word.

189
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,640
You lying bastard.

190
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Bastard.

191
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Bastard.

192
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Bastard.

193
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow, this is pretty strong as well.

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You got to be careful about this one.

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This one is almost a swear word.

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Almost.

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah.

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Like on the line.

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So what does it mean if you call someone a bastard?

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,560
Well, literally, it means your mother and father were not married when you were born.

203
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
When you were born.

204
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Exactly.

205
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,760
So, it is a pretty big insult.

206
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Yes.

207
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,200
A little bit, I guess.

208
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,520
But it doesn't really, really mean that your mother and father weren't married.

209
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,000
It means that you are a jerk.

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are a jerk.

211
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are a really big jerk.

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are a mean person.

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
A really mean person.

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,320
So jerk isn't as strong as a bastard, right?

215
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Yes.

216
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Bastard is stronger.

217
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Okay.

218
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,640
So you got to be careful when you throw that word in there or how you would use it.

219
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,120
And again, it's for men, right?

220
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Not for women.

221
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Yeah.

222
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
You can't use this word with women.

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Okay.

224
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,440
There is another one out there but that will have to wait for another English pod.

225
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, apparently, all of these words are just for men.

226
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,600
What did we do wrong?

227
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Marco, I can't begin to tell you.

228
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Okay.

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Okay.

230
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,040
So let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and look at some great

231
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:28,440
phrases.

232
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,960
This is ridiculous.

233
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,640
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

234
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
How could you do this?

235
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
You know what?

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm out of here.

237
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Wait.

238
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
What?

239
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,720
Doctor, how is this possible?

240
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,600
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
I have something to confess.

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,040
I'm sorry, Veronica.

243
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
I lied.

244
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Wait.

245
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
What?

246
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,400
What do you mean?

247
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,520
I lied.

248
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,200
You aren't even pregnant.

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
There's no bun in the oven.

250
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,840
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

251
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Veronica, I love you.

252
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
What are you talking about?

253
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,160
Who are you?

254
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
It's me, Daniel.

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,240
Don't you remember me from high school?

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
I sat behind you in science class.

257
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,360
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

258
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,980
You're insane.

259
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,960
We never even spoke.

260
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,920
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

261
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,800
This is Veronica, it's not fair.

262
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
I love you.

263
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,720
I have since the first day we met.

264
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,520
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

265
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,680
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

266
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,840
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

267
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,360
You will be mine now, one way or another.

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

269
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,760
Get your hands off of her.

270
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,080
Alright so great stuff, jerk, bastards, all that good words going around.

271
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,040
But we've also got some amazing phrases.

272
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,140
So why don't we take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

273
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,360
Fluency Builder.

274
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,400
Alright so in Fluency Builder today we have three great phrases.

275
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,120
Let's take a look at the first one.

276
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Bun in the oven.

277
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
A bun in the oven.

278
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,280
A bun in the oven.

279
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,120
Okay, this is obviously an idiomatic phrase, right?

280
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,080
Well, it could be literal as well, right?

281
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,520
Like you could actually have a piece of bread in your oven.

282
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,360
Right, bun is a piece of bread in the oven.

283
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,000
But in this context we're not using it.

284
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, it means you're pregnant.

285
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
So the baby is the bun.

286
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,640
And the oven is your stomach.

287
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,240
So you say she has a bun in the oven.

288
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,400
Yes, she's pregnant.

289
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
She's pregnant.

290
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Okay.

291
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,120
So it could be difficult to understand if you don't really have the explanation, right?

292
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
You would say what?

293
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,680
She has bread in the oven?

294
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,440
Yeah, a bun in the oven.

295
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Okay.

296
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,120
Now let's take a look at a second one.

297
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,160
Couldn't help myself.

298
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,840
I couldn't help myself.

299
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,040
I couldn't help myself.

300
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,680
So when you can't help yourself, you can't control yourself.

301
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Right.

302
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,180
You did something but you couldn't control it.

303
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
You couldn't stop it.

304
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
You couldn't stop it.

305
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,480
Okay, so let's listen to some examples of how you would use I couldn't help myself because

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,720
it's a phrase that you can use in many different ways, right?

307
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
That's right.

308
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,800
Let's listen.

309
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,080
Example one.

310
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,680
I just couldn't help myself when I saw your car.

311
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,400
I just had to buy it.

312
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Example two.

313
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm sorry.

314
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,920
I couldn't help myself.

315
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,400
I just started laughing.

316
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,000
Example three.

317
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,880
The cake was so good.

318
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,640
I couldn't help myself.

319
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I ate it all.

320
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
All right, perfect.

321
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Couldn't help myself.

322
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Easy.

323
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,100
Now, the doctor, he couldn't help himself from lying to Veronica because he was angry

324
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,680
that her boyfriend, Steven, came into the picture.

325
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,320
Came into the picture.

326
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,960
To come into the picture.

327
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,560
Okay, so what does it mean when somebody comes into the picture?

328
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,200
Well, basically, you appear in somebody's life.

329
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
You come into somebody's life.

330
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,880
So imagine that your life is a picture and somebody all of a sudden comes into it.

331
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
They come into the picture.

332
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,920
They come into your life.

333
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Come into your life.

334
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Yes.

335
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,760
So he's angry that Steven appeared into Veronica's life and they're in love and all that stuff.

336
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah.

337
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
All right.

338
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,040
Well, these are some great phrases and why don't we listen to them again in context?

339
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:09,480
So let's listen to the dialogue.

340
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,980
This is ridiculous.

341
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,640
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

342
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
How could you do this?

343
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
You know what?

344
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
I'm out of here.

345
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,120
Wait.

346
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,280
Doctor, how is this possible?

347
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,000
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

348
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,480
I have something to confess.

349
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm sorry, Veronica.

350
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I lied.

351
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Wait, what?

352
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,800
What do you mean?

353
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,920
I lied.

354
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,600
You aren't even pregnant.

355
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,360
There's no bun in the oven.

356
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,120
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

357
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,240
Veronica, I love you.

358
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,800
What are you talking about?

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,560
Who are you?

360
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
It's me, Daniel.

361
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,760
Don't you remember me from high school?

362
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,640
I sat behind you in science class.

363
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,760
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

364
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,400
You're insane.

365
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
We never even spoke.

366
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,320
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

367
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,160
Because Veronica, it's not fair.

368
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,640
I love you.

369
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,080
I have since the first day we met.

370
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

371
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,040
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

372
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,200
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

373
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,640
You will be mine now, one way or another.

374
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,440
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

375
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:57,600
Get your hands off of her.

376
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,880
Okay so Veronica's not pregnant.

377
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,880
That was a close one.

378
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Actually they're not married.

379
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,640
So this is a very controversial topic, right?

380
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Being knocked up.

381
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,200
Yes, nice phrase.

382
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,360
So there's a lot of interesting phrases and ways you can talk about pregnancy.

383
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,440
So if you're knocked up, you're pregnant.

384
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,840
Right, so you could hear that in movies.

385
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,880
It's not really, I would say, a proper way of saying it.

386
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,680
No, it's not that polite because it gives you the idea that it was a mistake.

387
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,240
So you would say, she got knocked up.

388
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,200
Yes, another common phrase is preggers.

389
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,160
Preggers, I heard this is more Australian, right?

390
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,600
She's preggers, so she's pregnant.

391
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
So it's actually a pretty interesting topic.

392
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:52,200
I know that for example, in Latin America, if a girl that's maybe in her early 20s gets

393
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,240
pregnant accidentally by her boyfriend, usually the families expect them to get married.

394
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Really?

395
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Yeah, so it's kind of like, should they get married, should they not?

396
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,400
So there's a lot of pressure.

397
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,080
A lot of pressure.

398
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,200
But it's different in other countries, right?

399
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,060
So I don't know, for you guys, what's it like in your country where you live?

400
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,000
Is there pressure on the guy and the girl to get married?

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,760
I mean, should Steven and Veronica get married in this situation?

402
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,280
Or what about just living together?

403
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,840
Or as they say, living in sin, right?

404
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,880
Living in sin.

405
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,560
Living together, living in sin.

406
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,960
So is it okay to just live together with your girlfriend or should you get married before?

407
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,920
This is a controversial topic, so we'll have a lot of different opinions, but it should

408
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
be interesting.

409
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes, so visit our website and tell us what you think, EnglishPod.com.
