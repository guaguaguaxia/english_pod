1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,740
Today I'm here with Erika.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,740
Hi, Marco.

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,740
And I'm Marco.

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,460
And we're bringing you a great elementary lesson about a situation at an office.

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,460
That's true.

8
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,620
Today we're going to learn some phrases for asking for time off.

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,620
Right.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,620
Asking for time off.

11
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,940
Or asking for leave.

12
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,940
Asking for leave.

13
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,940
Right.

14
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,940
Right.

15
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,780
So we're going to give you some great phrases and vocabulary for when you want to ask for

16
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,060
leave.

17
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,740
So let's just listen to our dialogue today.

18
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:42,780
We're at an office where Liv wants some time off.

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,540
Mr. McKenna, do you have a second?

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,420
I need to talk to you about something.

21
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,420
Sure.

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,420
Liv, what can I do for you?

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,460
Well, I was just wondering.

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,380
You see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister's getting married

25
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,140
and the wedding is overseas and, well...

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,220
You want to take some time off.

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,220
Is that right?

28
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,020
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

29
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,660
What dates are you planning on taking off?

30
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,140
I'll need at least two months' notice so that I can plan for your absence.

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,140
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

32
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,900
Would you be okay with that?

33
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,540
Well, I guess so.

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,220
Well, it sounds like the boss wasn't too happy about Liv's request.

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,780
Well, she wanted to take off for 30 days, so...

36
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,340
I guess that is a long time.

37
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,500
That is a long time.

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,060
I wish I could do that.

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,060
Yeah.

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,360
Okay, we have some great words for you today, so let's start with our language takeaway.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,260
Language takeaway.

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,300
Four words on our language takeaway today.

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,460
Erika, why don't you tell us the first one?

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,580
The first word is vacation days.

45
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,740
Vacation days.

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,060
Vacation days.

47
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,940
So what are vacation days?

48
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,860
Basically, it's the number of personal leave days.

49
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,860
So the number of days that you can take to go on vacation.

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,660
How many vacation days do you have?

51
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,540
Yeah, I think I have not so many.

52
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,660
I only have 10 vacation days.

53
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,660
10 vacation...

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,540
Well, in some countries, 10 vacation days is normal.

55
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,620
In another, I guess it's 10, 15, even 20, I've heard.

56
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
Well...

58
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
Vacation days.

59
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,380
We can't take too many vacation days or else we won't make any more podcasts.

60
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,860
Why don't we look at our second word?

61
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Overseas.

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Overseas.

63
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Overseas.

64
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,980
When you travel overseas, you travel over the ocean.

65
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,580
Over the ocean to another country.

66
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
Exactly.

67
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
Okay, overseas.

68
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,500
Okay, and our third word for language takeaway, unpaid leave.

69
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,140
Unpaid leave.

70
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Unpaid leave.

71
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,980
So this is time off without pay.

72
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,980
Without pay.

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
Simple.

74
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,980
Right.

75
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Unpaid leave.

76
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,340
And our last word, notice.

77
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Notice.

78
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Notice.

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
Notice.

80
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,540
So we have some great examples on how we use notice and from these examples, I'm sure

81
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,060
you'll be able to understand exactly what they mean.

82
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,980
Example one.

83
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,100
If you want to quit your job, make sure you give enough notice.

84
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:29,260
You'll need to tell us four weeks in advance.

85
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,780
Example two.

86
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,580
You didn't give me enough notice about this project.

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,300
I didn't have enough time to finish it.

88
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,260
So when you give someone notice, you give them information in advance.

89
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
In advance, right.

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,140
So if I want to take time off, I need to give my boss notice, advance information.

91
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,220
Right, 15 day notice or a 20 day notice, etc.

92
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,020
Great, so that's our language takeaway for today.

93
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,460
Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time and this time it's going to

94
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:13,420
be really slow.

95
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,620
Mr. McKenna, do you have a second?

96
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,260
I need to talk to you about something.

97
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,860
Sure, Liv, what can I do for you?

98
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,340
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year,

99
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,140
but my sister is getting married and the wedding is overseas and well...

100
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,660
You want to take some time off, is that right?

101
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,100
Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

102
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,740
What dates are you planning on taking off?

103
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,620
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

104
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,460
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th, would you be okay with

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,460
that?

106
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,100
I guess so.

107
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,300
A lot of non-native English speakers sometimes feel quite nervous about asking their boss

108
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,780
for time off, hey?

109
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,220
Yeah, I guess it's a kind of a difficult subject.

110
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah, but today we're going to teach you some great phrases that you can use next time you

111
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,180
need to ask for some time off.

112
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,980
Great, so why don't we take a look at putting it together?

113
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Putting it together.

114
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,740
Okay, so on putting it together today, we're going to talk about some great phrases that

115
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,020
you can use when approaching your boss.

116
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,100
Yes, we heard Liv say this.

117
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,340
Do you have a second?

118
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,840
Do you have a second?

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,620
This is a nice way to make sure your boss isn't busy when you want to ask him something.

120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,500
Right, right, right, but we could also say this in two different ways.

121
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,980
Let's listen.

122
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,100
Do you have a minute?

123
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,540
I want to ask you something.

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Do you have a sec?

125
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,460
I need to talk to you.

126
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,060
A great way to approach your boss.

127
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,100
Yeah, I love this phrase, do you have a sec?

128
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,540
Yeah, do you have a sec?

129
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
It's really natural.

130
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,340
Okay, so you've asked your boss for leave and you want to make sure that he agrees with

131
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
you.

132
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,660
Yes, and this is how Liv did it.

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,300
Would you be okay with that?

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,180
Would you be okay with that?

135
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,820
This is a great pattern, and we've got two other examples of how you can use it.

136
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,000
Example one.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Are you alright with that?

138
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,060
Example two.

139
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,300
Will you be okay with this?

140
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,440
Example three.

141
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm fine with that.

142
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,660
Okay, great examples, great patterns, really useful language.

143
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
Yes.

144
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:07,060
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue a third time.

145
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,020
Mr. McKenna, do you have a second?

146
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,580
I need to talk to you about something.

147
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,620
Sure, Liv, what can I do for you?

148
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,220
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year,

149
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,380
but my sister's getting married and the wedding is over season, well...

150
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,500
You want to take some time off, is that right?

151
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,300
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

152
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,940
What dates are you planning on taking off?

153
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,420
I'll need at least two months' notice so that I can plan for your absence.

154
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,420
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

155
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,180
Would you be okay with that?

156
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,380
Well, I guess so.

157
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,860
I really noticed how Liv in this dialogue used a lot of really polite language, hey?

158
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,700
Yeah, I guess when you're talking to your boss, you really have to be respectful and

159
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
you have to use really polite language.

160
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,980
What sort of things did she do to make herself seem more polite?

161
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:09,300
Well, she said a couple of interesting phrases, for example, well, I was just wondering.

162
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,380
Yeah, I was just wondering.

163
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,700
Right, it's like, well, she's kind of setting up to ask for a favor or something.

164
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,340
And she also used another phrase that I thought was interesting.

165
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,860
Yeah, she also said, I was just hoping that.

166
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Yes.

167
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,820
Right, I was just hoping that maybe I could take some time off.

168
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,940
Yeah, again, that sort of doesn't sound too strong, so it seems a bit more polite.

169
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,740
Yeah, because if she said, well, I want to take some time off, that's too strong.

170
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,380
Yeah, so I was just hoping.

171
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,900
And then, well, the boss says, okay, well, when do you want to leave?

172
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,300
And she says, well, I was thinking of, right?

173
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,580
I was thinking of.

174
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Yeah.

175
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,260
Again, if she would have said, I want to.

176
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Yes.

177
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Too strong, right?

178
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Yeah.

179
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,500
In English, sometimes we are careful to not be too direct when we're asking for something,

180
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
right?

181
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Right, yeah.

182
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,460
Because if you're too direct, you sound a little bit impolite.

183
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,020
Yeah, you sound rude.

184
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
Yeah.

185
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,980
Okay, so great tips and great things to take into consideration the next time you're talking

186
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
into your boss.

187
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,820
All right, guys, we're out of time, but thanks for listening and be sure to check out our

But I guess until then, it's goodbye.

192
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:37,460
Bye.
