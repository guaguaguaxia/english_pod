00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
My name is Katrin and if you've been listening to our recent lessons, you know that we've

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,320
been talking a lot about food.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,960
That's right and today we have another lesson all about food from a different country.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,240
Last time we took a look at Mexican food, Chinese food.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,960
Now we are talking about Indian food.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,020
Okay, Indian food is very famous for being spicy but not all of it is spicy.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,080
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out just what kinds of food you will

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,520
find at an Indian restaurant.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
So where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
It's an Indian restaurant.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,480
I know you have never had Indian food so I thought you might want to try it.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,100
That sounds great.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,960
I am craving some type of beef dish.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
Well Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,760
You see cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion so beef is not

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
eaten.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
I see.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,160
So what are we having?

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Chicken?

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,360
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,760
We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,720
It's a bit spicy but I think you can handle it.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Sounds good.

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,080
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Yeah.

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
Also we can have some naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,080
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
rice.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
What about veggies?

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,680
Oh they have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
or dal.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,240
It all sounds so exquisite.

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,360
I can't wait.

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at a couple of words and phrases here on Language

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,960
Takeaway.

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,920
In this first Language Takeaway today, we have words that are about the kinds of food

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
we're eating today.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
So the first one, the character said, I am craving some type of beef.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,360
So to crave something.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,320
Okay so that is a verb, to crave and that means that you have a desire, you really want

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,440
to eat something, to have a particular thing.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,880
That's right but it's particular so it's something specific.

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,640
For example, pregnant women are famous for craving strange foods like pickles.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,880
Yeah exactly.

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,760
So if you say I'm craving some ice cream, you specifically want ice cream or maybe vanilla

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
ice cream.

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,000
Exactly.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,160
And this person wants beef but unfortunately there's no beef at Indian restaurants because

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,440
cows are what?

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,960
Cows are a sacred animal so they are sacred in India.

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,680
Sacred means special or somehow important in a religious way.

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,520
For example, you could say this is a very sacred place so please don't use cameras or

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,200
phones and take your shoes off.

56
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
That's right.

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,440
So the word sacred refers to something that is religious and very important for that religion.

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Especially in this occasion we're talking about the Hindu religion.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,800
Okay so the Hindu religion or Hinduism is a religion that's widely practiced in the

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,560
world and maybe most commonly found in India.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,240
So you'll see a lot of Hindu temples in India and people don't eat beef like we said because

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,800
cows are sacred in the Hindu religion.

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
That's right.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay so now in India or for Indian food, it's common to not use any type of utensil to eat.

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Okay so you might be wondering what is a utensil?

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,480
I know forks, I know spoons.

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,000
Well utensil is the word that describes all forks, spoons and knives, things that you

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,280
eat with.

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,200
Okay so utensils are tools for eating and it's a very general category.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Right exactly.

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,120
So utensils are spoons, forks, knives, everything.

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
Chopsticks are utensils even.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,520
Okay very good.

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,760
And now since we don't use any utensils, you usually eat with your hand and you scoop up

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,080
the food, the rice or the curry.

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,240
Okay to scoop up, this is a verb and usually you use your hands to scoop something.

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,520
So in this case I can use a piece of bread to scoop up or to pick up some food.

78
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
That's right.

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,960
To scoop up, it usually means that you somehow make a little bowl or a little figure with

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,040
your hand so that the liquid or the food will fit inside, kind of like a little scoop.

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,680
Or a little cup, that's right.

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,560
So to scoop up, scoop something up.

83
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Alright so now let's go back, let's review this dialogue and when we come back we're

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:06,880
going to take a look at the specific Indian dishes found in this dialogue.

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
So where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

86
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
It's an Indian restaurant.

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,880
I know you have never had Indian food so I thought you might want to try it.

88
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,480
That sounds great.

89
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,360
I am craving some type of beef dish.

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,860
Well Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,160
You see cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion so beef is not

92
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
eaten.

93
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I see.

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
So what are we having?

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Chicken?

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,760
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,120
We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry.

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,120
It's a bit spicy but I think you can handle it.

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Sounds good.

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,440
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

101
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Yeah.

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,040
We can have some naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven.

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,640
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or

104
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
rice.

105
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
What about veggies?

106
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,080
Oh they have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas

107
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
or dal.

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,640
It all sounds so exquisite.

109
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,520
I can't wait.

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,920
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at those dishes on Language Takeaway Part

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
2.

112
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,120
Oh Marco these lessons are making me so hungry.

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,640
We've been doing them for a couple of weeks now and this one is no exception.

114
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,920
We talked a little bit today about chicken dishes and vegetable dishes but a very general

115
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,080
kind of dish in Indian food is a curry.

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,120
That's right a curry.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,360
Now this is a naan and it's a dish that has a variety of spices in it.

118
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
That's right.

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
So there are many different flavors not just one flavor.

120
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,720
You can have chicken curries and vegetable curries and mutton or lamb curries but the

121
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,840
thing that you need to remember in Indian food is that there's usually different colors

122
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
of curry.

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,160
Red, yellow or green curries.

124
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
That's right.

125
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Exactly.

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,640
So the dishes are usually called curries and an example of a curry we have a chicken tikka

127
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,560
masala curry.

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Okay so we know that there's chicken in it and tikka means that it's grilled chicken

129
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,760
and masala is the name of the spice or the curry, the spice that's in that curry.

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Exactly.

131
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,680
So a curry is kind of like a thick sauce with pieces of chicken in it.

132
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
In this case for the chicken tikka masala.

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,520
It's a little bit spicy and it's a color red.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,640
Alright so we've got the chicken tikka masala or masala and usually you eat this with rice

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,360
or bread but in India there's a special, there are many different kinds of bread but the

136
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,560
special bread we heard today was called naan bread.

137
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,080
Right naan bread and it's just basically a type of bread.

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,560
Now it's not like the bread that you usually have at home.

139
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,140
It's a flat bread so it kind of looks like a pancake almost.

140
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
It does.

141
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
It's not fluffy.

142
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,160
It's flat and the way they cook it is they use this special oven and they cook it inside

143
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
the oven.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,920
Now the question is what is that oven called Marco?

145
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
That's right.

146
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,280
The oven that we heard is a tandoori oven.

147
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,960
Okay so tandoori is just the name of this oven.

148
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,000
It's also a style of cooking in India and it's actually one of my favorite kinds of

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Indian food because you have this, these many different kinds of grilled meats.

150
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,960
You can have tandoori chicken, tandoori mutton, things like that.

151
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Exactly.

152
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,800
So a tandoori oven is a type of oven usually made from clay.

153
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,960
That's why it's called tandoori.

154
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,360
Now towards the end we also have some vegetarian options because as we heard in India they

155
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,040
don't eat beef and many people are also vegetarians.

156
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,080
They don't eat any type of meat at all.

157
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,200
So the first vegetable based dish that we heard is a palak paneer.

158
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,120
That's interesting actually because paneer is curd or like a cheese type of thing.

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,520
So it's usually white and comes in rectangles and paneer you can have many different flavors

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,640
of it but paneer generally is a kind of a cheese, like a cottage cheese.

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
That's right.

162
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,560
And palak is actually spinach so it's a dish that it kind of looks like a thick sauce,

163
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,840
green sauce which is made out of spinach and within it it has little pieces of this type

164
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
of cheese.

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,040
I love this dish.

166
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,820
It's very very delicious.

167
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,320
We also have vegetable samosas.

168
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,640
Now a samosa, what's that?

169
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,800
Now this is a great dish.

170
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,800
This is often used as an appetizer or as a snack.

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,720
You see these on carts or on the street in India.

172
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,640
Now samosas are like pyramids or triangles and inside they have vegetables.

173
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,960
So you can have potatoes and peas or lentils, no not lentils, you can have potatoes and

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,120
peas and they're a little bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and they're

175
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
very tasty.

176
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,840
I guess the equivalent would be to, it's something like an egg roll.

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Like a dumpling.

178
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,680
Like a dumpling because it is deep fried.

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
And we also have dal.

180
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,840
So this is actually a type of lentil as you mentioned.

181
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
That's right.

182
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,720
So dal is a lentil dish and it can be flavored in different ways but basically lentils are

183
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,280
these very very very very small round things.

184
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,240
They're very good for your health.

185
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,080
And dal is a kind of a soupy lentil dish.

186
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
That's right.

187
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,480
So lentil is the category of this type of, I don't know if it's, it's not a grain.

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
It's a legume.

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,800
It's a legume exactly.

190
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,360
So it may sound a little bit weird but we'll post some pictures of different types of lentils

191
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,520
because it's like saying potatoes.

192
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,360
There are many different types of potatoes.

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Sweet potato and all this.

194
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,120
And the same thing goes with lentils.

195
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
So we'll post some pictures so you can see what it looks like.

196
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
But now why don't we go back.

197
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,620
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

198
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's review everything and we'll be right back.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,520
So where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

200
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,280
It's an Indian restaurant.

201
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:17,000
I know you have never had Indian food so I thought you might want to try it.

202
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
That sounds great.

203
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,480
I am craving some type of beef dish.

204
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,980
Well Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

205
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,280
You see cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion.

206
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,840
So beef is not eaten.

207
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
I see.

208
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,680
So what are we having?

209
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Chicken?

210
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

211
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,240
We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry.

212
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,240
It's a bit spicy but I think you can handle it.

213
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Sounds good.

214
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,560
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

215
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Yeah.

216
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,040
We can have some naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven.

217
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,760
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or

218
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
rice.

219
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
What about veggies?

220
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh they have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas

221
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
or dal.

222
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,760
It all sounds so exquisite.

223
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,680
I can't wait.

224
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Alright we're back.

225
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,760
So Indian food has a reputation of being spicy but it's very very delicious.

226
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
That's right.

227
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,520
And you know what people always tell me, at least my Indian friends always tell me, is

228
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,360
that saying Indian food is like saying Chinese food.

229
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,880
We have some general idea but every different part of India has its own special foods.

230
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
That's right.

231
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,760
And so what we get in America at Indian restaurants might not be the same as what we get at Indian

232
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,040
restaurants in India.

233
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,360
So I just want to say that.

234
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,240
But generally you can find these dishes at any Indian restaurants in America.

235
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,920
That's right actually if next time you're in an Indian restaurant or if you ever go,

236
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,000
ask them from what region or what area of India the food is from.

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,560
Because it may be Northern Indian cuisine and obviously that is going to be a little

238
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,520
bit different than maybe the Southern.

239
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,680
I think the Southern is supposed to be spicier.

240
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Exactly.

241
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,280
And it's just like in every country.

242
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,720
Even in our own home countries, maybe the food from the coast or from the North will

243
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
be different from the South or the Inlands.

244
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,800
And I just want to make one more comment.

245
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,240
One of my favorite things to do that many Indian restaurants offer in America is the

246
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,800
lunch buffet.

247
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,960
So a buffet is basically a self-serve of food.

248
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,440
So the restaurant will put out many different dishes and you can take as much as you want

249
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,960
of each but you pay one price.

250
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
So it's $11.99 or something.

251
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,520
That's very, very good.

252
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,280
And yeah, so I often do this when I'm home in the States and I just, you know, I get

253
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,920
to pick my favorite dishes and I eat as much as I want.

254
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,240
And actually I think one other thing that's worth mentioning, we didn't mention in the

255
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,800
dialogue but Indian sweets and the tea is very, very good.

256
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,840
The milk tea that they drink in India is delicious and the sweets are very, very good.

257
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
That's right.

258
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,600
They're famous for being very good and not very healthy for you.

259
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah, exactly.

260
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
They're very sweet.

261
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,700
If you're in an Indian restaurant, take note.

262
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,480
Look for these different things and let us know.

263
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,200
Do you like to eat Indian food?

264
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
If so, what's your favorite dish?

265
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
All right.

266
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,440
So we'll see you guys at our website EnglishPod.com and until next time.

267
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Bye.

268
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:49,000
Bye.
