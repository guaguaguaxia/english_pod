00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,220
My name is Catherine and today we have a lesson that comes actually from a user request.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,220
That's right.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,800
We had a user request who asked us if we can do something about a purchasing manager, maybe

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,360
what his job does or what it is to be a purchasing manager.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,940
So you'll find out all about that today in this lesson.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,960
It's an upper intermediate about being a purchasing manager and about vendors.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,160
So let's check out today's dialogue.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,520
Good morning, Angela.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,320
How have you been lately?

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Morning Michael.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,340
I've been very busy lately.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,360
One of our other vendors is going out of business and I've been searching for a suitable replacement.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,820
Well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Please sit down.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Coffee?

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,820
No thanks.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,360
I've been trying to cut down on the caffeine.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,080
I could never do that.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,220
I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my morning coffee fix.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,940
Let's get down to business then.

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,940
Yes.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,240
I've come to talk with you about ordering the 8 megapixel cameras for our new MiPhone.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,260
The demand for phone cameras is growing and Pear has been falling behind in the market.

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,260
That's great.

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,400
Right now our contract is for the 5 megapixel cameras.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,600
Is Pear still interested in having those?

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
No.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,760
We're changing all the cameras to 8 megapixels.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,960
We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,120
a better deal.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Surely.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,040
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Alright we're back.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,640
So a very interesting job to be a purchasing manager.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,240
A lot of responsibility on top of him.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,240
And we actually saw some really interesting phrases and words that are related to business,

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,920
to negotiating, contracts, etc.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,680
So let's take a look at some of those now on Language Takeaway.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
The first word we have is vendor.

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
This is a noun.

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,480
It means it's a job.

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,200
It's the name of a person's job.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,040
So he is a vendor.

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,960
And a vendor, what does a vendor do?

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,720
Well, a vendor sells things.

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,720
So the verb here is to vend, like a vending machine is that machine that you can buy sodas

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
from.

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
So a vendor is someone who sells things to someone else.

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
Okay so I can say he is a door vendor.

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
He sells doors?

54
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,240
Or let me contact my vendor about the price list for these TVs.

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay, very good.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,840
So we're talking about a vendor who is going out of business.

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,880
And because he's going out of business, this manager is actually looking for a suitable

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
replacement.

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,860
So this is an interesting phrase because these two words normally go together.

61
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,160
We say let's find a replacement, okay that's good, but really we want a suitable replacement.

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,280
And so first of all, the word suitable means like appropriate or good.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
But what about replacement?

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
What does this mean?

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,920
A replacement is something that takes the place of.

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
It replaces something else.

67
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,100
So for example, we have our vendor who went out of business.

68
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,360
So what we are looking now for is another vendor, but not just any vendor, a suitable

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,000
vendor, one that has the things that we need or the prices that we need.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
And in order to replace the one that went out of business.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Right, so we can say this about other things, not just people.

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,080
For example, if I break my iPhone, my cell phone, very expensive phone, I'm upset about

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
it.

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
But when I buy a new one, I don't want a cheap one.

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,640
I want a suitable replacement, one that's about the same as the old one.

76
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
That's right.

77
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,600
So maybe you don't get the exact same one, but you get one that's very similar.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Exactly.

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Okay, very good.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
So now they're going to talk a little bit about the contract, but they kind of do a

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,800
little bit of small talk and they're talking about coffee and he says, well, you know,

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,400
I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my morning coffee fix.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
I know how that feels.

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
This is a person who loves to drink caffeine to wake up.

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,920
And so we talk about a fix as being something that you need.

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay, my coffee fix means the coffee that I drink in the morning to survive.

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
That's right.

88
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay, so we know the verb to fix is to make something good again, to repair.

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,040
But in this case, we're taking fix as a noun and we're saying that it's something that

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,880
you need, like you said, for example, maybe in the morning you need your English fix and

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,280
so you'd listen to EnglishPod.

92
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Exactly.

93
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,560
You need it so much, it's like a drug.

94
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
That's right.

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Very good.

96
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
And moving on, they started to talk a little bit more about the details of the business

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,480
and he mentioned that they want to make this company their sole supplier for cameras.

98
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,720
Okay, so sole means only.

99
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,240
But this word supplier is very interesting because it's very similar to vendor.

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,800
So it's basically someone, a company maybe, or a person that supplies you with what you

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
need.

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
All right, so to supply is to provide for.

103
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,240
So for example, if I work at a clothing store and I sell lots of nice clothing, I need a

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,160
supplier to bring me the clothes that I sell.

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,720
Otherwise, where am I going to get them from?

106
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
I don't have a factory.

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
That's right.

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,320
For example, IBM is one of the biggest computer suppliers or manufacturers in the world.

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
All right.

110
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Okay.

111
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,280
And for the last part of the dialogue, they said, well, I think we can reach an agreement.

112
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,960
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

113
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
They're going to draft a contract.

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,240
All right, so this is interesting because we don't use the verb to write a contract.

115
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Now you would think, well, of course you write it, but there's a special verb that we use

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,400
with the word contract.

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,240
So just remember this phrase together, to draft a contract or my company will draft

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
a contract and send it to you.

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
This means to prepare a contract in order for someone to sign it.

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
That's right.

121
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,480
So it's basically the same as write, but it's usually used more with contracts to draft

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
a contract.

123
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Exactly.

124
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,120
Or maybe you can say to draft up a business plan.

125
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Exactly.

126
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
So to draft a plan, to draft a contract.

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,200
This is basically to write something that has many different points, many different

128
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
strategies.

129
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,320
Okay, very good.

130
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,520
So five key words for you there.

131
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,640
And now let's move on to some key phrases on Fluency Builder.

132
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Fluency Builder.

133
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay, so there are a lot of really, really juicy phrases in today's lesson.

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
The first one is rest assured.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
So we heard this from Michael at the beginning of the dialogue.

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
He said, rest assured that you can count on us.

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
That's right.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Rest assured.

139
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,720
So this is a phrase that you use to try to give confidence to someone, telling them you

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,760
can trust me, rest assured that I'll be there.

141
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Don't worry.

142
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Don't worry.

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,960
So let's hear another example of it.

144
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,120
Rest assured, Marco, I will be there to support you.

145
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay, so I know that you will be there or I can trust that you'll be there.

146
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Okay.

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Very good.

148
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,280
So to rest assure.

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,640
Now the second part of it is in that same sentence, well, rest assure that you can count

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
on us.

151
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,600
Okay, so what does it mean to count on us, to count on me?

152
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,640
So the verb to count has a couple of different meanings and most of us are familiar with

153
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,880
the other one, to count numbers, one, two, three, four, five.

154
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,520
But here to count on someone, remember that preposition on, means to expect someone to

155
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
do something, to depend on someone.

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
That's right.

157
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,040
So if you count on someone, means that you depend on them, you rely on them, you can

158
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,620
trust them.

159
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,080
So for example, in the sentence that I just told Marco, rest assured, I will be there.

160
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
You can count on me.

161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
That means you can depend on me, you can expect me to be there.

162
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
I will not let you down.

163
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
That's right.

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Okay.

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,760
In that same sentence, we have another phrasal verb, rest assured that you can count on

166
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,360
us to be here for the long run.

167
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
The long run.

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
All right.

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,840
So we're not actually running here.

170
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,560
The long run is a phrase that means for a long time.

171
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,160
So for example, if I'm in an interview and someone asks me, well, we're really interested

172
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,760
in your resume and we really like you.

173
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,940
We want to know, are you available in the long run, in the long term?

174
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
That's right.

175
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,120
So if you say, yes, I am here for the long run, it means that you are here for a long

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,600
time.

177
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay.

178
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,860
And let's move on to our next phrase.

179
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,440
And they're actually, you know, they stopped with a small talk and now they want to get

180
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
down to business.

181
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,600
You hear this phrase all the time because you don't just walk into a meeting and start

182
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
talking about business stuff.

183
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,200
You know, you start with the nice things first.

184
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
You say, how was your weekend?

185
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,760
How is your wife?

186
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
How was that game of golf?

187
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,080
So you're talking about nice small talk, like you just said, Marco, but when you want to

188
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,400
start talking about numbers or products, things like that, that is called business.

189
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,760
So when you want to start that, you say, let's get down to business.

190
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
That's right.

191
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
That's right.

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,120
So it's a phrase to say, okay, now let's start talking about what we came here to do.

193
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
Start talking about business.

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,480
And the last phrase that we have for you, it's a very interesting phrase.

195
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,800
When they were talking about one of the brands of phones, they're saying, I'm glad to hear

196
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,760
that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

197
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,240
Now, Marco, I wish I could tell you, I knew where this phrase came from, but I don't.

198
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,040
Let's just talk about the word bandwagon first.

199
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,680
I think bandwagon means something that everyone is doing.

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
That's right.

201
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,040
So I think if everyone likes the color purple and all of a sudden you like the color purple,

202
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,640
then that means you just jumped on the bandwagon.

203
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
All right.

204
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
I jumped on the bandwagon.

205
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,160
So you think of a wagon as like, before they had cars, they had wagons.

206
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,280
They're wooden and they have wheels and they're pulled by a horse.

207
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,120
And so everyone is on there and they're all going somewhere.

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,320
And I wasn't on it, but I jumped on the back.

209
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,880
That means I joined everyone.

210
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,420
I started to do what they're doing.

211
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,420
That's right.

212
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,360
So I guess you agree with them or you're going towards in the same direction that everyone

213
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,520
else is going.

214
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Look at Marco.

215
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
He just bought an iPhone.

216
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,320
Now he's jumped on the bandwagon.

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
That's right.

218
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
So everyone is going in the same direction.

219
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,880
Everyone is doing the same thing.

220
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960
Everyone likes the same thing.

221
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,720
So to jump on the bandwagon, you can use it in the business sense.

222
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,160
For example, if somebody is not agreeing with you or somebody doesn't want to support your

223
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,640
project, you can say, I would really appreciate it if you jumped on the bandwagon and supported

224
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,720
us on this.

225
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
That's right.

226
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,600
So it's not always a bad thing, but remember that the verb that is synonymous with this

227
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
is to conform.

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Okay.

229
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,720
To do what everyone else is doing.

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
That's right.

231
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Okay.

232
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,800
So a lot of interesting things here.

233
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:57,480
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

234
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Good morning, Angela.

235
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,760
How have you been lately?

236
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Morning Michael.

237
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,800
I've been very busy lately.

238
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,840
One of our other vendors is going out of business and I've been searching for a suitable replacement.

239
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,280
Well rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run.

240
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Please sit down.

241
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Coffee?

242
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
No, thanks.

243
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,840
I've been trying to cut down on the caffeine.

244
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,520
I could never do that.

245
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,640
I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my morning coffee fix.

246
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,400
Let's get down to business then.

247
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Yes.

248
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,840
I've come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new Mi

249
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
phone.

250
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,680
The demand for phone cameras is growing and Pear has been falling behind in the market.

251
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
That's great.

252
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

253
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras.

254
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
Is Pear still interested in having those?

255
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
No.

256
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,200
We're changing all the cameras to eight megapixels.

257
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,400
We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate

258
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
a better deal.

259
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Surely.

260
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,720
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,920
So talking about purchasing, it's actually a very interesting position.

262
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,660
I think many, or almost all companies, big companies have this position where not only

263
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,840
do they have to, maybe if they're in retailing, they have to purchase the goods that they

264
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,760
will sell, but also in offices.

265
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,640
For example, who buys the paper, the printers, the copiers, everything for the office?

266
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
That's right.

267
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,960
This is a very important position, as you say, because this person can save a company

268
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,320
a lot of money if the person knows the right vendors.

269
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
That's right.

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,120
If the only vendors you know are selling things at very high prices, then that's not very

271
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,040
good for you or for your business.

272
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,120
But if you know all the inside secrets, you know all the good vendors, then maybe you're

273
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
going to be able to save a lot of money.

274
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
That's right.

275
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,520
I think this position is also a lot broader than just this.

276
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,080
Maybe someone can also help us out on the website, EnglishPod.com.

277
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
You can explain.

278
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Maybe if you're a purchasing manager, you can tell us what your job entails.

279
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,120
Or if you know a purchasing manager, what does that person do?

280
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
That's right.

281
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,480
We're very curious to know, and we hope that you'll be able to use some of these new words

282
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,620
and phrases.

283
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,640
If you want to practice, check us out, EnglishPod.com.

284
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
All right.

285
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
We'll see you guys there.

286
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Thanks.

287
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:39,500
