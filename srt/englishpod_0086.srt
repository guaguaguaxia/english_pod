00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,900
And today we have a special lesson for all of you who are looking for a new apartment

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,020
or house.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,960
Or even if you're not looking for an apartment, this lesson will be useful because it can

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,980
help you describe what your current apartment or house looks like.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,980
That's right.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,920
So we're going to be describing an apartment and other vocabulary related to apartment

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
hunting.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,240
Let's take a look at some of the first words that we have in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,040
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,920
We're going to hear these two words in the dialogue.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,280
The first one is landlord.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Landlord.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Landlord.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,480
All right.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,240
So who is a landlord or what is a landlord?

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Well it's pretty simple.

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,240
A landlord is the person who owns the house.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
Okay.

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Or apartment.

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
So the owner of the house.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Right.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,920
And the landlord rents out the apartment to the tenants.

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Okay.

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Very good.

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Tenants.

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Tenants.

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,200
So the tenants are the people that are renting the apartment or house.

31
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Exactly.

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,560
Two important words that we'll find in the dialogue.

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,140
Tenants and landlord.

34
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,040
So why don't we take a listen to the dialogue now and we'll hear as a couple is checking

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,600
out a new apartment.

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,800
Hi.

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
We are the Christiansons.

38
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
We're here to see the apartment.

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Oh hi.

40
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Sure.

41
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Come on in.

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,520
Well as you can see the place has just been renovated.

43
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,600
The previous tenants left a huge mess here so the landlord has redone everything.

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
It looks great.

45
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,440
It's so bright and airy.

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,680
What great light.

47
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,880
I really love these hardwood floors.

48
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,080
What's the square footage of this place?

49
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Well it's about 120 square meters or 1300 square feet more or less.

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,440
Oh the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

51
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,320
There's a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range.

52
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Really at this price this place is an amazing deal.

53
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I love it.

54
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
But wait.

55
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,640
What are the payment terms?

56
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,000
First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the first of every month.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment it's a very good deal.

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Yes it is.

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,640
Too good to be true.

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,160
The living room and dining room are quite spacious as you can see and down this hall

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,720
here's the master bedroom.

62
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,960
It has a huge walk in closet and an en suite bathroom.

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,760
We can't go in there yet as the police, I mean the clean up crew hasn't finished yet.

64
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,280
What do you mean?

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
What's in here?

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:58,040
Alright so apparently the apartment was too good to be true.

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,160
Yeah I don't think that's exactly what they were expecting to find in the bathroom.

68
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,760
Okay well we did find a lot of great words and phrases so why don't we take a look at

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,360
that now in Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,600
Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,480
We're just gonna look at a bunch of vocabulary items related to apartments and house hunting.

72
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,240
So we've got a lot to cover here so let's get started with the first one.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Renovated.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Renovated.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Renovated.

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Renovated.

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,480
Okay so the verb to renovate.

78
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,640
Great word and I think some examples will help us understand the meaning.

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Example 1.

80
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,240
I had to renovate my kitchen because I accidentally burned everything while cooking.

81
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,600
Example 2.

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:04,000
The city recently renovated the ceiling of the local church.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,240
Example 3.

84
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,560
John is planning on renovating his nightclub so as to make it more modern.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Okay so basically to renovate means to make new again.

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,120
Right, when you renovate a house or an apartment you take everything down and build it back

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
up again.

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,760
Okay so it's usually only used for buildings, for apartments, for houses.

89
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Or offices.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,680
You don't say you renovate your computer.

91
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,160
Yep and also when you just do something really simple like change the paint color, that's

92
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,320
not a renovation.

93
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
That's redecoration.

94
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,440
When you renovate you have to like you know use a hammer and saw and lots of tools.

95
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Change a lot.

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Yep.

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,960
Okay so the apartment was newly renovated and it was bright and airy.

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Airy.

99
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Airy.

100
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
Alright so airy, well I guess we understand the word air, right?

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,880
So if an apartment or something is airy.

102
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,840
It has lots of space.

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,480
Lots of place to move around.

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,400
Okay so it's wide, it's...

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
It's open.

106
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
It's open, okay.

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,760
An open apartment.

108
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,000
Very good.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Now for our next word, an important question she asked for the square footage.

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,320
Square footage.

111
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,400
The square footage of the apartment.

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,920
Okay so we know square foot, right?

113
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,880
So feet like a measure of space.

114
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Right.

115
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
The square footage is just basically the area, how big.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,640
Okay so why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use these two words square footage

117
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,040
in a sentence.

118
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,360
Example one.

119
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,680
As a civil engineer I have to calculate the square footage of the construction site.

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,600
Example two.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,760
Robert is worried that the square footage of this land is not big enough.

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,120
Example three.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,040
If you multiply the width of the room by the length you will have the square footage of

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
the room.

125
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Those are some great examples and I find this, the ending of this word, edge, footage, it's

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
interesting isn't it?

127
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,240
Yeah I guess you can only use it with the imperial system.

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,120
So you can also say tonnage, so how big, how heavy, or mileage.

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,000
But you can't say, for example in meters, you wouldn't say meterage.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,440
No you can't say that.

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,440
So it's not for the metric system, it's only for some units of measurement in the imperial

132
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
system.

133
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
Exactly.

134
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,800
Alright so after we've measured the square footage of the apartment, we saw that they

135
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
had new appliances.

136
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Appliances.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Appliances.

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Appliance.

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,920
So kitchen appliances, what are those?

140
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
Machines that do stuff in the kitchen.

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Alright so a blender, a stove, a microwave.

142
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Yep.

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,120
Or I can say electric appliances.

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
So like your TV, an iron, a vacuum cleaner.

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,720
Okay, so appliance can be any type of machine that's used.

146
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
In a house.

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
In a house.

148
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Yep.

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,480
And well one of these appliances was a professional grade gas range.

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,140
Okay this is a great phrase and I want to break it down.

151
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,400
So a gas range, now this is basically a stove, right?

152
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay.

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
That uses gas instead of electricity.

154
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,640
So I can have an electric range.

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Exactly.

156
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,920
And professional grade, this is something that's really high quality.

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,960
So if it's high quality, why do we say it's professional grade?

158
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,680
Because it's so good that professionals use it.

159
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,080
Okay, so can I only have professional grade kitchen appliances?

160
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,160
No, of course not.

161
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,480
You can have a professional grade anything, like a professional grade carpet for example.

162
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, or a professional grade pickup truck.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,080
Or you can even change this a little bit and say industrial grade.

164
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,960
So after we've seen all the appliances, they describe the house as spacious.

165
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Spacious.

166
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
The house is very spacious.

167
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Pretty easy.

168
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,840
We know the word space here, right?

169
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Right.

170
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400
So obviously this means lots of space.

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
It has lots of space.

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Yeah.

173
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,160
So I guess maybe spacious and airy are a little bit similar, right?

174
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,320
Okay.

175
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,960
And of course, once we were in the master bedroom, we saw that they had a walk-in closet.

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,920
A walk-in closet.

177
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,000
Walk-in closet.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A walk-in closet.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
Right, so this is very easy.

180
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
I guess walk-in.

181
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
You can walk into it.

182
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Right.

183
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,200
And so it's a huge closet, right?

184
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah.

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Now just a note on the spelling here.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Walk-in or hyphenated.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Walk-in closet.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mm-hmm.

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,280
Very good.

191
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,800
And apart from this beautiful closet, we had an en suite bathroom.

192
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
En suite bathroom.

193
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,280
En suite bathroom.

194
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Right.

195
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,680
Another note on the spelling here.

196
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
It's E-N.

197
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Right.

198
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Hyphen.

199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
S-U-I-T-E.

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,520
So even though it's E-N, we pronounce it like an O-N.

201
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Yep.

202
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
En suite.

203
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,640
So an en suite bathroom is a bathroom inside the room.

204
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,400
Okay, inside the master bedroom.

205
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Mm-hmm.

206
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Very good.

207
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
En suite bathroom.

208
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,760
So a lot of great words describing the apartment and also other aspects of real estate.

209
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,800
So why don't we listen to these one more time in context and we'll see how they fit together

210
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,680
to describe an apartment.

211
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,600
Hi, we are the Christiansons.

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
We're here to see the apartment.

213
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Oh, hi.

214
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Sure.

215
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Come on in.

216
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,960
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

217
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,040
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has redone everything.

218
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
It looks great.

219
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,840
It's so bright and airy.

220
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
What great light.

221
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,280
I really love these hardwood floors.

222
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
What's the square footage of this place?

223
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Well, it's about 120 square meters or 1,300 square feet, more or less.

224
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

225
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,780
There's a new dishwasher and a professional-grade gas range.

226
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,640
Really at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

227
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
I love it.

228
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,120
But wait, what are the payment terms?

229
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,400
First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the first of every month.

230
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

231
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,320
Yes, it is.

232
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,080
Too good to be true.

233
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,560
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

234
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,160
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

235
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,400
It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suite bathroom.

236
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,200
We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean, the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
What do you mean?

238
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
What's in here?

239
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:09,040
Alright, so this is always kind of difficult to look for a new apartment and to go and

240
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
see them.

241
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,560
But it's interesting here, they were renting and they had a real estate agent.

242
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,360
Yeah, um, and actually this is very uncommon in America, isn't it?

243
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah, I guess you don't really use a real estate agent unless you're going to buy a

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
house or apartment.

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Mm-hmm.

246
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,160
So when you're renting, you just go and look by yourself.

247
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Right.

248
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,680
You can find ads in the newspaper, on the internet and deal directly with the landlord.

249
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Right.

250
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,800
So after you've done your house hunting and found your apartment, um, you got to set up

251
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
the payment conditions.

252
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Right.

253
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,080
Like we saw in the dialogue, the payment terms were first and last month's rent as deposit.

254
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Mm-hmm.

255
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,200
And that's basically, they'll keep that just in case you damage something in the apartment.

256
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,080
Or have a monster living in your bathroom.

257
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Exactly.

258
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,080
And another thing is that I've noticed in some countries you pay rent in advance.

259
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Right.

260
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,280
So in America, you only pay one month's rent at a time, right?

261
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Right.

262
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,680
So I guess this is an interesting topic, real estate and apartment hunting and renting is

263
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,880
different in different countries.

264
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,120
So that's where you guys need to come and tell us how is, how does this work in your

265
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
country?

266
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,840
You can also use some of the vocabulary in this dialogue to tell us about your apartment.

267
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Right.

268
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
How many rooms do you have?

269
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Bedrooms, dining rooms?

270
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
What's the square footage?

271
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Exactly.

272
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,680
Or how many square meters, right?

273
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Yep.

274
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
So check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

275
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
All right.

276
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
And we'll see you guys there.

277
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
