00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,580
My name is Catherine and today's lesson is an advanced level lesson.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,520
That means we'll be speaking using our normal English tone of voice and using some very,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,160
very difficult vocabulary and phrases.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
So this is really good practice for all of you out there.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
That's right.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,720
We're going to change a little bit the dynamic of how it works.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,960
We're not going to look specifically at language takeaway or fluency builder.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,760
We're going to talk about the topic.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,960
We are going to pick out a couple of different words and phrases that are used in the dialogue,

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,400
but we're mainly going to talk, just have a conversation and you can just listen and

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,120
study a little bit of what we're saying.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,400
So what is the topic today, Marco?

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,240
Well today we're going to talk about the environment, specifically about our carbon footprint.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,440
Okay, that is the title of today's lesson.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,320
I encourage all of you to listen to the context of that phrase and we'll be back in a moment

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:03,560
to talk about what it and some of these other phrases mean.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,760
So what's your guys' take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,440
It's pretty serious, man.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,920
There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,100
earth is heating up.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,480
We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,720
I don't know.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,960
It sounds like a bunch of mumble jumble if you ask me.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,800
The earth will save itself.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,280
It survived the worst disasters in the past.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,160
I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,880
There's no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,640
And we have no bus system.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,340
My house is 40 years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be green

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,960
and energy efficient.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,440
Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either or whether or not it

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,880
was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,000
But you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the West.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,080
I guess.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,000
I think the issue at hand is sustainability.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,800
We've only got this one earth we can live on and our resources are quickly disappearing

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,460
because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,080
but the present.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,760
So like I was saying, we need to change the way we live.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,680
We need to reduce our carbon footprint.

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
But it doesn't have to be that drastic.

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,840
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now.

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,280
And we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either.

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
Though it helps.

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,600
I carpool to work every day with some buddies of mine.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,660
I have a rain barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the summer.

49
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,080
And I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,800
And we just started using biodegradable plastic made from corn oil for takeout orders at my

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
family's restaurant.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
Remember the three R's?

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,160
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,280
Exactly.

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,180
It's just small, simple changes.

56
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,680
Like buying energy-saving light bulbs.

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
Starting a compost bin.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Recycling bottles and papers.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,040
Using reusable water bottles.

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,700
Stop using disposable cups and cutlery.

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,800
Like the ones we're drinking out of?

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah.

63
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,240
Alright, we're back.

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,120
So as you probably guessed, carbon footprint, it's pretty easy.

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,640
You're talking about a footprint is the evidence you leave if you're walking on sand, for example.

66
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Exactly.

67
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,680
And if we talk about carbon, we're talking about the element, right?

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Carbon.

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Yep.

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,160
So carbon is something that is in everything, basically.

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
It's organic.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:49,560
It can also, in the case of a carbon footprint, mean the amount of maybe waste or damage that

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,760
we do to the earth or to the environment.

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Right.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,100
So for example, you're driving your car.

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,520
We all know that the gas that is emitted from the exhaust pipe is CO2, right?

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
And that contains carbon.

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,960
So that's a way of seeing that you're leaving a footprint of carbon.

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,640
You are damaging the atmosphere a little bit by driving your car.

80
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,960
So in talking about a carbon footprint, we talk about having a low carbon footprint,

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,240
which is good, or a very high carbon footprint, which is bad.

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Right.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,880
So there were a lot of interesting things coming up in the dialogue.

84
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,360
One of the first things was...

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,480
Well, the first thing that they're talking about in this dialogue is they're having kind

86
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,040
of an argument about whether or not global warming and global climate change really exists.

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,280
Yeah, this is a very interesting part because some people say, well, global warming is happening,

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
global warming is real.

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,360
And other people say, well, it's not real.

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not really a problem.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,120
This is just a phase that the earth will go through and like everything, it'll disappear.

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,080
Well, I agree with people who say that the earth goes through phases because sometimes

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,600
there are centuries that are hotter and sometimes there are centuries that are colder.

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,540
But I think it's undeniable that there has been a large and immediate global climate

95
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,760
change in the last maybe 20 years.

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,680
Yeah, we're definitely speeding up maybe that cycle, right?

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Exactly.

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,440
And I think that's great evidence of this and terrible evidence of this is the three

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,920
earthquakes, massive earthquakes that have happened in the last couple of months.

100
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,480
I think that earthquakes like last year and like this year are really, really important

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,560
reminders that we do as humans influence the way that the world responds to us.

102
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,600
I think I always see it as the earth kind of just shaking its back, kind of saying,

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
get off me.

104
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Stop it.

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Stop it.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
That itches.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Yeah, exactly.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,640
That's the way I see earthquakes sometimes.

109
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,960
But when they were talking about, well, is it real?

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Is it not?

111
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,640
They use a really interesting phrase and says, it sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

112
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Mumbo jumbo.

113
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,520
So this is a way to say that sounds like a bunch of garbage or it sounds like a bunch

114
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680
of gibberish.

115
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,920
It sounds like a bunch of people are talking about something that doesn't really exist.

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,080
So mumbo jumbo is basically something that's not really real or true.

117
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,200
I think don't you also, can you use it as somebody that's saying something you don't

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
really understand?

119
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Right.

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,920
So if maybe I'm talking to you about something that's very academic and very scholarly, you

121
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,560
say, eh, sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo to me.

122
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Exactly.

123
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
So that's what the person said.

124
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,480
Ah, you know, the environmental problems are a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

125
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,880
But it was really interesting because they were like, well, we have to save the earth

126
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,640
and well, and then there was actually a phrase here that was really kind of hard for me to

127
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,640
understand when the person said, I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.

128
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Boonies.

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,960
So what does it mean by living in the boonies?

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,000
This is a very common word to hear in spoken English, especially with young people.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,160
Boonies means we live far away from civilization.

132
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
We live far away from cities.

133
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,160
We live far away from everything.

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,000
So maybe these people live in the countryside or in a small village and they don't feel

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,360
like they're affected by what people in the big cities do.

136
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Okay.

137
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
So if you say, oh, I live in the boonies, you're just saying, I live really far, really

138
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
far away.

139
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,840
So this is a very common American word.

140
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,480
I think you can also say boondocks, which is like that movie Boondock Saints.

141
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,560
But boondocks and boonies means very far away.

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,680
So I could say, Marco, I'm not going to drive out to your house for a party.

143
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,080
You live in the boonies.

144
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Do you have any other ways that you can say that you live really far away?

145
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
You live in Egypt.

146
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,040
You live in Egypt, which for us in America is obviously very, very far away.

147
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Sometimes we say, oh, the youngs, exactly.

148
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
People in New Zealand say that.

149
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,000
I've also heard people say, oh, you live where the wind turns around.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Really?

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I like that one.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
It's like you live so far.

153
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Oh God, you live where the wind turns around.

154
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
The end of the earth.

155
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Exactly.

156
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Wow.

157
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,640
So, well, there are a lot of different ways of saying that.

158
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,360
So they were talking about different aspects of the environment, like that we heard the

159
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360
word green or energy efficient.

160
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Okay.

161
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,680
So basically what they're doing is they're talking about some of the things they've heard

162
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,240
in the media, maybe, or on TV about what people are supposed to be doing.

163
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
These are very abstract.

164
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,000
That means these are very kind of big terms.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,360
Go green or be more energy efficient.

166
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Yeah.

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,440
I've heard this, like, for example, when people say, oh, you have to be more green or go green.

168
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,480
That means more friendly towards the ecosystem, right?

169
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
That's right.

170
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,400
So this is a very general suggestion and we can talk about specifics in a minute, but

171
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,760
this is a very general suggestion for thinking about the environment and doing things to

172
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,920
help it.

173
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,440
And so go green or be green is a way to be more environmentally friendly.

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,440
We also have using energy efficient computers or light bulbs or TVs.

175
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
The third thing that they talk about, and this is something that comes up a lot, is

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
sustainability.

177
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,080
Yeah, that's a big word that a lot of people like to use in this type of topic, sustainability.

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Right.

179
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
So sustainability comes from the word to sustain.

180
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,640
That means to hold out over time or to continue.

181
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:05,840
So you think about something, maybe sustainability is, I think, in many cases about doing or

182
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,520
having habits, doing things that you can continue to do for a long time.

183
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,280
For example, driving a big SUV to work every day is not keeping in mind sustainability

184
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,660
because one day there will be no oil.

185
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
So then what do we do?

186
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Right.

187
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,640
So that's not a sustainable action.

188
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,200
Sustainable actions mean that we have less negative impact on the world.

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Right.

190
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,560
So basically what you're trying to do is to sustain, which means to hold, to withstand

191
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,960
these habits, for example.

192
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,080
So when you talk about a sustainable ecosystem, it means that it has everything it needs and

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
it can continue to work for a very, very long time.

194
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Right.

195
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,760
So you can also talk about sustainable development, which we talk about in aid and giving aid

196
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,840
to other countries.

197
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,480
So sustainable development is trying to help other countries or other people in ways that

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,080
they can continue to do for a long time.

199
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
It's also very popular with tourism.

200
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
They talk about sustainable tourism.

201
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Right.

202
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,080
That means thinking about the environment and having tourism that can last forever,

203
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,480
not tourism that will destroy the environment because it's very harmful.

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
It's a very interesting topic.

205
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,240
And as you say, it's used in a wide range of cases, sustainable development, sustainable

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,840
projects, sustainable tourism.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,320
There are a lot of different ways that people use this, but it's basically the same thing.

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Right.

209
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
It's in essence, it refers to that.

210
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Yes.

211
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Keeping something going over time.

212
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,400
But I think the big question here is if you want to go green, if you want to be environmentally

213
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,520
friendly, what do you do?

214
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,920
Because it's not about big ideas.

215
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,960
It's about specifics.

216
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,840
It's about changing your everyday actions.

217
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Right.

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
So these guys had a couple of ideas.

219
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah.

220
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,200
They came up with something like, for example, hybrid vehicles, which is a big thing now.

221
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,120
Basically hybrid means two, right?

222
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,680
It's a combination of two or more.

223
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
That's right.

224
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,880
So, you know the Sphinx in Egypt?

225
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
That's a hybrid.

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Right.

227
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,240
Between a man and a lion.

228
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Exactly.

229
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Right.

230
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,240
So a hybrid vehicle basically uses gasoline, but also electricity.

231
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,440
So they're actually very efficient because-

232
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
And they're quiet.

233
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,720
They're quiet.

234
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,380
And usually where you use up most of your gasoline is in traffic.

235
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,360
Because your car is on, you're accelerating, you're braking, you're accelerating, you're

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
braking.

237
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,600
So in this case, I think hybrid vehicles run on the electric engine until they hit, I think

238
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,200
it's 30 miles per hour.

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,400
And once you surpass that, then it switches to the gas engine, which obviously if you

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,240
have a constant high speed, it's more efficient, the combustion of the gasoline.

241
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Exactly.

242
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
So a good example of a hybrid vehicle is the Toyota Prius.

243
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Right.

244
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,720
I think it was like the first one commercially available.

245
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,920
But now they have all kinds and they're actually trying to make entirely electric cars.

246
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
So lots of things to watch out for there.

247
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,620
But they also talked about something for the house, right?

248
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,080
So if you want to not just have a nice car that is environmentally friendly, but also

249
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,640
to do things with your house, what can you put on your roof?

250
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,280
I think we've seen a lot of these.

251
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,560
These are called solar panels.

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,180
Solar has to do with the sun.

253
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,240
So solar power, solar panel, that means energy that comes from the sun.

254
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,660
So the sun.

255
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,520
And a panel is like a pad or like some kind of device that can take the energy from the

256
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
sun.

257
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Yeah.

258
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
It's really, really good.

259
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,080
Basically, in some places you have anywhere between eight to 12 hours of sunlight.

260
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,300
So the whole day, these panels are absorbing energy.

261
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,960
You can store them maybe in batteries and then just use them later.

262
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,800
So basically you don't really need to use electricity that comes from coal or from nuclear

263
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,880
power plants because you want to turn on a light.

264
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,240
It doesn't really use up a lot of electricity.

265
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
And there's no waste.

266
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
And there's no waste.

267
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
It's all clean.

268
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,880
So my question for you, does Ecuador have a lot of solar panels everywhere?

269
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,720
Because you guys have so much sunlight down there.

270
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
We don't really have a lot of them.

271
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,140
It's not a big commercial thing yet, but there are a lot of projects going around to help

272
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,800
implement these things a lot better.

273
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,720
For example, taking these technologies to the countryside where people don't have access

274
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,200
to electricity by means of cables.

275
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,640
So they're implementing that there, getting them to use it.

276
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
But it's still expensive.

277
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,360
That's the problem with solar panels is that, of course, it's an energy efficient way of

278
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
going.

279
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,720
It'll save you money in the long run, but up front, you've got to spend a lot of money.

280
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,140
Well, here's a good way to use sustaining.

281
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,200
If someone in the countryside has solar panels in their house, it's a self-sustaining way

282
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
to produce energy.

283
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Exactly.

284
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,760
So you can spend on another place or a person.

285
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Exactly.

286
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Actually, this is a very popular thing in many developed countries.

287
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,680
I remember when I was living in Chile, big buildings were being marketed as energy efficient

288
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,400
and green by showing that they can be self-sustaining.

289
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,520
So basically, they would have solar panels on the roof.

290
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,640
They would collect sunlight all day, and then they had big batteries that would store this

291
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,200
energy and then you can use it.

292
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,400
They were more efficient into keeping heat or keeping the cold.

293
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,480
And also, what we saw in the vocab, they also had rain barrels.

294
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,920
So basically, collecting water from the rain, and then they can use this water, obviously,

295
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,080
through a filtering system in order to be able to drink it or to wash your clothes and

296
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
stuff.

297
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,040
But basically, they would say that it could reduce your carbon footprint by more than

298
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,360
50% and also the amount of money you would spend because you wouldn't spend so much money

299
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,760
on water, you wouldn't spend so much money on electricity or gas and things like this.

300
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
That's awesome.

301
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,040
Well, one of the biggest concerns as far as environmentalism is water, where water will

302
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,720
come from in 50 years because there is a limited amount of fresh water in the world.

303
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,040
And if we can reuse rainwater and collect it, I think it's brilliant.

304
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,040
So a barrel basically is like a big container, circular.

305
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,320
It's like a circle and it stands up on the ground or on a roof.

306
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,360
And it's brilliant because if you have a rain barrel that collects all this rain, and you

307
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,640
have solar panels, basically, you don't need gas or electricity to take a warm shower.

308
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,000
You just have the solar panels that can heat up the rain barrel water and there you have

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
a warm shower.

310
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It sounds so nice.

311
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,580
You have sun-kissed warmth and you have fresh rainwater.

312
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,720
But the whole water issue is a very popular topic.

313
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,880
I recommend that any of our listeners read.

314
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,040
There's a very interesting article that talks about don't worry about petroleum running

315
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
out in 50 years.

316
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,040
We're probably going to run out of our water before that.

317
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:48,360
And they project droughts and huge famine in places like India, like in the Middle East,

318
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,840
even in places of China.

319
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Really?

320
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Yeah.

321
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Well, not to scare anyone.

322
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,880
But yeah, it's interesting reading though.

323
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Yeah, it's really good.

324
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Very serious stuff.

325
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,280
Well, the last thing that I think we should talk about before we listen to today's audio

326
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,920
file again is the compost bin.

327
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,160
Now, this is maybe something that's hard to understand for someone who's never seen one

328
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
before.

329
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,840
But basically, compost is, well, the verb is compost, to compost, but it's also a noun.

330
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,880
But a lot of people, they don't want to throw away their food and their organic material,

331
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,720
things like flowers and food and biodegradable things.

332
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,920
They actually reuse them.

333
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,400
They have a space in the backyard of the house where they throw away all the old food.

334
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,360
Nothing plastic, nothing non-biodegradable.

335
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,760
And that over time turns into fertilizer or mulch for their gardens.

336
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,160
So basically, you're putting it back into the earth.

337
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Yeah.

338
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,360
No, this is a very good option.

339
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:58,000
And I remember seeing that even in Brazil, they have huge compost bins or compost places

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,080
that they fill up with this garbage.

341
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,160
And obviously, things that decompose start to emit methane gas.

342
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,480
So they've found a way to harness this gas, transport it through tubes, and start using

343
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
it.

344
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,520
So actually having gas stoves with this methane gas.

345
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
That's brilliant.

346
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,400
So two uses, fertilizer and methane gas.

347
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Yeah.

348
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,840
So there are a lot of options there to go green, to do your part to help the earth.

349
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Wow.

350
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,600
So let's listen again to the dialogue that we had today.

351
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,240
Hopefully we've cleared up some of the things that were confusing for you, and we'll be

352
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:41,960
back in just a moment.

353
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,160
So what's your guys' take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?

354
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
It's pretty serious, man.

355
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,320
There have been tons of scientific studies, and the scientific community says that the

356
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,500
earth is heating up.

357
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,880
We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.

358
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
I don't know.

359
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,360
It sounds like a bunch of mumble jumble if you ask me.

360
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
The earth will save itself.

361
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,680
It's survived the worst disasters in the past.

362
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,560
I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.

363
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,920
There's no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter.

364
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,000
And we have no bus system.

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,720
My house is 40 years old, and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be green

366
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,360
and energy efficient.

367
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,800
Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either, or whether or not it

368
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,240
was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through.

369
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,360
But you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the West.

370
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
I guess.

371
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,360
I think the issue at hand is sustainability.

372
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,160
We've only got this one earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing

373
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,820
because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything

374
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,440
but the present.

375
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
So like I was saying, we need to change the way we live.

376
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,040
We need to reduce our carbon footprint.

377
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,480
But it doesn't have to be that drastic.

378
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,200
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now.

379
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,640
And we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either,

380
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
though it helps.

381
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,960
I carpool to work every day with some buddies of mine.

382
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,020
I have a rain barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the summer.

383
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,440
And I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.

384
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,160
And we just started using biodegradable plastic made from corn oil for takeout orders at my

385
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
family's restaurant.

386
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
Remember the three R's?

387
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,520
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

388
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,680
Exactly.

389
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,560
It's just small, simple changes.

390
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,080
Like buying energy-saving light bulbs.

391
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
Starting a compost bin.

392
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,700
Recycling bottles and papers.

393
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,520
Using reusable water bottles.

394
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Stop using disposable cups and cutlery.

395
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,360
Like the ones we're drinking out of?

396
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Yeah.

397
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,000
All right, we're back.

398
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,400
So it's a very interesting topic, very debatable.

399
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,600
We have Earth Day coming up, I think.

400
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,560
You have to turn off your lights for an hour.

401
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
That's right.

402
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Earth Hour, Earth Day.

403
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,080
So remember, reduce, reuse, recycle.

404
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
The three R's.

405
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,000
Think about the way that you use things and try and reuse them if you can.

406
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,120
It's a very good topic.

407
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,960
We want to know what you think about it.

408
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,360
And also if you have any suggestions or any comments about future advanced lessons, why

409
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
don't you tell us?

410
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,800
Come to EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

411
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Bye.
