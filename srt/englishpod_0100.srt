00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,960
Welcome back to another lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,960
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,120
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,440
And today we are going to have a very casual, normal conversation.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,440
That's right.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,800
We're going to listen in on some small talk between a taxi driver and the passenger.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Small talk.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
So that's basically...

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Mm, small, short conversations you have with someone that you don't know very well.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Okay.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,040
And you can ask them simple questions like how old are you, where you're from, etc.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
That's right.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,520
And this can be really hard for English learners because they often don't know what the right

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,800
thing to say or the right thing to talk about.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,480
So we're going to give you a lot of phrases in this lesson that you can use in small talk.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Okay.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,520
So we don't have anything to preview today.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:58,320
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Where to, miss?

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Hi.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,000
Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,360
Sure thing.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,680
So where are you flying in from?

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,960
From China.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,220
Really?

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,840
You don't look very Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so.

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
It's fine.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
I am actually from Mexico.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,600
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
products.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Wow, sounds interesting.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,720
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
Don't get me wrong.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,240
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

37
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,800
Well, thank you.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,320
In that case, I am 26 years old.

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,360
And what about yourself?

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old US of A, although I have some

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
Colombian heritage.

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Really?

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
That's great.

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Do you speak Spanish?

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
Yeah, of course.

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,040
¡Qué bien! Entonces podemos hablar en español.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,560
Alright, so I don't think this guy spoke much Spanish, do you?

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
No, even though he has Colombian heritage, I think he doesn't speak much.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
But maybe he's just a little bit rusty.

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Maybe.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,560
But what he does speak is English.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
And since this is EnglishPod, why don't we look at some of the phrases that they used

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,040
for small talk in Fluency Builder?

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Fluency Builder.

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Alright, so today on Fluency Builder, we're going to take a look at phrases that both

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
the passenger and the taxi driver used to make small talk.

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
So why don't we start with the first one?

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,040
Alright, so the taxi driver tells the passenger that she doesn't look very Chinese if you

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,720
don't mind me saying so.

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,000
Right, so he said, you don't look very Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
If you don't mind me saying so.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,400
So what does he mean by this last part of his sentence?

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Well this is a phrase that we use to soften a statement that might be a little bit rude.

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
She could be Chinese, right?

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,680
So it may be a little bit rude to say that, but he kind of apologizes.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
That's right.

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,320
By saying, if you don't mind me saying so.

68
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,200
Okay, so for example, I could say, hey Marco, you look a little tired today if you don't

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
mind me saying so.

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
Okay, so does it always go at the end?

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,620
You could use it at the beginning.

72
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,760
If you don't mind me saying so, I just don't think this is a good idea.

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
Okay, very good.

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,440
So you can use this phrase in the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,600
Right, and it makes your statement a little bit less rude.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,880
If you don't mind me saying so.

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,040
Now again, he also apologizes a little bit when he says, excuse me if I am being a bit

78
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
nosy, but.

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but.

80
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,320
Okay, so let's take a look at this.

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Nosy, what's this?

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, when somebody is nosy, it means they are very curious.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
They are asking too many questions.

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
Yeah, asking more questions than they should ask.

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,360
Right, so he apologizes and says, well, excuse me if I'm asking too many questions, and then

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,960
he asks her another question.

88
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,720
He asks her how old she is.

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,920
Right, so again, it's a polite way of maybe asking a question that might be a little bit

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
sensitive.

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Yeah, or a little bit impolite.

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,400
Okay, so of course, asking a woman her age maybe is a little bit impolite, right?

93
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Yes, typically women don't like that too much.

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,200
But our next phrase, we heard the taxi driver say, don't get me wrong.

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
Don't get me wrong.

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Don't get me wrong.

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,640
Okay, so don't get me wrong.

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,560
He says, well, don't misunderstand what I'm saying.

99
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
That's right.

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,000
This phrase is used so commonly in English that I think it would help us to hear some

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,560
examples.

102
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
Example one.

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Don't get me wrong.

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
It's not that I think you stole my computer.

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,040
It's just that you were the only one who could get into my room.

106
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Example two.

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,960
I do have a few problems with the plan, but don't get me wrong.

108
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,840
I still think it's a good idea.

109
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Example three.

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,920
Don't get me wrong.

111
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
I think John's a nice guy.

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
He's just a bit disorganized.

113
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
All right, very good example.

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,640
So don't get me wrong, right?

115
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
That's right.

116
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,240
And now for the final phrase on putting it together today.

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Well, the passenger, the woman says her age, she says, I'm 26 years old.

118
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,480
And what about yourself?

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
What about yourself?

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
What about yourself?

121
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
All right.

122
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
Now, this sentence isn't very correct, actually, right?

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,540
Yeah, technically, it's not correct in grammar, but it is used so commonly every day by American

124
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,200
English speakers that we thought we'd show it to you.

125
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Okay, so you would say, I am 26 years old and what about you?

126
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
That's right.

127
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,560
Okay, but commonly you will hear people say, what about yourself?

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,760
And if you use this, you'll sound really fluent and really native like.

129
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,200
Okay, very good.

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,940
So what about yourself?

131
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,880
So again, it's just like, what about you?

132
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,520
So I could say, hey, Marco, I'm going away on holiday this weekend.

133
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
And what about yourself?

134
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,560
Okay, what about yourself?

135
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
So we've taken a look at these four phrases on putting it together.

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,160
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time?

137
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,520
We're going to slow it down a little bit, and then we'll come back and take a look at

138
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:27,600
some vocabulary words on Language Takeaway.

139
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
Where to miss?

140
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,200
Hi, Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Sure thing.

142
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,040
So where are you flying in from?

143
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
From China.

144
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Really?

145
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,040
You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

146
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,200
It's fine.

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,840
I am actually from Mexico.

148
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,080
I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom

149
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
products.

150
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,760
Wow, sounds interesting.

151
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

152
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,080
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

153
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Don't get me wrong.

154
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,040
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

155
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,520
Well, thank you.

156
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,320
In that case, I am 26 years old.

157
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,160
And what about yourself?

158
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,960
I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old US of A, although I have

159
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,240
some Colombian heritage.

160
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Really?

161
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,120
That's great.

162
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,560
Do you speak some Spanish?

163
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,760
Yeah, of course.

164
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,800
¡Qué bien!

165
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,680
Entonces podemos hablar en español.

166
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Well, we've got some interesting vocabulary words and phrases here in Language Takeaway.

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,560
And the first one...

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,080
Well, after she gets in the taxi and tells him where she wants to go, he answers by saying

169
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
sure thing.

170
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Sure thing.

171
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Sure thing.

172
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Sure thing.

173
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
So, if I say, yeah, sure thing, what does that mean?

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,840
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

175
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Example one.

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,880
Do you mind lending me a hundred bucks?

177
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,760
Sure thing.

178
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Example two.

179
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,080
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day?

180
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,400
Sure thing.

181
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Example three.

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Do you mind lending me a hundred bucks?

183
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Sure thing.

184
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day?

185
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
Sure thing.

186
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Example four.

187
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Can you get some milk on the way home?

188
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Sure thing.

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm on my way now.

190
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,280
Okay, so sure thing, basically, yeah, no problem or okay.

191
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Or I'll do it.

192
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
I'll do it.

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
It's fine.

194
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,560
So, it's a very common way you will hear this a lot when somebody agrees or says yes, no

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
problem.

196
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,760
Yeah, and again, it will help you sound really native-like to use this phrase.

197
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,120
Well, the next one, the taxi driver says, I was born and raised here.

198
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,840
I was born and raised here.

199
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Born and raised.

200
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:28,120
Okay, so this is a way of saying I was born in this country and I haven't left this country.

201
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
That's right.

202
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
So, I'm from this country.

203
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Okay.

204
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
Born and raised here in the good old US of A.

205
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,520
Good old US of A. The good old US of A.

206
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,760
So, this is a pretty interesting way of saying America.

207
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Right.

208
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,400
It's actually more of a phrase, right?

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,280
The good old US of A. Yep.

210
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Okay.

211
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,960
So, it means the good United States of America.

212
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,280
Yeah, it's kind of a fond way or a friendly way of describing America.

213
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,760
All right.

214
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
And we have one more word for language takeaway.

215
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,280
Well, the taxi driver was talking about his Colombian heritage.

216
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Colombian heritage.

217
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Heritage.

218
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
All right.

219
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,920
So, if I have Colombian heritage, what does that mean?

220
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,800
Your grandmother or, you know, grandfather, great-grandmother or someone in your family

221
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,280
is from Colombia.

222
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Okay.

223
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,160
And what about the word heritage by itself?

224
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Yeah, so your heritage is basically your culture, your...

225
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Customs.

226
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,840
Yeah, your customs, your history.

227
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Okay.

228
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
So, heritage.

229
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,880
A country rich in heritage.

230
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,520
Lots of good old historical culture in that country.

231
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Okay.

232
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Very good.

233
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,520
So, now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the last time.

234
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Now we can understand all these phrases and these great words that we've just looked at.

235
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,840
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

236
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Where to, miss?

237
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Hi.

238
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,480
Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

239
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,160
Sure thing.

240
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
So, where are you flying in from?

241
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,480
From China.

242
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Really?

243
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,360
You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

244
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
It's fine.

245
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
I am actually from Mexico.

246
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,080
I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom

247
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
products.

248
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Wow, sounds interesting.

249
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,040
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

250
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

251
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
Don't get me wrong.

252
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,760
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

253
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,320
Well, thank you.

254
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,840
In that case, I am 26 years old.

255
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,880
And what about yourself?

256
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old US of A.

257
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Although, I have some Colombian heritage.

258
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Really?

259
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
That's great.

260
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Do you speak Spanish?

261
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah, of course.

262
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
¡Qué bien!

263
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Entonces podemos hablar en español.

264
00:11:48,360 --> 00:12:02,280
So, Marco, this taxi driver makes a bit of a mistake when he asks the woman how old

265
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
she is.

266
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,160
Yes, yeah, exactly.

267
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,040
There are a couple of questions that in some cultures are considered to be normal and okay,

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,360
but in other cultures, they're not really well accepted.

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Okay, so in Anglo culture, for example, it's really impolite to ask a woman how old she

270
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
is.

271
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Right.

272
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,720
Women are a little bit more sensitive about their age.

273
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,880
Others aren't so much, but it's usually better to just not ask.

274
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Yep.

275
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,000
And what else should we avoid talking about in Small Talk?

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,680
Well, for example, when you ask a person their occupation, you can ask what they do for a

277
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,600
living, but don't ask how much money they make.

278
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
That's right.

279
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
Anglo people are really sensitive about talking about money.

280
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,800
We hate talking about money.

281
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Right.

282
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
So, don't ask somebody their salary or how much money they make.

283
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,240
It's just not considered to be polite.

284
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,120
And another good one to be careful of is asking if someone is married or not.

285
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Right.

286
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,200
Sometimes you're just being friendly and you want to know if that person has family or

287
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,560
something, but you have to be careful when and where you ask this question.

288
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Right.

289
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,680
If they've mentioned their family, if they've talked about their kids or something else

290
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,240
to do with their family, then it's okay.

291
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Right.

292
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,720
You can say, well, oh, how long have you been married?

293
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Yeah.

294
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,320
But if a guy asks a girl, oh, are you married?

295
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,000
It kind of sounds like maybe he's interested in her or that he's trying to come on to

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
her and to be maybe more than friendly, right?

297
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
That's right.

298
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Okay.

299
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
