00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,320
My name is Kathryn and we're going to the gym today, right Marco?

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
That's right.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,240
Today we're going to go to the gym and we're going to try to lose weight or to get in shape.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,180
So before we start out though, there is a phrasal verb that we should take a look at.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,640
So today in Vocabulary Preview, we're looking at this phrase, to work out or working out.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
That's right.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,160
So when we go to the gym, this is what we do.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,280
We go there to work out, to exercise or to tone up.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,140
This is just a way of saying that I'm going to go somewhere like a gym to exercise myself.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,140
That's right.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,860
So with that in mind, we're going to go to the gym, we're going to work out and we're

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:54,040
going to learn a lot of words today about what exactly goes on in the gym.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,640
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
I can't.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I have to go to the gym.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Come on.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
You can go tomorrow.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Just skip it today.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,160
Actually, I will.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
That's cool.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,640
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,520
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
build.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
Like for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,240
me work out with free weights.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,960
Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,480
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,520
All right.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,720
So, now we're back.

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,400
Let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
All right.

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,440
First of all, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot about this person called a personal

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
trainer.

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,400
What does a personal trainer do, Marco?

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,000
So basically, you have a person that is your coach, the person that guides you and teaches

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
you how to work out or what you should do.

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
All right.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,360
So, personal means it's just for me.

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,080
This person is only helping me.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,840
A trainer is someone who, like you say, gives me guidance.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,960
So personal trainer is someone who will work with me every day or maybe one time a week

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,200
to really get the most out of my workout.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
That's right.

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,160
So that is a personal trainer.

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,080
And as we said, he's going to help us to build muscle.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,800
We want to build muscle when we go to the gym.

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
All right.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,000
So, this is an interesting one because the verb is not to grow or to make.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,120
The verb is to build.

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,680
So, I have muscles, but I want my muscles to get bigger.

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,840
So I go to build muscles at the gym.

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,880
You might even hear this phrase, a bodybuilder.

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,720
So this idea that you make them.

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,760
Yeah, exactly.

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
So you don't get muscle.

63
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,380
You don't create muscle.

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,040
You build muscle.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,800
And alongside with muscles, not only do you get them big, but you also get muscle tone.

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
All right.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,620
So muscle tone basically means definition.

68
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,200
So maybe before you start to work out, your body is very soft.

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
You can't see the muscles.

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, when you start to see those muscles, you see the lines in your body.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,320
Your skin gets tighter, not so soft.

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,840
That's called muscle tone.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
That's right.

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,160
So then you can see the muscles.

75
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,400
That's muscle tone.

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
And now the muscles that we most commonly go to the gym to work out, we're going to

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,440
name really quickly and we're going to see where they are.

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,840
So the first one that we mentioned were abs.

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Okay.

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
This is an important one, especially if you want to go to the beach.

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,960
The abs are located on your stomach.

82
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,920
So you see those kind of rectangles, those squares on your stomach.

83
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Those are the abs.

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
That's right.

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,680
And now for guys also, we want to work out our pecs or our pectoral muscles.

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,440
So those are on your chest, below your neck, but above your stomach.

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
That's right.

88
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
And another important one on your arm, we have our biceps.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
All right.

90
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,880
Men usually like to show these off, or at least boys do.

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
These are on your arms.

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,760
So you know when you make that L shape with your arm and you squeeze like Popeye?

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,320
Those are your biceps.

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Those are your biceps.

95
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Exactly.

96
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,760
And now, obviously going down towards our legs now, we have our quad muscles, our quads.

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
All right.

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,120
So those are on the top part of your legs, right Marco?

99
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
In front.

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
In front.

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,560
So like on the top of your thigh.

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Exactly.

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,440
And now right behind the back part of your leg, you have your hamstrings.

104
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,400
Hamstring.

105
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,520
Now you hear about this one a lot because people injure their hamstrings pretty easily

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
in football or in running.

107
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Yeah, that's right.

108
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,800
Sometimes if you're running and you didn't stretch, your muscles are not warm, you can

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
pull a hamstring.

110
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
All right.

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
So that hamstring is an important one.

112
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
We have one more.

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
That's right.

114
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,080
We have our calves and these are in the bottom, right above our feet.

115
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,680
So I don't have any muscles except for this one because I ride my bike.

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
And when you ride your bike, this gets big.

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,920
So your calves are that part of your leg above your foot, but below your knee in the back.

118
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
That's right.

119
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
The back part.

120
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Very good.

121
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,720
So all of these muscles, some of the most common ones that we work out.

122
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:19,560
So now let's move on to some important phrases on Fluency Builder.

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,120
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I can't.

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I have to go to the gym.

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Come on.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
You can go tomorrow.

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Just skip it today.

129
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,600
Actually, I will.

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

132
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,880
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
That's cool.

134
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Yeah.

136
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,040
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to

137
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
build.

138
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,120
Like, for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs, and biceps, he

139
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
makes me work out with free weights.

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Then for my quads, calves, and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,360
Sounds like you're really getting into shape.

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,820
So the beginning of the dialogue, the friends were trying to decide what to do.

143
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,280
And one friend said, do you want to go catch a movie?

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
That's right.

145
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,440
So to catch a movie.

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,800
Do you want to go catch a movie?

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,320
It sounds funny because catch means to hold something in your hands after someone throws

148
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
it.

149
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
So throw and catch.

150
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,720
But here, it doesn't mean to actually hold something in your hands.

151
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,400
It means do you want to go see a movie?

152
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Right.

153
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Exactly.

154
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,360
So it's a very informal, colloquial way of saying, hey, do you want to go to the movies?

155
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
Do you want to go see a movie?

156
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,000
Maybe not like a serious date or something, just for fun.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Do you want to go catch a movie?

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
That's right.

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Let's go catch a movie.

160
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
All right.

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,960
So obviously we can't go to the movies because we got to go to the gym.

162
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,280
And we have to go to the gym because our personal trainer will get on our case.

163
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,520
The personal trainer will get on my case if I don't go.

164
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
All right.

165
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,480
So someone will get on my case if I don't do this.

166
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,120
So this is an interesting way of saying, my personal trainer will criticize me or will

167
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,240
be angry with me if I don't do this.

168
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
That's right.

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,260
So you can use it with, for example, your parents.

170
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,160
Your parents are always getting on your case because you don't clean your room.

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Yeah.

172
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,080
My mom gets on my case when I don't tell her where I'm going when I go out.

173
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,200
So that means to criticize, to give you a hard time, to get angry at you or even maybe

174
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
yell at you.

175
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,260
But you can change the pronoun.

176
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,880
So he gets on my case, but I can get on your case.

177
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
That's right.

178
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,160
So remember that someone gets on someone else's case.

179
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,660
That's where the person goes.

180
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,720
And of course, if you want to tell that person to stop bothering you, you just say, get off

181
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
my case.

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
All right.

183
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,960
So he's on her case.

184
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,320
Get off my case.

185
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
That's right.

186
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,720
And now to finish things off, the whole reason why we're going to the gym is because we want

187
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,040
to get in shape.

188
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
All right.

189
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,580
Great phrase here to get in shape.

190
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,900
This is something a lot of people like to do in the new year.

191
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,760
So they say, okay, it's a new year.

192
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,040
I want a new body.

193
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm going to get in shape.

194
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,560
That means I will lose weight, build some muscle and start to feel good.

195
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
That's right.

196
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
So we want to get in shape.

197
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Very good.

198
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

199
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,400
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight?

200
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I can't.

201
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
I have to go to the gym.

202
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Come on.

203
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
You can go tomorrow.

204
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Just skip it today.

205
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
It's not as if you're going to get in trouble.

206
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,920
Actually, I will.

207
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go.

208
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I like it because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.

209
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
That's cool.

210
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,440
Does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah.

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,280
He makes a workout plan depending on the areas I want to work on or the muscles I want to

213
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
build.

214
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,560
Like for example, in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes

215
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,960
me work out with free weights.

216
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,680
Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

217
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,080
Seems like you're really getting into shape.

218
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,840
Going to the gym, getting a personal trainer, what do you think?

219
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
Is it a good idea or a bad idea?

220
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,800
I think for some people who have a hard time getting motivated, so people who don't like

221
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,480
to go to the gym, it's a great idea because having another person push you can really

222
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
help.

223
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,640
I think for other people who are already pushing themselves, it's not as helpful.

224
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,080
I think also if you just start out going to the gym, I think you should get a personal

225
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,040
trainer for the first couple of weeks because you really have to understand and learn what

226
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,720
you're doing and the purpose of that exercise and figure out how many sets, how many repetitions.

227
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,760
This is very important because some people just go and they overwork it.

228
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,480
They do and they don't know how to use the machines or the weights.

229
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,280
You can actually harm yourself.

230
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,440
You can pull a hamstring or something if you don't know what you're doing.

231
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,240
For people who've never learned how to exercise, maybe it's a good idea like you say.

232
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,600
It's a very interesting thing.

233
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Actually gyms as well, very popular nowadays, especially with the holidays passing.

234
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,300
People gain some holiday weight.

235
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,520
You got to go back to the gym to lose that weight.

236
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
That's right.

237
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Let us know.

238
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Do you go to the gym?

239
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,400
If so, what parts of your body do you like to focus on?

240
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,600
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

241
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
All right.

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
We'll see you guys there.

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Take care.

244
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:42,920
Bye bye.
