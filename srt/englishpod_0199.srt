00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,080
And my name is Kathryn and today we might just teach you how to save a life.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
That's right.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to save a life and we are going to do this by applying first aid.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,480
So let's take a look at vocabulary preview and find out just exactly what this phrase

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,740
means.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,740
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,800
Okay, so we have this word first aid.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
It's two parts.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
So first isâ€¦

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Before.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Before.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Early.

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Early.

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Alright.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
And aid.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
So when you aid someone, you help them, right?

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Right.

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
So this is actually a noun.

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Aid is help.

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
So we're applying first aid.

23
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,760
This means we're the first person to come and help someone.

24
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,800
So for example, if someone is bleeding, the first aid is to stop the bleeding.

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Okay.

26
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Alright.

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
So first aid.

28
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
We're going to learn all about this.

29
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,680
Take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey Joe, where have you been these past few days?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,560
I've been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red

32
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Cross.

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Cool!

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
I've always wanted to do something like that.

35
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,960
Have you learnt anything useful?

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
For sure.

37
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,320
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
even how to apply CPR.

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,040
Have you treated any real emergencies?

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,880
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,600
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple

42
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,320
of compound fractures.

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,400
His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital.

44
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,520
It was intense.

45
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
I can imagine.

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,240
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that

47
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,880
anytime soon.

48
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,800
Alright, we're back.

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,840
So there are a lot of medical and health-related terms in this dialogue, so why don't we

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,520
take a look at a couple of those in Language Takeaway.

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Language Takeaway

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,480
Well, starting us out here in Language Takeaway, we have the name of an organization that's

53
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,040
not-for-profit, that's very, very, very famous.

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
This is called the Red Cross.

55
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Okay, so the Red Cross.

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,920
And this is usually a place where you donate blood.

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,760
You can also get some blood exams done.

58
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
What else do you do there?

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,640
Well, the Red Cross is an organization that has offices and clinics all over the world.

60
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,520
And if you want to help, you can volunteer, you can donate money, and you can donate blood.

61
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,840
But the Red Cross will take this and it will help other people, people who have been in

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,200
disasters or wars.

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,680
And so maybe the Red Cross office near you will have blood banks and blood donations.

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,160
But really, they help people, they provide aid to people who are unhealthy or sick or

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
have been in a war.

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,760
A very humanitarian organization.

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
So worth it.

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Go to the Red Cross and donate blood.

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,640
In the dialogue, the two people are discussing real emergencies.

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,160
And one person says he went along with some paramedics.

71
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,040
So a paramedic is a person.

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
It's a person.

73
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
It's a profession, right?

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
To be a paramedic.

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Exactly.

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
But it's not really a doctor.

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
So what's the difference here?

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,640
So paramedics are something like nurses, right?

79
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,080
That travel in an ambulance and get to an emergency or get to the scene of an accident

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
and help out a person.

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,440
So they immobilize the person, they give them oxygen.

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,800
They make sure that they stay alive until they reach the hospital.

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,160
Okay, so a paramedic, you might hear the word medic, it's the same thing.

84
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,440
A paramedic is like a nurse.

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,280
They're not a doctor, but they're usually the first person to help when there's been

86
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,320
an accident or a disaster.

87
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,400
Right, exactly.

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,560
So if there is an earthquake and many people are stuck in the buildings, usually paramedics

89
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,640
will be the ones on the scene trying to get them out and helping them by applying for

90
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
first aid.

91
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Well, after that, we have finally some of the injuries that a paramedic might see.

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,040
The first injury is usually associated with the head.

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
This is called a concussion.

94
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,760
You suffered a concussion.

95
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,120
It sounds painful.

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Yeah, it does.

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
And actually, it's very common, I think, right?

98
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
If you fall and you hit your head.

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
That's right.

100
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,960
So a concussion is really when your brain hits your skull.

101
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,320
That's the bone that protects your brain.

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,840
So really, you're hitting your head really, really hard.

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,640
And usually, this can have some bad side effects like you lose your memory or you're a little

104
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
bit confused.

105
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,240
It's very common with football players.

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,560
With any contact sport, if people suffer concussions, and it's just like, imagine when you have

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,720
a DVD player and you hit it and the disc skips or it goes back.

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,920
That's kind of what happens to your brain.

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,160
So you can suffer memory loss.

111
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,120
You can even lose your sight temporarily.

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
That's right.

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,520
So this can be very serious and obviously should be looked at by a paramedic.

114
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,080
We also have another situation that is similarly serious.

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,760
It's called a compound fracture.

116
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Okay.

117
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,440
So what is a fracture or two fracture?

118
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,640
A fracture is a thing.

119
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
It's a break.

120
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Okay.

121
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,600
So you could say, I broke my arm.

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,200
But you could also say, I fractured my arm.

123
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,720
This is the more medical term.

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,240
But of course, there are different ways to break something.

125
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,040
And so in medicine, we have a compound fracture.

126
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,280
So a compound fracture is pretty painful and it's a little bit more serious.

127
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,560
You have a simple fracture, which is when your bone just breaks.

128
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,040
Or a hairline, which means that there's a little thin part where it's broken, but it's

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
not really serious.

130
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,640
In this case, it's your bones actually push towards each other.

131
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,060
They kind of form like a little mountain, right?

132
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,040
Or they're on top of each other.

133
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,800
Think about when two cars hit and they kind of crash up into each other.

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Exactly.

135
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
It's like that, but it's your bone.

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
So it's extremely painful.

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,280
It's very, very painful.

139
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,680
So the person suffered a concussion and a compound fracture.

140
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
Now the friend that he was talking to said, wow, it sounds amazing.

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,680
It's really cool that you're doing that.

142
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
But you know what?

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,440
I faint when I see blood.

144
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Do you do this?

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
No.

146
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
No, me neither.

147
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Well, some people when they see blood, they feel very, very uncomfortable or sick.

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,980
And so to faint is to fall down on the ground.

149
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,720
It's almost like you're falling asleep, but it's not sleep.

150
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,960
Have you ever fainted?

151
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,940
I fainted twice in my life.

152
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,840
One time I fainted because of heat.

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,380
It was very, very, very hot.

154
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,240
And I couldn't breathe for a moment.

155
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,920
And then I woke up on the ground.

156
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Wow.

157
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Yeah.

158
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Yeah.

159
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
That's what happens.

160
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Exactly.

161
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,600
So yeah, if you ever faint, it's basically that you're just standing there, you're sitting

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,640
somewhere and all of a sudden everything goes black and you wake up and you're on the ground.

163
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,200
And you feel very, very weak before that.

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,880
And very pale, I think as well.

165
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Yeah, your blood goes away from your brain and you pass out.

166
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
It's a very strange sensation.

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,680
Because then everyone else around you, they know what happened.

168
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,480
They saw you and so they're looking at you like you're crazy or maybe sick.

169
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
To faint.

170
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
All right.

171
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
So that's to faint.

172
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,520
So those are the key words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

173
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,860
Let's take a listen to our dialogue again.

174
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:13,560
And we'll be back shortly to take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,080
Hey Joe, where have you been these past few days?

176
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,280
I've been busy with the first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

177
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Cool.

178
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
I've always wanted to do something like that.

179
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,880
Have you learned anything useful?

180
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
For sure.

181
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,280
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and

182
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,320
even how to apply CPR.

183
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
Have you treated any real emergencies?

184
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,500
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple

186
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,220
of compound fractures.

187
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,280
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

188
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
It was intense.

189
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,400
I can imagine.

190
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,320
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that any

191
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,280
time soon.

192
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,120
All right.

193
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,320
So quiz, Marco.

194
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,680
What is the first thing that a paramedic does when he or she finds a body in an emergency?

195
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,200
What paramedic checks for a pulse to make sure you're alive, right?

196
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Right.

197
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
A pulse.

198
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
So, dum, dum, dum, dum.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,920
The pulse is the rhythm, that's the sound of your heart pumping blood.

200
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,320
And you can feel someone's wrist or their throat.

201
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,400
So to check for a pulse means to check and make sure their heart is pumping blood.

202
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Right.

203
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
And not only that, but to make sure that the heart is pumping blood relatively normal because

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,440
sometimes your heart can be pumping blood too fast or too slow.

205
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
And if it's too slow, it's very possible that you will faint.

206
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Very good.

207
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
All right.

208
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
So we check for a pulse.

209
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Now, what else happens?

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,360
Well, if there's a very serious emergency and the paramedic needs help to give aid to

211
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,520
the person who is injured, then they will rush that person to the hospital.

212
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Okay.

213
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,000
So the verb to rush, what does that mean?

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,080
All right, so to rush someone or to rush someone to the hospital means to take someone or to

215
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
go with someone very, very quickly.

216
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Okay.

217
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
So let's give an example.

218
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,440
I could say, listen, Marco, I don't want to rush you, but I really need the report done

219
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
today.

220
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
Or I could say, I need to rush home.

221
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
My parents need me.

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
Or if a woman is having a baby, you want to rush her to the emergency room.

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Right.

224
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Okay.

225
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
So you need to go quickly.

226
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
All right.

227
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,280
So when we're talking about fainting, the person said, before he used the word faint,

228
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,960
he said, I tend to faint.

229
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay.

230
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,480
I tend to.

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,960
I tend to is a really great verb that describes a normal or habitual behavior.

232
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,600
That's like saying, I tend to faint when it's very, very hot outside.

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,200
That means I often faint when it's very, very hot outside.

234
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,840
It's something that happens normally.

235
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
So it's a tendency.

236
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Right.

237
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
It's not for everyone.

238
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
It's for me.

239
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
So I tend to.

240
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,960
What's something that you tend to faint when you see?

241
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
I never faint.

242
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
You don't faint.

243
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,080
No, just kidding.

244
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
But you know what?

245
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,120
I tend to leave the towel on the bed sometimes after I take a shower.

246
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I know it's a bad habit.

247
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
And then the sheets smell.

248
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,400
No, they don't.

249
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,160
Because I leave it there for like five or 10 minutes and then I realize, oh my God,

250
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,520
and then I pick it up.

251
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,720
But it's hard to...

252
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
That's gross.

253
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
No, it's not.

254
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,440
I tend to forget my leftover food in the refrigerator for a long time.

255
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,280
And then it starts to smell.

256
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
That's gross.

257
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,200
But I don't like to waste food.

258
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,680
But you like let it rot and then your fridge smells.

259
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
It happens.

260
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,960
So that's all we've got for Fluency Builder today.

261
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,320
But we can talk about tendencies in a moment.

262
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,040
Maybe a homework assignment could be to think of something that you tend to do.

263
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
That's right.

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
That could be an interesting homework assignment.

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,480
But before we jump into that, why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time?

266
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:02,320
Hey, Joe, where have you been these past few days?

267
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,480
I've been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.

268
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Cool.

269
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,680
I've always wanted to do something like that.

270
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,120
Have you learned anything useful?

271
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
For sure.

272
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,480
I mean, we learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and

273
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
even how to apply CPR.

274
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
Have you treated any real emergencies?

275
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, they took us along with some paramedics.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,680
There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple

277
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,440
of compound fractures.

278
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,480
His wounds were pretty serious, so they had to rush him to the hospital.

279
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
It was intense.

280
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I can imagine.

281
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,920
I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime

282
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
soon.

283
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,120
All right, we're back.

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,360
So that's all the time we have for today.

285
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,000
Be sure to do your homework assignment.

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Come to EnglishPod.com.

287
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,920
In the comments section, tell us, what do you tend to do?

288
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
It could be a good thing.

289
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
It could be a bad thing.

290
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,000
Obviously, you can try and use some of the vocabulary you heard in today's lesson about

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
health and safety.

292
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
You might get some extra points from us for doing that.

293
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,280
I know some people who tend to leave the house with a whole medicine kit in their bags or

294
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
in their purses.

295
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Really?

296
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
A first aid kit.

297
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
A first aid kit, exactly.

298
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Wow.

299
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
So do you do this?

300
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Let us know.

301
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

302
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,960
That's all we've got for today, so until next time.

303
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Bye.

304
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:46,600
Bye.
