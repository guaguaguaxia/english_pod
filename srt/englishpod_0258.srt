00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,800
My name is Catherine and today we have a lesson for you all about life at home and life with

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
your parents.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
That's right.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,320
We've all lived with our parents when we were younger or maybe we still do and of course

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,800
they have certain rules in the house and well, when you break those rules, something happens.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,260
There are consequences and that's what's happening in today's dialogue.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,920
So let's take a listen to this dialogue and when we come back, we'll be talking more about

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:45,300
what's going on and what some of these words and phrases mean.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,680
Do you know what time it is?

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,560
Um, ten.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,240
Get in this door, young man.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,320
It's midnight.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,520
You are two hours past curfew.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,360
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,640
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn't leave the party.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
I don't care.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,160
You are grounded for life, mister.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,000
Mom, that is so unfair.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,660
You know the rules and you broke them.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,200
No allowance and no TV for a week.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,000
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,020
For being a couple of hours late?

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,760
You have to be kidding.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,880
I don't want to hear it.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,000
Now go to your room.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All right, we're back.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,040
So a very typical case, somebody or the kid returns home, it's too late and now they're

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
in trouble.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
Yes, his parents are not very happy.

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,940
In this case, it's his mom who is telling him what the consequences will be.

34
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,320
So let's take a look at Language Takeaway and find out what some of these key words

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,500
are.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,760
All right, so the first word that we're going to take a look is actually something that

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,840
his mom said and he said that you are two hours past curfew.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Curfew.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,560
So curfew has to do specifically with the time when your parents expect you at home.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
That's right.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,600
So if your curfew is ten o'clock, you have to be home before or by ten o'clock.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Right.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,120
So in this case, if the boy's curfew is ten o'clock and he arrives home at midnight, twelve

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,360
o'clock, he's two hours past curfew.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
That's right.

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,840
And even sometimes cities or governments will implement certain curfews at certain times.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
That's right.

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,320
And I don't think adults really have curfews at home.

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
No, I don't think so.

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,440
It depends on what you want, but kids definitely have curfews.

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,280
What happens though, Marco, when you break curfew?

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
So this is a very serious offense and you're going to get punished.

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,720
And the way that we say this, usually parents to their children, you are grounded or you

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,440
ground that kid.

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
Okay.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,760
So you might have heard this word when talking about airplanes or flights at an airport.

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
The plane was grounded.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,120
It basically means it can't go anywhere.

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,920
And so when you're talking about a kid or a person, you basically mean, okay, you're

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,520
grounded, you can't go out with your friends.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,180
You can't go anywhere.

63
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
Usually you can go to school.

64
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Right, right.

65
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,200
But you can't have fun is the meaning.

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
That's right.

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
So it's usually a fixed phrase.

68
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
You're grounded.

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,160
That means that you are punished.

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,440
You can't go out.

71
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,240
But in this case, the mom specified saying you're grounded.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,000
So that means that he can't go out.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,880
But on top of that, she said no allowance and no TV for a week.

74
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh man.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,880
So allowance is the money that your parents give you to go out, like to go to the movies

76
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,040
or something.

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,240
And your parents might give this to you on a weekly basis.

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,720
So every Saturday you get $5 or on a monthly basis, every month you get $20.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
And when his mother says you're not going to have any allowance for a week, that means

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,880
we're not going to give you any money this week.

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
That's right.

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,000
So that is an allowance, how much money you get per month or per week.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The key thing about allowance though, is that it's not something you do for work.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,940
You don't work and receive allowance.

85
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,160
If you work, you have a salary.

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Allowance is something that you get for free from someone.

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,920
So you can get an allowance from your boss to eat, but you can also have an allowance

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,640
from your parents to do fun things.

89
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
That's right.

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,720
So usually kids, obviously they can't work, so they get an allowance from their parents,

91
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,200
usually for fun things like going to the movies and stuff.

92
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Exactly.

93
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
All right.

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,440
Now, going back a little bit, let's take a look at two ways that the mom addressed or

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,480
called her son, because obviously it's her son.

96
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,160
But when he got home, she said, get in this door, young man.

97
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Okay.

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,000
So, angry mom phrases.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,560
When you're in trouble, your parents tend to use different words to talk to you.

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,360
So this is a very popular one, young man.

101
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,000
So it's like saying, you should be mature, but you made a mistake.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
All right.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
So, come inside right now, young man.

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,260
It's a way to emphasize that you are also very angry.

105
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,080
And also, when he was trying to explain what happened, she said, I don't care.

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,680
You're grounded for life, mister.

107
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
You're grounded for life, mister.

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,760
So these are both ways of talking to young boys.

109
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,440
Mister is the opposite of miss.

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,240
But in the case of a young girl, you'd say, get in this door, young lady.

111
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Right.

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,200
And then, you're grounded for life, missy.

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Missy.

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Yeah, I think they say missy.

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Missy.

116
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,680
So, missy, mister, young man, young lady.

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,600
These are all ways of referring to people in kind of, it's weird.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,440
It's kind of like they're adults, but they're not.

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Yeah, that's right.

120
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
That's like saying, you're in trouble.

121
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Yeah.

122
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,600
So, very interesting things going on here with this young man who got grounded.

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Why don't we go back, let's take a look at our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a

124
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:59,440
bit.

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you know what time it is?

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
10.

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
Get in this door, young man.

128
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,480
It's midnight.

129
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,680
You are two hours past curfew.

130
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,520
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

131
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,760
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.

132
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,080
I don't care.

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,400
You are grounded for life, mister.

134
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,160
Mom, that is so unfair.

135
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,800
You know the rules, and you broke them.

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,360
No allowance and no TV for a week.

137
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,160
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
What?

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,200
You're being a couple of hours late?

140
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,920
You have to be kidding.

141
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
I don't want to hear it.

142
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,600
Now, go to your room.

143
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
All right, we're back.

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,520
So, now let's take a look at four key phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

145
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Fluency Builder.

146
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
All right.

147
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,240
So, this first phrase is something that actually we hear when the young boy or the young man

148
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,640
is giving his excuse for being late.

149
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,880
He said, listen, I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10.

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
That's right.

151
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,560
So, the phrasal verb there is to drop off.

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,440
This means to leave someone somewhere.

153
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
That's right.

154
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,760
But usually it means to drive someone to a certain place.

155
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,320
So, for example, Jennifer probably has a car, and Jennifer was supposed to take this boy

156
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,640
home, so he said she was going to drop me off before 10 o'clock.

157
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,920
That means kind of leave him at his house.

158
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
That's right.

159
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,200
The verb is to drop off, but we usually insert the subject in between it.

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,360
So, to drop me off.

161
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,000
She is going to drop me off.

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
I dropped him off at the bank.

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
That's right.

164
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
All right.

165
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,240
So, now that Jennifer was supposed to drop him off at 10, that didn't happen, so he got

166
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,720
grounded and his mom was saying that she usually doesn't really ground him, but this time I

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
have to put my foot down.

168
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
She's angry.

169
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah.

170
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
He's upset and she's angry and she said, listen, I have to put my foot down.

171
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
What does this mean?

172
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
You put your foot on the ground?

173
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,360
It's strange to hear this phrase.

174
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,200
It means that she's going to be strict, that she's not going to let him just get away with

175
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
it or not ground him.

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,240
She really has to be strict and she has to punish him.

177
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay.

178
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,240
So, to put your foot down or I put my foot down, this means to be strict with someone,

179
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,520
to not maybe bend the rules or be flexible.

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,000
So, for example, my mother was always very, very loose with my brother.

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,780
He could do what he wanted or whatever, but one day he did something really horrible and

182
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,440
she finally put her foot down.

183
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
And she grounded him.

184
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,360
She grounded him for three months.

185
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Alright.

186
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
So, that's what happens when somebody puts their foot down.

187
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,960
And now, obviously, he was very surprised that he's going to be grounded for so long

188
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,640
and only for being a couple of hours late.

189
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
So, he said, you have to be kidding.

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
You have got to be kidding.

191
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,840
So, this is a rhetorical.

192
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,600
So, he's not talking about joking here.

193
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
He's saying, no way.

194
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,020
I can't believe it.

195
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,680
This is not happening to me.

196
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Yeah.

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
You're not serious.

198
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
You're not serious.

199
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
And I would be too.

200
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,280
No one likes to be grounded.

201
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,600
But he's saying, okay, come on.

202
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
No way.

203
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
That's too serious.

204
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
That's right.

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,000
So, this is a phrase that you can use with someone if you're not really believing what

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,640
they're saying or you're surprised.

207
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
You have to be kidding me.

208
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Yeah.

209
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,520
But usually, there's also a degree of anger.

210
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,840
So, you're upset at the decision.

211
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,280
For example, I'm watching the World Cup right now and there was a foul.

212
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,040
And I was very upset because I didn't think it was a foul and I said, you have got to

213
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,240
be kidding me.

214
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
That's right.

215
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Okay.

216
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,160
So, that's exactly the way that we would use that phrase.

217
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,520
And well, obviously, the mother had made up her mind.

218
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,060
She's very decided.

219
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,640
And she said, I don't want to hear it.

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,880
So, this is the end of the conversation.

221
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Okay.

222
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,520
This is one of those phrases that will just stop anything you're talking about.

223
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,720
So, they're arguing and she says, nope, I don't want to hear it.

224
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,900
That means no more excuses.

225
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,000
No more talking.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is the end.

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's right.

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't want to hear it.

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And it's used in many scenarios, right?

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,640
Not only for somebody being angry or grounded, but also in a meeting.

231
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I don't want to hear it.

232
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
That's it.

233
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
We're doing my idea.

234
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
We're going forward with it.

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Well, be careful because that's usually what the boss will say.

236
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
That's right.

237
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,040
It's not the most gentle phrase.

238
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
And so, you have to be careful with how you use it.

239
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,880
But if you have authority like you're a parent or you're a boss, you can say, nope, I don't

240
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
want to hear it.

241
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
I have made my decision.

242
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
That's right.

243
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Okay.

244
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,040
So, we've taken a look at a lot of great things.

245
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,440
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue one last time.

246
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:33,840
We'll be back in a bit.

247
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,440
Do you know what time it is?

248
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
10.

249
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,760
Get in this door, young man.

250
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,840
It's midnight.

251
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,040
You are two hours past curfew.

252
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

253
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,160
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.

254
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
I don't care.

255
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,760
You are grounded for life, mister.

256
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,560
Mom, that is so unfair.

257
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,240
You know the rules and you broke them.

258
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,760
No allowance and no TV for a week.

259
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,560
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

260
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
What?

261
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,600
For being a couple of hours late?

262
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,320
You have to be kidding.

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,560
I don't want to hear it.

264
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Now go to your room.

265
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,280
All right.

266
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
We're back.

267
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
We've all been grounded.

268
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,000
What is the longest you've been grounded for?

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Do you remember?

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,920
I was a good girl, so maybe a week.

271
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Really?

272
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Yeah, maybe not even.

273
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,560
I never really got in trouble as a kid.

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
What about you?

275
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,120
I think once I was grounded the entire summer.

276
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Oh, rough.

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Yeah, the entire summer vacation.

278
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,080
I don't remember exactly what I did, but my dad was pretty upset with me and yeah,

279
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,800
he was really strict, so I got grounded quite a bit.

280
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,080
I tend to think that girls get in trouble less.

281
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I think so.

282
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,200
I don't know if it's because they're good.

283
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600
I think probably it's because they're better at hiding things from their parents.

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Maybe.

285
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,320
Because whenever I would come home, my mother would always wake up, but she doesn't really

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,280
understand what time it is, and so I'd say, oh, mom, it's 11 o'clock.

287
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Good night.

288
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,400
And it'd be like 4 o'clock in the morning, and she had no idea.

289
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,720
So who was the person or the parent that put their foot down?

290
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,840
Was it your mom or your dad?

291
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,520
My dad was the serious one.

292
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Oh, really?

293
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,640
Yeah, it's interesting because sometimes it's the dad that's very strict, and the mom kind

294
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,600
of helps you out and tries to kind of not get you grounded or something, but sometimes

295
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
it's the other way around.

296
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,200
The mom is really strict and firm, and the dad's like, come on, don't ground him.

297
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
They're just having fun.

298
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, I think in some families, the children understand who is strict and who is maybe

299
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,080
not so strict, and so they say, oh, well, mom said that it's okay, so I think maybe

300
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,760
you should let me go out, and the dad will be very angry because the mother said that

301
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
it's okay.

302
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
That's right.

303
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
All right, so that's all the time we have for today.

304
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,360
We're really curious to get your stories, maybe tell us why were you grounded or how

305
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,760
long were you grounded for?

306
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
Or what was your curfew when you were a child or growing up?

307
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,200
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

308
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
We hope to see you there.

309
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
All right.

310
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
We'll see you guys there.

311
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Bye.

312
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:12,680
Well, see you guys there.
