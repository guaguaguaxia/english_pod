00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,780
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,880
That's right.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,160
Today we're going to take a look at our mobile phones but not the physical phone.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
Now we're going to talk about services that you can get for your mobile phone.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,040
Alright so in America and many other places you don't buy that little card with money

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,040
on it.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,440
You actually have to pay every month for a service.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,000
So we're going to learn about this today.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,880
Let's check out our dialogue.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,600
Telco Mobile how can I help you?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
Yes, I'd like to activate my voicemail service please.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
Certainly sir.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,480
We currently have a special promotion where we include voicemail services, call waiting

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
and also three-way calling.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
Sure, that sounds great.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,240
Are there any other fees?

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Not at all.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,720
No hidden fees or surcharges.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,520
It is a flat monthly rate.

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Perfect.

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,480
I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,840
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,160
Yes, of course.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,040
We can activate all these services in about an hour.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,160
Alright, we're back.

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,880
So now let's take a look at some of these services on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,400
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,560
So Marco the first word that I want to talk about today is this verb to activate.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
That's right.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,280
We have a verb here to activate and this means to make something start to work, to make something

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
begin.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
That's right.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,080
So to turn on but you don't say hey can you activate the light?

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
You wouldn't say that.

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,640
You say can you turn on the light.

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,440
But to activate means to start a service.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
That's right.

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,640
So this is what we want today.

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:57,200
We want to activate some services and the first one that we ask for is voicemail service.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Voicemail service.

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
Now let's think about the words that make up this one word.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,840
Voicemail.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,680
So it's like a mailbox for your phone.

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
That's right.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,700
Where you leave messages, obviously not text messages but you leave voice messages.

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
That's right.

49
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,520
So I'm sorry I cannot answer the phone right now.

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Please leave a message after the beep.

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
That's my voicemail message.

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
That's right.

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
So it's actually a very useful thing.

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
We'll talk about that a little bit later.

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,600
But let's take a look at our next service.

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
We also want to get call waiting.

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
All right.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,160
So this is a very interesting service.

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,520
I don't know if they have this in other parts of the world but in America if I'm talking

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,900
on the phone to you Marco and we're having a nice conversation but then my mom calls,

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,080
when I'm talking I hear beep, beep, beep.

62
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,120
I hear some sounds and that means someone else is trying to call you.

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
That's right.

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,520
So you can't hear this but I can hear this and that means if I want to talk to my mom

65
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,480
I'll say, hey Marco listen, someone else is calling, can I call you tomorrow?

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
That's right.

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,820
So actually call waiting is a very useful service because the person that's calling

68
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,920
you will never get a busy signal.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,220
You'll always see them available.

70
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,580
But the good thing is that you can switch between calls.

71
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,240
So I could say, hey Marco listen, I think that's my mom, can you hold, can you wait,

72
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,040
I will be right back and then I push a button and then I can talk to my mom and then my

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,760
mom says, okay I'll talk to you later, I push a button and then Marco you're there.

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
That's right.

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
That's right.

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Very useful service as well.

77
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,180
Now let's take a look at our next service that we are also getting as part of this package.

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,200
We are getting three-way calling.

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,320
So from the name of this we can think of three people talking.

80
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,040
So maybe Marco you want to talk to my mom too.

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,400
So we can talk and then we add another person so you can call a third phone number, one,

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,880
two, three, me, you and someone else and the three of us can talk at the same time.

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
That's right.

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,080
So it's kind of a way of having a small conference between three people.

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
That's right.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,240
And so this is what you can do with three-way calling.

87
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,640
You can call two people simultaneously and talk to them at the same time.

88
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
So a lot of great services here.

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,800
I think we've learned a couple of different things.

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Why don't we review it and listen to the dialogue again.

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,360
Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

92
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,880
Yes, I'd like to activate my voicemail service please.

93
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,120
Certainly, sir.

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
We currently have a special promotion where we include voicemail services, call waiting

95
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,000
and also three-way calling.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Sure, that sounds great.

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
Are there any other fees?

98
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Not at all.

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,560
No hidden fees or surcharges.

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
It is a flat monthly rate.

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Perfect.

102
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,360
I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.

103
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,680
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes, of course.

105
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,560
We can activate all these services in about an hour.

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,240
All right, we're back.

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,400
So now let's keep on going here towards the last half of our dialogue.

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,520
Let's take a look at some more words on Language Takeaway Part 2.

109
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,020
Language Takeaway.

110
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,200
So this first phrase in Language Takeaway Part 2 is hidden fees.

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Hidden fees.

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
What are these?

113
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,320
The operator guarantees that there are no hidden fees.

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,240
So this is usually what we call the fine print, the small fees that we don't really know about.

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,320
So they say, oh, it costs $3 a month, but you have small little hidden fees.

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Like if you're late on a payment, they'll charge you an extra dollar or if you use the

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,600
service too much, they'll charge you another extra dollar.

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Right.

119
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,360
So a fee is something that you pay, all right, and something that is hidden means you cannot

120
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,440
see it.

121
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,240
And so like you're saying with this example, there are many, many conditions, many, many

122
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,160
different things, rules that we have to follow.

123
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
And if we don't follow those rules exactly, then maybe this company that provides the

124
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
phone service will ask us for more and more money.

125
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
That's right.

126
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,200
And actually it has to do a lot with our next word where she said that there are also no

127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
surcharges.

128
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,400
Okay, so a surcharge is an extra amount of money that you have to pay.

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,600
So we say that this service has no hidden fees or surcharges.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,920
So that means that we don't have to pay anything additional to what we are already paying.

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,680
For example, some companies will say, okay, pay us $10 and you get your new cell phone

132
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
phone plan.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,280
But to activate your service is another $5.

134
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,520
So the total price is $15 and that's, that's a surcharge.

135
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,640
It's an extra fee that you have to pay.

136
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
That's right.

137
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Okay.

138
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,440
And continuing on the topic of money, she says it is a flat monthly rate, a flat monthly

139
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
rate.

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,200
Well, monthly is an adverb that tells us how often we pay.

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,120
We pay one time every month.

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,600
But this term flat rate is very, very important and it happened.

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,120
We use this term a lot when we're talking about paying fees.

144
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,480
So a flat rate means it does not change when you, for example, talk more on the phone.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
That's right.

146
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,840
So you pay the same amount every month.

147
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
That's right.

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,260
A clear example is probably your internet service provider.

149
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,720
You pay $20 a month and that's a flat rate.

150
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,120
If you use the internet 24 hours a day, nothing happens.

151
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
You don't pay more.

152
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,600
If you use it less, you still pay the same amount of money.

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,000
So what if I pay $10 normally, but this month I use the internet a lot and now I have to

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,160
pay $15.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Is that a flat rate?

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
No, no, that's not a flat rate.

157
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Okay.

158
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,640
That's a change that that changes with my use.

159
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
That's right.

160
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Okay.

161
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,040
So now let's take a look at one last service that this man was also interested in getting

162
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,560
and he says that he wants to get a call forwarding service.

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,400
He wants to forward his calls to a local number.

164
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Okay.

165
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,240
So to forward something means to pass it along.

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,960
So call forwarding means that if I'm not available, for example, I'm not at home and someone calls

167
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,400
my home, there's no one there to talk to the person that's calling, then maybe I could

168
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,600
have a call forwarding service that will make the call go to my cellular phone.

169
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
All right.

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,960
So the call forwarding means that the call will travel to another phone.

171
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
That's right.

172
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
That's right.

173
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,560
So as you said, this is what call forwarding is and the word to forward, as you said, to

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,000
pass along, maybe many of you have done it in your emails.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,520
When you get maybe a nice message, you forward it to more of your friends and this is the

176
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
exact same definition.

177
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Exactly.

178
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,680
So you have one message and you pass it on to someone else.

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,320
And so in call forwarding, you normally have this service if you're often on business trips

180
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,080
or traveling, you're out of town.

181
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
That's right.

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,440
It's very, very helpful for people who are not in one place all the time.

183
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
That's right.

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,800
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

185
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,440
Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

186
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,160
Yes, I'd like to activate my voicemail service, please.

187
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Certainly, sir.

188
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,400
We currently have a special promotion where we include voicemail services, call waiting

189
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,040
and also three-way calling.

190
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Sure.

191
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
That sounds great.

192
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
Are there any other fees?

193
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Not at all.

194
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,620
No hidden fees or surcharges.

195
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,320
It is a flat monthly rate.

196
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Perfect.

197
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,880
I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.

198
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,720
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,100
Yes, of course.

200
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,200
We can activate all these services in about an hour.

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,040
So talking about all these services, it's very interesting because many of these services

202
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,400
are not really available everywhere in the world.

203
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
Like for example, voicemail.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
So in China, no one really has voicemail.

206
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,280
It's very strange for an American because you think, well, if I'm not home, I want to

207
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
know why this person called.

208
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,600
But oftentimes, you just have to call back and find out.

209
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
That's right.

210
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,000
And actually, I really think that voicemail service is a very good thing, especially if

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
you need to leave a message for someone.

212
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
You know, hey, we're at the restaurant.

213
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Call me back when you have a chance.

214
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,240
But also, call waiting.

215
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,560
I really, really hate to call someone and have the busy tone.

216
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,800
And then you know that they're on the telephone, but you don't know when they will stop talking

217
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,000
on the phone.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,640
This really annoys me too, especially when I call for delivery food from a restaurant.

219
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,160
It's like, please answer your phone.

220
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,880
But maybe someone's ordering a lot of food.

221
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
That's right.

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,080
So actually, these services are very common in the United States.

223
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,000
And I'm sure there are even more services now.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,160
I know that you can have a telephone number, for example, in another country, but it'll

225
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,360
ring in the United States.

226
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,040
Or you can connect your computer and your messaging service and all these things to

228
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
your phone.

229
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,080
So it's pretty technologically advanced.

230
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,760
But I'm very curious to know about you guys, our listeners, what kind of services for your

231
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,480
cell phone or for your landline do you have?

232
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,120
Do you have call forwarding or voicemail?

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Let us know.

234
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

235
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
All right.

236
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
We'll see everyone there.

237
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Bye-bye.
