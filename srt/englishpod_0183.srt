00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,700
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,480
My name is Catherine and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
That's right.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,680
We are going to talk about winter but specifically about the clothes you wear during winter when

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
it's very, very cold outside.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,520
That's right and I hear you're not too familiar with some of these practices because where

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,320
you come from you don't really have winter.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
We don't have winter.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,640
We have dry season and rainy season but same temperature.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,240
Well Chicago definitely has a snowy season so I'm very familiar with these things.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,040
So let's jump right into today's dialogue.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,440
We'll be hearing it one time and in a minute we'll be back to talk about it.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,360
Bye mom.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,720
Wait, Jimmy.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,200
It's cold outside.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Put a hat on.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Okay, bye.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
No, wait.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,520
You'll be too cold without mittens.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
All right, see ya.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Hold on.

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,200
With that wind you're going to catch a cold.

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Wear this scarf.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Okay, see you after school.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
Oh, and earmuffs.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Put these on.

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Here we go.

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Mom?

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Yes, honey?

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,440
I can't breathe.

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,400
So there were a couple of different items of clothing that we saw in this dialogue.

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,440
So let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, well, first of all we have mom and Jimmy.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,320
Jimmy is a boy's name.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,960
He's a little boy.

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,560
And mom is saying goodbye to him, but first she wants him to put on clothes.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
So the first item, the first thing she asks him to put on is a hat.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
A hat.

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,320
Now you probably have seen like a baseball cap or many different types of hats.

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,960
And sometimes in other languages they have specific names for a hat for winter, right?

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,840
But in English it's a hat.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
Anything that covers your head is a hat.

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,320
That's kind of like the category.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,920
So maybe this one is a warm wool hat, but in the end it's a hat.

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
It's a hat.

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Okay.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
So he's put on the hat.

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Now what else is he going to put on?

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,280
Well, we need to keep our fingers warm.

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,320
So there are two kinds of ways to keep your fingers warm.

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,120
And the way in this dialogue that the boy keeps his fingers warm is with mittens.

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,200
All right, so mittens you put on your hands.

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,840
Now what's the difference between mittens and gloves?

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,360
Okay, gloves have special places for each finger.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,880
One, two, three, four, five on each hand.

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,800
And mittens, there's two spaces, one for your thumb and one for all your other fingers.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,920
So that means you can't really hold things.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,000
So you kind of look like a penguin or something like that.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,320
Yeah, you look like a, yeah, exactly like a penguin.

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
And it's mostly for children.

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,840
Adults don't wear mittens because adults need to hold things like keys and phones and car

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
steering wheels.

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,640
So in this case, mittens is usually for children.

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,880
Okay, so mittens.

68
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,080
And well, the mother is still a little bit worried.

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,880
So she tells him to wear a scarf.

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,900
Okay, a scarf is a long, usually made of wool, a long piece of fabric that you put around

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,840
your neck to keep your neck warm.

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay, so a scarf.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
A scarf.

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Okay, and he's put on the mittens, the scarf, the hat, and he's missing some earmuffs.

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,840
Okay, this is a little funny because usually if you're wearing a hat, you don't need earmuffs.

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
But earmuffs are like headphones, but they keep your ears warm.

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
And we wear these, they don't cover your head, they just cover your ears.

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,240
And usually they're just two round circles over your ears.

79
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,240
So as you say, exactly, they look like big earphones and they keep your ears warm.

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Now, as you say, you usually don't wear this if you're wearing a hat because, well, you

81
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,280
would put your ears inside your hat, right?

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,800
So it looks pretty silly if he's wearing all of this together.

83
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,120
All right.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,960
And so those four key items, those four key pieces of clothing are for our language takeaway

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
today.

86
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,600
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll come back soon to talk about Fluency

87
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Builder.

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Bye, mom.

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Wait, Jimmy, it's cold outside.

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Put a hat on.

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Okay, bye.

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
No, wait, you'll be too cold without mittens.

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:33,480
All right, see ya.

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,800
Hold on, with that wind you're gonna catch a cold.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Wear this scarf.

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
Okay, see you after school.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,120
Oh, and earmuffs, put these on.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Here we go.

99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Mom?

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Yes, honey?

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I can't breathe.

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
All right, we're back.

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:56,640
So now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Fluency Builder.

105
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,240
Okay, this first phrase, as I said before, has to do with the mom and the boy saying

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,840
goodbye to each other.

107
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,840
So he says, all right, see ya.

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
See ya.

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Ya.

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,440
Okay, so see as in to look, to, right?

111
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,840
You see something.

112
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
And what about Y-A-Y?

113
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Ya.

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,560
Okay, so this is a very spoken language way of saying you.

115
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,840
So we could say, see you later, but if you want to make it shorter, you can say, see

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
ya.

117
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
See ya.

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Bye.

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Bye, goodbye.

120
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
All right, so see ya.

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
And then what's our next way of saying goodbye?

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Hold on.

123
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Oh, wait, that's...

124
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
We're not there yet.

125
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,960
No, hold on is our next phrase and this is a way to say wait.

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480
Wait, hold on.

127
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
So you just say hold on, it means wait.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,160
It's not really rude, right?

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,520
It's just a little bit more casual.

130
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Exactly.

131
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
It's very casual.

132
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
So you cannot say hold.

133
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,960
That doesn't make sense.

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,900
You have to use these two words together.

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Hold on.

136
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,200
So like I said before with Marco who wants to go fast, I could say, hold on.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Wait a second.

138
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
All right.

139
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay, so hold on.

140
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
See ya.

141
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,040
And now you got to be careful because you're going to catch a cold.

142
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,000
To catch a cold.

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,360
Okay, so a cold is when you cough, you have a sore throat, it's starting to get cold outside

144
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,960
and you don't feel well.

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,320
So you have a runny nose.

146
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,080
It's an illness.

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,920
And most people get this every year.

148
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,480
It's very common.

149
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,040
But you don't get a cold, you catch a cold.

150
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,680
So catch is the same word we use for when we talk about sports like throwing and catching.

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,760
It's almost like it just hits you.

152
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
It's so fast.

153
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,920
You just catch a cold.

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,040
So that's really important what you just said because you don't use the verb get.

155
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
You don't get a cold.

156
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,000
You catch a cold.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,520
Or if you say that you were sick last week because you had a cold, you would say, oh,

158
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,960
I caught a cold or I had a cold.

159
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Exactly.

160
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,400
So remember present tense, I catch a cold.

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,920
Past tense, I caught a cold last week.

162
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Okay.

163
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,240
And our last phrase for fluency builder is here we go.

164
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Here we go.

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Okay, so when do we hear this phrase?

166
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,920
So the mother says to the boy, put these on, here we go.

167
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
So she's doing something with him.

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,600
She's helping him put his earmuffs on.

169
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
And here we go is a way to say, okay, I've finished.

170
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
Okay, I'm done.

171
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, your earmuffs are on you.

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So you're ready.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Here you go.

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Here you go.

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So we say here we go.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Like everything is ready.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Your earmuffs are on.

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Exactly.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
So maybe I'm on my computer and I have a problem and I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting,

181
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
waiting.

182
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,720
And you know when the bar's loading.

183
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,840
And finally, ding, it's ready.

184
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Here we go.

185
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Here we go.

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
It's ready.

187
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Now I can start.

188
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
It's ready.

189
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,560
Or sometimes a waitress will come and serve you food and say, here we go.

190
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Here's your order.

191
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Exactly.

192
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
So this is a way to say what you've been waiting for.

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
It's ready now.

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Okay.

195
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Great.

196
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,000
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one last time before we come

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
back.

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Here we go.

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Bye mom.

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Wait, Jimmy.

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's cold outside.

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Put a hat on.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, bye.

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, wait, you'll be too cold without mittens.

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
See ya.

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hold on.

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
With that wind, you're going to catch a cold.

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wear this scarf.

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay.

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
See you after school.

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, and earmuffs.

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Put these on.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Here we go.

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, honey.

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm ready.

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm ready.

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm ready.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm ready.

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm ready.

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm ready.

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm ready.

223
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm ready.

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm ready.

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Here we go.

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, honey.

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't breathe.

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
All right, we're back.

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So as you mentioned, in Chicago it's very, very cold.

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I imagine you had all of these winter clothes, right?

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And it's funny because I remember being a small child and my mother doing this to me,

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
putting on snow pants and boots and earmuffs and hats and gloves and scarves.

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And all of a sudden, it's winter and I'm standing on my own.

235
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And my mother's like, oh, you're getting a cold?

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I'm like, no, I'm not.

237
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not cold.

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not cold.

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm not cold.

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So I imagine you had all of these winter clothes, right?

241
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
because I remember being a small child

243
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
and my mother doing this to me,

244
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,200
putting on snow pants and boots and earmuffs

245
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,560
and hats and gloves and scarves,

246
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,000
and all of a sudden, it's so hot inside

247
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,160
because you're wearing everything

248
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,720
and so you can't even walk like you were saying,

249
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,600
you look like a penguin walking out the door.

250
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,400
And then you get to school and you're sweating, right?

251
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,960
And so in school, we had to take,

252
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,440
we had a special room and we had to take everything off

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
because there's snow everywhere

254
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
and snow can be very dangerous because it melts

255
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,440
and it turns into water.

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay, so I have very strong memories of all of this,

257
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
putting them on, taking them off

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,400
and just being warm all the time.

259
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,960
Well, yeah, when it's cold

260
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,520
or you live in a place with cold weather,

261
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,200
you have to have these items of clothing

262
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
because otherwise you might catch a cold.

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,360
Exactly, so I hope that no one out there catches a cold,

264
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,760
but if you want some suggestions,

265
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,280
wear a scarf, cover your neck, that's the most important,

266
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
your head and your scarf are the most important.

267
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,400
All right, and if you guys have any other questions
