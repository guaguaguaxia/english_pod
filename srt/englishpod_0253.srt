00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,040
My name is Catherine, and today we've got one more episode in our series about interview

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,040
skills.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,440
This is an elementary level series, and we're here today to talk about things that you might

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,800
not be very good at.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
That's right.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,680
Today we're going to talk about weaknesses, and that is our word for vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,280
So let's take a look at it now.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,560
Okay, so what is a weakness?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,000
A weakness is a thing or an activity or something that you're just not very good at or something

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
that you think you can improve.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,560
Okay, so obviously no one is perfect, and like we saw in the previous lesson, we had

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,880
a lot of good things about ourselves, key strengths, and now we're going to talk about

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
our weaknesses.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,840
Maybe you're a little bit lazy.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
That might be a weakness.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
That's right.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,080
A weakness is the opposite of strength, and that is the topic today, so let's take a listen

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,080
to today's dialogue.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Okay, Rebecca.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,800
Well I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
a little bit about your weaknesses.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Okay.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Well it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,560
Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,480
Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,600
or career.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,280
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,120
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,640
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
Well in a way, yes, but I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,960
always give 110%.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,400
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,000
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,480
Well you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself,

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
it's true.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,440
Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Yes, please.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,600
Alright, we're back.

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,280
So obviously, Rebecca did a very good job at talking about her weaknesses in a very

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
positive way.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,320
So before we get into analyzing that, why don't we take a look at a couple of words

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,400
she used on Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,440
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
One of the first words that Mr. Parsons used was a clear impression, so impression.

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Alright so I think this is a very common word when people talk about first impressions or

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
I get the impression.

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
So what is an impression?

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,480
Well an impression is like an idea or a feeling.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,160
So I can have an impression about something, it means that I don't necessarily understand

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,640
it really well or I don't have experience with it, but it's an idea that I have about

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
something.

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,760
That's right, so for example, maybe you meet somebody new and you say I get the impression

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,880
that he is a liar.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,080
But maybe then you get to know him and he's not.

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,480
So this is your idea about something or the way you feel about something.

59
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,520
So in this case, Mr. Parsons has a clear impression of her positive qualities.

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,840
That means that he has an idea or an understanding of the things that Rebecca is good at, but

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,200
he wants to know more about her weaknesses.

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,280
That's right and Mr. Parsons asked her to try and pinpoint one of her weaknesses.

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
So this word to pinpoint.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,320
This is a great word, I'm not really sure where it comes from in English, but I think

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,760
it's very visual, you can see what the word means.

66
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Pinpoint means to locate or identify or really be specific about something.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,960
That's right, so maybe if you go to the doctor and you say that your back hurts, the doctor

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,880
might ask you to try and pinpoint where on your back you have the pain.

69
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,880
That's right, so it's a way to be specific or very exact about something.

70
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Okay, so if she had to pinpoint something, she said, well, I do get a little bit frustrated.

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Okay, so frustrated is a way you feel.

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,720
I feel frustrated, he is frustrated.

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,720
It's basically a feeling that you get when you have to do something, but you don't think

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,280
you can do it or maybe something annoys you and you get frustrated.

75
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,080
For example, when people tap like this and I'm working, I get frustrated because it's

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
a distraction.

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,960
Okay, so everyone has different things that frustrate them.

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,220
Now if we take a look at this word, it is actually an adjective and we usually use it,

79
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,520
you get frustrated or as you said, you feel frustrated.

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,560
So remember, it may look like a verb, but it's actually an adjective that ends in ed,

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
frustrated, to get frustrated.

82
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,720
He got frustrated or we feel very frustrated.

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,080
Okay, and well, apart from being frustrated, she also said that she is a restless character.

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,800
Okay, so someone is restless if they don't like to stay in one place all the time.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
That means someone who wants to move around or to go places or to travel or to see new

86
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,480
things is restless.

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
That's right.

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,880
So she has a restless character, that means she likes to move around.

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
She doesn't like to stand still in one place.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Maybe she gets bored very easily.

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
Okay, so that's somebody that would be restless.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,880
But moving on, she also said that she doesn't like to shirk her responsibilities.

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
Okay, you often hear these words go together.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
So responsibilities are things that we need to do, right?

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,520
Things that other people expect us to do, to shirk a responsibility means to not do

96
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,200
something that you're supposed to do.

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,640
It means to avoid responsibility or to push it away.

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,440
Okay, so it's a verb, to shirk your responsibilities.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,520
You shouldn't shirk your responsibilities.

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
That's right.

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
Alright, so a lot of interesting key words there.

102
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

103
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay Rebecca, well I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities,

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

105
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay, well it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,360
Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,800
Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
work or career.

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

110
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,640
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

112
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Well, in a way, yes.

113
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,120
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,680
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

116
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself,

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
it's true.

118
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

119
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,520
Yes please.

120
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,360
So we've picked out three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

121
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,520
Let's take a look at those now.

122
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,120
Starting with Mr. Parson saying, so would you say if things don't go your way at work,

123
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,040
it could easily get you down?

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,540
Two great phrases there.

125
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,540
That's right.

126
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,120
So the first phrase, if things don't go your way.

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,520
So this is kind of a funny phrase when you think about it because they go your way like

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,400
to me or what is my way.

129
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,560
This basically means if things do not happen in a way that makes you happy or in a way

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
that you expect.

131
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay, so we could say he lost his job, he couldn't pay his bills, things just didn't

132
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
go his way.

133
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
That's right.

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,220
So things are not happening as he planned or as he expected.

135
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,480
You can also say the opposite.

136
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,840
So he won the lottery and he also met a really beautiful girl who wanted to be his girlfriend.

137
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
Things were going his way.

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Okay, very good.

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,200
So if things are going your way, it's good.

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,720
If things aren't going your way, then it's bad.

141
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
That's right.

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Okay, and so if things aren't going Rebecca's way, does that mean that it could easily get

143
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
her down?

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,840
Okay, so to get you down or to get someone down means to make you sad, upset or frustrated

145
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
like that where we just heard.

146
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,240
So you could ask someone like, Marco, what gets you down?

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Rainy days.

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
That's a good one.

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Yeah, rainy days get me down too.

150
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,960
So it's kind of a way of saying what makes you sad or depressed or what makes you unhappy.

151
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,880
Or in this case, if something doesn't happen as you planned it, if it doesn't go your way,

152
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
does that make you sad?

153
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Does that get you down?

154
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,280
Okay, very good.

155
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,440
So a very good question there.

156
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,760
And she responded that kind of, yeah, that does happen, but she always tries to give

157
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
110%.

158
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,280
Okay, so this is a really funny phrase because you think I can give everything I have.

159
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,840
I can work really hard and that's 100%.

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,880
But we say 110% means you do more than you can.

161
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
It's like pushing yourself more than is possible.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's right.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,540
So this is a very common phrase in sports and business.

164
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,400
People are saying, for example, I always remember my coach saying, I want you guys to give me

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,320
110% out there.

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,720
That means I really want you to try very hard to do as much as possible.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,480
Even more than your best, more than you think you can do.

168
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Exactly.

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,200
So again, it refers to the effort that you put into something.

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,520
It can be in business, sports, anything.

171
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,800
And she's basically saying, I always do more than my best.

172
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,280
I do as much as humanly possible.

173
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
That's right.

174
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,480
Okay, so a lot of great stuff there from Rebecca.

175
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,680
Why don't we listen to her one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

176
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,560
Okay, Rebecca.

177
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,840
Well I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities.

178
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,200
But let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

179
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Okay.

180
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,240
Well it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

181
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Definitely.

182
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,000
But if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,920
Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work

184
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
or career.

185
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,720
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

186
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,560
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

187
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,080
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

188
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,840
Well in a way, yes.

189
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,400
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

190
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,840
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

191
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,440
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

192
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,880
Well you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself,

193
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
it's true.

194
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,840
Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Yes, please.

196
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:05,280
Alright, so talking about weaknesses, I think one of the common mistakes when people talk

197
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,120
about weaknesses is they say they work too much.

198
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,720
And everyone says you should never say that in an interview.

199
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,880
Yeah, I think it's a bad way to talk about yourself because a boss or an employer really

200
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,120
wants to hear a real weakness.

201
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,080
And I work too hard is a way of saying, I have no weaknesses.

202
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm actually really, really perfect.

203
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,920
I just think it's a lazy answer.

204
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,440
So maybe you should avoid saying I work too hard and really focus on things that you do

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,920
have to work on.

206
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,200
And then I think the key is to say that I know this is something that I have a hard

207
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
time with, I know this is a weakness and I'm trying to improve it.

208
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,920
Yeah, I remember in some of the interviews I've had, I think my common answer was sometimes

209
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,440
I'm very late, I'm not very punctual.

210
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,040
But you know, it's a real weakness and it may seem like difficult, but then you give

211
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,400
it a little spin by saying, yeah, I'm sometimes not very punctual, but then I try to make

212
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,720
up for it, maybe staying more time at the office, or sometimes I try to wake up a little

213
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
bit earlier and make it on time.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know, something like that.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Right.

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,440
So the key there is just to show that you know it's a problem and that you're trying

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
to work on it.

218
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Yeah.

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,040
So this is actually the hardest part for me of an interview, talking about yourself in

220
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,120
a negative way, because obviously you want to get the job.

221
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,040
So you want to make sure that the employer has a good idea of yourself, but it's hard.

222
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,760
I think it's the hardest part for everyone.

223
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I don't think it's just you.

224
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Yeah, it's hard.

225
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,320
So this is an interesting topic.

226
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,800
Why don't you practice and come to our website EnglishPod.com and on our comment section,

227
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,480
why don't you tell us what your weaknesses are?

228
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
That's right.

229
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
We hope to hear from you.

230
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Of course, you can also share with us your strengths on our lesson about strengths.

231
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,240
But in this one, I recommend everyone practice this because it will come up at some point

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,880
and it's good to get the practice in.

233
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,040
So EnglishPod.com, we hope to see you there.

234
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
All right, guys.

235
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Bye.

236
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,100
Bye山本太一.
