00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,680
My name is Catherine and today we're going to buy some food at a store for basically

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,120
bread, right Marco?

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
That's right.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
Today we're going to a bakery.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:21,020
So, this is basically a shop where they sell bread and different types of bread actually.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,020
That's right.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,640
So, we're going to learn all about these different kinds of bread.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
What can I get you?

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,960
Hi, let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
Sure.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
No, that's okay.

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,120
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,440
Oh, we're out at the moment.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,120
May I suggest some rye bread?

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,480
Sure, that sounds good.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,760
Do you have any cakes?

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,400
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,040
I'll just take a cheesecake.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Will that be all?

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Yes.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
Your total is $43.20.

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:11,960
So, now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,520
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
In Language Takeaway today we have many different kinds of bread.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
The first kind actually comes to English from the French language.

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,880
We have croissants.

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
That's right, croissants.

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,200
Now, as you say, this is a type of bread that comes from France, I guess.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
That's right.

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
It's really delicious.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,920
It's buttery and flaky and it's in the shape of a crescent.

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,920
So, it's like a curve, like a C. It kind of looks like also horns because it's got two

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,400
little... It's got a horn on each side.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
It does.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
It does.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Many people like to eat this for breakfast in France, but you can find it everywhere

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,160
in America at cafes and bakeries.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,480
Okay, very good.

45
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,080
So, those are croissants.

46
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Now we're also buying blueberry muffins.

47
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Okay, muffins are a delicious baked good.

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,920
Blueberry muffins are the flavor, so we can also have strawberry or orange.

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,800
But in this case a muffin is kind of like a sweet baked good.

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
It's round.

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,760
So, it's kind of like a cake, like a little cake.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,080
It is like a little cake.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
The top is bigger than the bottom.

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,360
So, the bottom you have some paper to hold on to and the top is round and maybe a little

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
bit hard.

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Okay, very good.

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,920
So, those are muffins.

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,520
We'll post pictures of these on the site so you can see what they look like.

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,280
But moving on now, we have a type of bread.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
This is a sourdough bread.

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
All right.

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,800
So, there are many, many, many different kinds of breads, but sourdough is very unique because

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,960
the flavor is a little bit sour.

64
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
It's strong.

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:56,440
So, dough is the substance or what you use to make bread, right, or before bread is baked.

66
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
That's right.

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
So, before you make bread, it's kind of like a liquid.

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,400
You have some milk or water that you mix with flour, so you have to hold it in a bowl or

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
a cup.

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,440
And after you bake it, it becomes hard.

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,520
So, dough is when it's soft and like a liquid.

72
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Right.

73
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,760
You've seen it when they're making bread.

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,440
They have this, it looks like a paste sometimes and then it becomes hard or when they're making

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,400
pizzas that's called dough.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,600
And sour, obviously, because it has that flavor that you said, a very strong sour flavor.

77
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
That's right.

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,760
And a different kind of bread that we might find is whole wheat bread.

79
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Okay.

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,840
Now, this is like the healthy choice.

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Yes, it's normally the healthy choice.

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,960
That's because the flour that we put in the dough is whole wheat flour.

83
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
It's a little bit healthier.

84
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,080
It's actually a little bit darker than white flour, so it'll be brown.

85
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,200
So, yeah, it's basically the brown bread.

86
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,920
I think if you've noticed when you go to the store and you can get bread, you'll find one

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,880
that looks white on the inside and this one actually looks brown on the inside.

88
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
That's right.

89
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,160
And an even more brown colored bread, maybe even black, is rye bread.

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,240
So, what is rye?

91
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,480
Rye is another kind of grain and when you bake this rye bread, it has a very strong

92
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,920
flavor and it's very, very dark, almost black.

93
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,880
It's actually my favorite kind of bread.

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,920
So, what does it taste like or what's the difference between whole wheat bread and rye

95
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
bread?

96
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Rye bread is much heavier.

97
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,000
It has a stronger flavor.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,680
Whole wheat bread is lighter.

99
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay.

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Very good.

101
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,400
So, obviously, it may be a little bit difficult to understand the differences between the

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,320
breads, but we'll post pictures on the site so you can see them.

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
And also, well, you have to go out to the bakery and try them so you can taste the difference.

104
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
That's right.

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
All right.

106
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
So, now let's move on to language takeaway part two and talk about a little bit more

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,760
of the other vocab found in this lesson.

108
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,280
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

109
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
What can I get you?

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Hi.

111
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,640
Let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Sure.

113
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
No, that's okay.

115
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

116
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,080
Oh, we're out at the moment.

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,720
May I suggest some rye bread?

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Sure.

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
That sounds good.

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Do you have any cakes?

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,040
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

122
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,680
I'll just take a cheesecake.

123
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Will that be all?

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes.

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Your total is $43.20.

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,080
So, when you want to go buy some bread or some baked goods, you have to know how to

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
count those goods.

128
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,440
Okay, so today we have a couple of words to help you count bread.

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,480
The first one we have is dozen.

130
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
That's right.

131
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,720
So, for croissants, as you can see, it's a countable noun.

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,920
And so, when you ask for a dozen croissants, you're asking for 12.

133
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
That's right.

134
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
So, in English, the word dozen means 12.

135
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,920
You can buy a dozen eggs or in this case, a dozen blueberry muffins maybe.

136
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Okay.

137
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,620
So, it's a very popular term, a dozen or a half a dozen.

138
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,040
Sometimes people just buy six.

139
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
That's right.

140
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
So, half a dozen is six.

141
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,360
A whole dozen, just say dozen, is 12.

142
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,800
You can also have something special called a baker's dozen.

143
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
Yes, I've heard about this.

144
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
What is a baker's dozen?

145
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,480
Well, a baker's dozen is basically a present the baker gives you.

146
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,200
So, you buy 12, maybe 12 croissants and the baker gives you one more.

147
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Wow, so you get 13.

148
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes.

149
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
A baker's dozen is 13.

150
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,280
But do you ask for a baker's dozen or does the baker say, I'm going to give you the baker's

151
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
dozen?

152
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
I don't think I've ever asked for it.

153
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,320
I think when I've bought bagels and I say I want a dozen bagels, they give me a baker's

154
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
dozen.

155
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
They give me 13.

156
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Okay.

157
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,040
So, when you're buying bread, now obviously you don't really buy a dozen sourdough breads.

158
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,680
You buy a dozen loaves of sourdough bread.

159
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,240
So, the countable noun here is a loaf of bread.

160
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,600
One loaf, two loaves.

161
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Now, this is very interesting because in English, we don't have that many counting words, measure

162
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
words.

163
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Right.

164
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,920
But for bread, we do actually have this special word.

165
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,880
So, you can say, I would like two loaves of sourdough bread.

166
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Okay.

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,640
And a loaf or loaves in the plural, what is it exactly?

168
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,920
It's one big piece.

169
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,800
So, for example, you have maybe one little piece of bread.

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,840
It's called a slice.

171
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
That's what you eat.

172
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
But when you buy the bread, you have many, many, many slices together.

173
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,720
Before you cut the bread, that's called a loaf.

174
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Very good.

175
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,840
And this is the reason why the baker or the person attending the shop asked if he would

176
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,000
like to have the loaf sliced.

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,720
Would you like the loaf sliced?

178
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,880
That means, would you like us to cut pieces of bread from this loaf?

179
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
Because sliced bread is how you eat it.

180
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Right.

181
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Exactly.

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,480
You don't really take a whole loaf of bread and start eating it like that.

183
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Like an animal.

184
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
No.

185
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
You cut it into slices.

186
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,960
So, sliced bread, we say, is one option.

187
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,600
You can also have unsliced, which means when you go home, you cut it yourself.

188
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,240
So this is a very particular word as well because you have the adjective to have sliced

189
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,480
bread.

190
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,160
You also have the verb to slice the bread.

191
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,600
That means to cut it into slices.

192
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,720
And of course, you have the noun slices of bread.

193
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,640
So you have the individual pieces.

194
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,440
So it can be a verb, an adjective, and a noun.

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
That's right.

196
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,640
It can be a little confusing, but I recommend you all check out the website and practice

197
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,320
a little bit in the comments section.

198
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
All right.

199
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Good.

200
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:36,160
So let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

201
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,680
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

202
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
What can I get you?

203
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Hi.

204
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,080
Let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

205
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Sure.

206
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

207
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
No, that's okay.

208
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

209
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,520
Oh, we're out at the moment.

210
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,160
May I suggest some rye bread?

211
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Sure.

212
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
That sounds good.

213
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Do you have any cakes?

214
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,480
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

215
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,120
I'll just take a cheesecake.

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Will that be all?

217
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Yes.

218
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Your total is $43.20.

219
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
All right.

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:14,960
So speaking about breads now, there is some particular ingredients that we don't mention

221
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
in the dialogue, obviously.

222
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,640
But they're worth mentioning, what is the one main characteristic that most breads have?

223
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Yeast.

224
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Yeast.

225
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
That's right.

226
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Y-E-A-S-T.

227
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Yeast.

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,920
And yeast is actually alive.

229
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
It's an animal.

230
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,200
It's like a bacteria.

231
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
That's right.

232
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,400
And so you wonder why are some breads flat and why are some breads big, poofy, large?

233
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,920
Well, yeast is why.

234
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,040
Basically, you can't have a big poofy bread, a big, large, tall bread, unless you have

235
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,400
this yeast.

236
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,040
So yeast is what makes the bread rise.

237
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Yes.

238
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,920
And we also mentioned flour, which is basically just a powder made out of some type of grain

239
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
usually.

240
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Yeah.

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Usually it's made out of wheat.

242
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,600
Obviously, whole wheat is a little bit different from the white flour, which would be a different

243
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,240
processed wheat.

244
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,000
But we also have different things that you can even have rice flour.

245
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right.

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Corn flour.

247
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Corn flour.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,280
So corn bread would be, of course, yellow because corn is yellow.

249
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,520
Now, so you can hear that we say the word flour like a rose is a flower, but it's actually

250
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,080
spelled different.

251
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,880
F-L-O-U-R, flour.

252
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,600
So there's two different things.

253
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,320
There's flours in your garden and there's flour, F-L-O-U-R, which is something you can

254
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
cook with.

255
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
That's right.

256
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
These are called homophones.

257
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,760
So they basically have the same pronunciation, but very different spellings.

258
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,240
And very different meanings.

259
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Exactly.

260
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,160
So a very interesting lesson for us today.

261
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
Go out, get some bread, try some of these if you have them available.

262
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,800
But also, come to the questions and comments section and tell us about maybe your local

263
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
bread.

264
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,120
I know that many countries around the world have very specific types of bread.

265
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
That's right.

266
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,680
Write some names down for us, send us your pictures, and we'll see you on the website.

267
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
All right.

268
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Bye, guys.

269
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:15,040
That way we don't have to worry about typing out the whole disclaimer and come up with

270
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,040
all the answers at the end.

271
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,840
And we just love hearing from you.

272
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
That's right.

273
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,600
Thank you so much.

274
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, God.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,980
Oh, I saw that one.

276
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,320
That's good.

277
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,720
I'm not going to watch that.
