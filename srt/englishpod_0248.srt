00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,460
My name is Catherine and today we've got another lesson all about food and eating.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,880
So today we're going to talk about all the tools that we use when we're at the table.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,440
So what we use when we're eating.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
That's right.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,400
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and when we come back, we'll talk about some

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
of these words and some of the great phrases you're learning today.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Honey, can you set the table?

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Well, I'm sure.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
What are we having for dinner?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,960
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,720
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,880
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight, so set an extra place mat just in case.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Okay.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,080
Should I use the fancy silverware?

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,440
Yeah, go ahead.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,080
Forks, spoons, and knives.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,760
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,120
I'll also set some cups and sauces for some coffee after dinner.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,520
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,760
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,600
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
Oops.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,620
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,500
So now let's take a look at a couple of words in language takeaway.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,320
So our first word is a very important one.

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,680
You might have heard it before.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,080
The word is silverware.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
Okay, silverware.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,320
Now this means that it's usually made something that's made out of silver, right?

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
It could be.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,820
Maybe traditionally it's made out of silver, but it doesn't have to be.

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,320
You could have wooden silverware or other metals.

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,640
It's basically the things that you use to eat food with.

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,120
Okay, so we're going to take this as a category.

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,000
There are all the tools that we use to eat food with.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,320
So for example, a fork is a part of a silverware.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
It's a kind of silverware, fork.

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,680
A fork is the one that you usually put in your mouth with a piece of lettuce or meat

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
or something.

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Okay, so it's pointy.

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,120
It has like four little points.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Now the one that we use to have dessert or to have soup with, we call that a spoon.

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,640
A spoon, that's right.

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,240
So to eat yogurt or ice cream, you use a spoon.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,040
And finally, to cut things, you use a knife.

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,120
Okay, so in the dialogue we saw the plural form, knives, but singular it would be knife.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
That's right.

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,840
And sometimes there are foods that are very, very hard to cut.

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,080
For example, steak is very hard to cut because it's a tough meat.

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,480
And so in that case, we use a steak knife to cut it.

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,840
Okay, so we have a knife or a steak knife.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Steak knife more specifically is used to cut meats.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,280
All right, so these are three kinds or actually four kinds of silverware.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
Of course, there are other kinds, but those are the most important.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
After that though, we have something that's important for making your food taste better.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,840
So what if I want to add salt or pepper?

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,240
What are those things called?

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,580
Those are called salt and pepper shakers.

62
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,120
We saw them in the dialogue that we need to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,960
So the little thing where you keep the salt is called a shaker.

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,380
That's right, because the action, the verb is to shake.

65
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,680
That means moving your hand up and down so some salt will fall out onto your food.

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Exactly.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,280
So usually it's only salt and pepper that we keep in these things, in these little shakers.

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,600
But apart from salt and pepper shakers and all the silverware we're putting out, we're

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,320
also putting out some saucers because we're going to have coffee later on.

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay, so this normally goes together with cups, cups and saucers, but everyone knows

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
what a cup is.

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,960
What is a saucer?

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,720
So a saucer is this little plate that you put under the cup when you're having coffee.

74
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,840
So usually that's where you keep your spoon or maybe the little bag of tea.

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,260
Okay, so a saucer is important because it also helps in case you spill some coffee or

76
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,080
tea so the coffee or tea doesn't go on the ground, it goes on the plate.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Exactly.

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,360
So that little plate is called a saucer.

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,560
Now where do we keep all the plates, all the silverware?

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,800
We usually keep them in a cupboard.

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay, so you might want to say cupboard because it's cup, C-U-P-B-O-A-R-D.

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
That's not right.

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,400
The word is pronounced cupboard.

84
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Okay, so even though it may seem like you should pronounce cupboard, the correct pronunciation

85
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
is cupboard.

86
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Cupboard.

87
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Cupboard.

88
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,160
And a cupboard, like you said, is usually in the dining room or the kitchen because

89
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,840
it houses, it keeps all of our plates and bowls and sometimes our silverware.

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
That's right.

91
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Okay, so actually in the cupboard we also have some other things, dishes.

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,600
Specifically we have a gravy boat in there.

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,800
Okay, so I'm not even sure why they call it a boat, but a gravy boat is basically a special

94
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
dish.

95
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,480
It's like a tall bowl with a spout so you can pour it that keeps gravy.

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,360
So gravy is like a liquid or a sauce that goes on top of meat or potatoes.

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I guess it kind of looks like a boat.

98
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
Just imagine a boat, but inside it's empty.

99
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,440
So then that's where you put the gravy in.

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
You pour it.

101
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
You can pour it.

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,840
All right, and so we can find that.

103
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
We can also find serving dishes, which are basically big plates or bowls that we use

104
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,760
when we're having dinner at the dinner table to keep, for example, a turkey or a roast.

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
And specifically we were also looking for wine glasses.

106
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,920
Well, maybe we weren't looking for them, but they found us because the person getting stuff

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,400
out of the cupboard dropped some wine glasses.

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
These are very, very easy to break.

109
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,560
Wine glasses are basically just glasses that maybe are tall and you drink wine out of them.

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
That's right.

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,960
So there are specific type of glass usually used to drink wine.

112
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,840
So wine glasses, I guess a normal glass that you use to drink maybe juice or water is just

113
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
called a glass.

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Right.

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,200
So you can't use a wine glass only when you're drinking wine.

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Okay.

117
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,640
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here, a lot of tools that we use at the dinner table

118
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,000
when we're having dinner.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,440
So let's listen to the dialogue again and review.

120
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Honey, can you set the table?

121
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Sure.

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,360
What are we having for dinner?

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

125
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,560
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight.

126
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
So set an extra place mat just in case.

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Okay.

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Should I use the fancy silverware?

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,440
Yeah, go ahead.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,080
Forks, spoons, and knives.

131
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,560
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

134
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,720
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

135
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,800
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also the...

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Oops.

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
All right.

138
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
We're back.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:07:01,320
So now we have four key phrases that we've prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

140
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Fluency Builder.

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Okay.

142
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,200
So this first phrase is very important, especially as a child.

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
Your mother or father might ask you to do this.

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,520
The phrase is to set the table.

145
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Okay.

146
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,000
So that's a phrasal verb, to set the table.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,240
And what does it mean if you're asked to set the table?

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,320
It means you will put down the plates and the silverware and the bowls so that everything

149
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,920
is prepared for dinner.

150
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Okay.

151
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,160
So this is actually what we were doing and a complementary phrasal verb to this.

152
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,560
When you're setting the table, as you said, you are putting down or putting out the different

153
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,640
spoons, knives, dishes, all that stuff.

154
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Right.

155
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,880
So the verbal phrase to put out means to place down or to make sure that you get something

156
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,120
out on the table.

157
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,240
In this case, my mother would usually ask me to put out extra glasses for water.

158
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Okay.

159
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Or don't forget to put out the wine glasses in case we're drinking wine.

160
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,240
It just means to place down.

161
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Exactly.

162
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,000
So just remember that we use it because all these things, they're inside the cupboard.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,240
So you have to take them out.

164
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,760
So you have to put them out on the table.

165
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,880
All right.

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:15,320
And sometimes we may have a guest or we may need an extra chair or an extra seat because

167
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,920
we are having company and the person in dialogue said to set an extra placemat just in case.

168
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Okay.

169
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,120
So placemat is basically a piece of plastic or maybe fabric that you put in front of a

170
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,040
person when they're at the table.

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,400
So it's on the table and it's something that protects the table.

172
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
So it's small.

173
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,720
Everyone has one and the bowl and the silverware will go on top of that placemat.

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,480
But it also indicates that that is where someone will sit.

175
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Okay.

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,560
So to set out or to set out an extra placemat means to prepare an extra place for someone

177
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,120
else who will be coming.

178
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,200
So if you have a guest, for example, you'll set out an extra placemat for him or for her.

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Okay.

180
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,440
So we can say set an extra placemat because this is by this we are referring that somebody

181
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,120
is going to sit down at the table or you can just simply say set an extra place for someone.

182
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
That's right.

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Set an extra place.

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,760
Your older brother is coming home from college tonight.

185
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Okay.

186
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,840
So you set an extra place for him at the table.

187
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,080
And well, in this case, we didn't know if the brother was really coming or not.

188
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,860
So she said just in case.

189
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,840
This is a great phrase, one that you'll hear all the time.

190
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,520
It means I'm not sure what the result will be or what the outcome will be.

191
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,400
But in case something happens or just in case we should do this.

192
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,760
So for example, Marco, I think it's going to rain today.

193
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,040
You should bring an umbrella just in case.

194
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Okay.

195
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,000
So this is a way of saying you're preventing something.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
You're prepared.

197
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,160
Maybe if it does rain, you'll have an umbrella just in case.

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Bring your umbrella.

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Okay.

200
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,960
So a lot of great phrases there.

201
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
A lot of vocab.

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Honey, can you set the table?

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sure.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What are we having for dinner?

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

207
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,560
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

208
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,360
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight.

209
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,720
So set an extra placemat just in case.

210
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Okay.

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
Should I use the fancy silverware?

212
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, go ahead.

213
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,880
Forks, spoons, and knives.

214
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

215
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,960
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.

216
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,320
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

217
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,540
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

218
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,640
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there.

219
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Oops.

220
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:43,920
I'll be right back.

221
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
All right, we're back.

222
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,200
So talking about dinner and silverware, there are also a couple of other names that we didn't

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
mention.

224
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,200
For example, many people refer to ceramic plates as china.

225
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Yeah, these are usually the fancy kinds of plates and dishes that you have in your house.

226
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,280
Obviously, if you have just kind of the cheap ceramics that you can throw away or even paper

227
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,800
plates, those aren't very important.

228
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,320
But at a wedding or in a special occasion, a person or a family might receive chinaware,

229
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
china.

230
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,160
And that is very nice, very pretty porcelain plates or just lacquerware.

231
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,400
Okay, so you can call it chinaware, which is basically plates that are either very fine

232
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,200
ceramic or porcelain, as you said.

233
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
That's right.

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,080
Or what was the other word that you said before?

235
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Lacquerware.

236
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Lacquerware is a certain kind of plate or ceramic that has a kind of sheen to it.

237
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,920
It's very special, kind of basically paint job.

238
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,160
Oh, okay.

239
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah, because it's always been kind of strange the fact that a name like china would also

240
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,960
now be related to plates.

241
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,720
But apparently, I guess because Chinese porcelain is renowned as being such high quality, I

242
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,960
guess this is why now we just have a word for it called china or chinaware.

243
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,280
I think it actually has to do with the fact that the Chinese in the old days sold, well,

244
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,080
most of the British bought their porcelain from China.

245
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,080
And so it was very, very in vogue, it was very popular.

246
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,200
And it was basically the only thing that the British wanted.

247
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,960
They just wanted all of this china.

248
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,320
And it became a part of the vocabulary then.

249
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,880
Yeah, it's really strange though that you would call something china.

250
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,540
It's like, I don't know any other country that you call something, you know, like French.

251
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,800
This is a French or Frenchware.

252
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I don't know.

253
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
I can't think of any.

254
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,440
Limoges is the name of a city in France and it's a certain kind of ceramics.

255
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
Oh, there you go.

256
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
All right.

257
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
So an interesting topic.

258
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,880
There are many other tools that we didn't mention like salad fork and ice cream spoon.

259
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
I don't know.

260
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,000
And sometimes if you go to a fancy dinner, you will have maybe three spoons, three knives,

261
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,640
three forks and you don't know what to do with it.

262
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
Start on the outside and go in.

263
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
That's my one recommendation.

264
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Exactly.

265
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,840
So we're really curious to know what you have to say.

266
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,800
