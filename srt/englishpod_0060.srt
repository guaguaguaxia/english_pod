00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,680
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,840
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,280
And today we're bringing you our great suspense, scary series.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Our thriller.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,880
Our thriller, New Guy in Town, part four.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
All right.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,080
Well, I don't want to give you any hints about what will happen in this dialogue.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,120
Yes, it's totally unexpected.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,040
So let's listen to our dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about some of the great

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:38,040
vocabulary.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
All right.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,600
Drag her over here and help me tie her up.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,780
I can't believe she fell for it.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,120
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,080
Well, you got to admit my acting was brilliant.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,480
Whatever.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,600
I was the one that convinced her to come.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,520
Look, she's waking up.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
What's going on, Ellen?

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
What are you doing?

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,000
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,440
You can stop pretending now.

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,200
Yeah, Lois, we know who you are.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,320
Now we want some answers.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Why are you here?

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:35,320
You don't know who you're dealing with.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
You can't stop me.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:57,240
Well, I certainly didn't see that one coming.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,520
I know everyone thought that Armand was a vampire.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
I know.

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,960
And now it turns out that they were acting.

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Yeah, crazy.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Crazy, huh?

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Yeah.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Strange things happen here on EnglishPod.

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,760
All right, so why don't we take a look at some of the language that we saw in Language

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,520
Takeaway.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,920
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,560
Well, we have three words for you here that we heard in the dialogue.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,080
And the first one, Armand tells Ellen to drag her over here.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Right, drag.

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Drag.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,560
So when you drag something or somebody.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
You pull them across the floor or pull them across the ground.

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Pull them, but you don't actually pick them up, right?

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
No.

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Yeah.

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,800
Their body is still touching the ground.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,640
Okay, so just imagine if you have a really heavy suitcase, it doesn't have any wheels,

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
you got to drag it across the floor.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Yeah.

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Right?

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
I've been there.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Yeah, it's happened to me too.

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Yeah.

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
So drag.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
All right.

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,840
And then he says, tie her up.

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,040
Tie her up.

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,760
Tie somebody up.

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,720
So to tie somebody up.

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,520
To use rope and put it around a person so that they cannot move.

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Right.

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,960
So you take rope, you tie a person up.

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
And it's always used like this, right?

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,720
Tie somebody up.

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Yes.

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Tie him up.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Tie that up.

73
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Tie that up.

74
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Yeah.

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Okay.

76
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
And our last word.

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
I like this one.

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Fools.

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Fools.

80
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Fools.

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,960
So our singular would be fool.

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,740
Yeah, F-O-O-L.

83
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
So what's a fool?

84
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,280
Well, a fool is a stupid person.

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Right.

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
A person that doesn't know something.

87
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Yes.

88
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,520
Or an ignorant person.

89
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
All right.

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,720
Well, Lois thinks that Armand and Ellen are fools here.

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Exactly.

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,200
Apparently, she got really angry and managed to escape from the chair or whatever.

93
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
She was tied up, right?

94
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,640
Well, the dialogue was a little bit fast.

95
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,600
There was a lot of sound effects as well.

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah.

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

98
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

99
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,880
And I'm sure it's going to be a little bit easier to understand.

100
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,160
All right.

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,200
Drag her over here and help me tie her up.

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,440
I can't believe she fell for it.

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,560
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,760
Well, you got to admit, my acting was brilliant.

105
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,200
Whatever.

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,280
I was the one that convinced her to come.

107
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,320
Look, she's waking up.

108
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,680
What's going on, Ellen?

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,960
What are you doing?

110
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,120
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
You can stop pretending now.

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
Yeah, Lois.

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,120
We know who you are.

114
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,760
Now we want some answers.

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,440
Why are you here?

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,880
Fools!

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,760
You don't know who you're dealing with.

118
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
You can't stop me.

119
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,280
Run!

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,440
So Marco, I noticed in this dialogue, there's a lot of words and phrases that we can use

121
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,360
to talk about lying or fooling somebody.

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,560
Exactly.

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,960
There is a lot of language about lying.

124
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,960
So let's take a look at it in Fluency Builder.

125
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Fluency Builder.

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
All right.

127
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,360
So in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at four phrases.

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,440
The first one, fell for it.

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,920
Fell for it.

130
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,760
I can't believe she fell for it.

131
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,120
Fell for it.

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,480
Okay, so it's not that she physically fell, right?

133
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
No, no.

134
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Okay.

135
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,960
But she believed the lie.

136
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,000
She believed the lie.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You fell for the lie.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,440
I know that we have some examples so we can understand this phrase, fell for it, a little

140
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,280
bit better.

141
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,760
Example one.

142
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,520
He might seem like a nice guy, but don't fall for it.

143
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,840
He's a jerk.

144
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,880
Example two.

145
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,280
I can't believe I fell for your lies.

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Example three.

147
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,920
I told my mom I was going to the library and she fell for it.

148
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
All right.

149
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,960
Well, that's a lot clearer to me.

150
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,760
I noticed that we have the preposition it here.

151
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Yeah.

152
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
It is at the end and it's referring to the lie.

153
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Yes.

154
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,960
Or the joke or the story.

155
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Yeah.

156
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
She fell for the story.

157
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
But you wouldn't say she fell for the story.

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,440
You would say she fell for it.

159
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Yeah.

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
So these three words always, always, always go together.

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Fell for it.

162
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
So don't forget the it.

163
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Don't forget the it.

164
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Okay.

165
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,720
Let's take a look at our second word.

166
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,040
Gullible.

167
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,760
So Ellen thinks that Lois was gullible.

168
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Right.

169
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
A gullible person.

170
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Yeah.

171
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Gullible.

172
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,000
A gullible person is somebody that always believes.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They always fall for it.

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They always fall for it.

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They believe anything you say.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
So you were a little bit gullible when you were younger, right?

179
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Yeah.

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
That's true.

181
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
You know what?

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,640
My grandmother used to tell me every year she would say, oh, I'm 35.

183
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I'm 35.

184
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,680
And I really believed her until I was about 12 years old.

185
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Wow.

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
So you were really gullible.

187
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Really gullible.

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
But you're not anymore.

189
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
No.

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I know better.

191
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
All right.

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
So gullible.

193
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
A gullible person.

194
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Okay.

195
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Now let's look at the next phrase.

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
The cat's out of the bag.

197
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,880
The cat is out of the bag.

198
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
The cat is out of the bag.

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

200
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,280
So again, it's not literal.

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,600
It's not like you had a cat in a bag and you let it out.

202
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
No.

203
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,760
A nice idiom here, meaning the truth is out.

204
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
The truth is out.

205
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
We discovered the truth.

206
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Yes.

207
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,160
So imagine that the cat is the truth.

208
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Right.

209
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
And it escaped.

210
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Yes.

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Okay.

212
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
So the cat's out of the bag.

213
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
The truth is out.

214
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,720
We know the truth now.

215
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Yep.

216
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Okay.

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,080
So let's look at our last phrase.

218
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Pretending.

219
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Pretending.

220
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Pretending.

221
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,680
So Lois was pretending to be a normal housewife.

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,760
Let's listen to some examples of how we would use pretending.

223
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,560
Example one.

224
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
Pretend that you're my boyfriend and he'll go away.

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
Example two.

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,520
I can't believe Lucy pretended to be sick.

227
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,760
Example three.

228
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,480
You forgot my birthday.

229
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't pretend that everything is okay.

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Okay.

231
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,600
So pretending is acting like you are somebody that you are not.

232
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Yes.

233
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,360
Or, yeah, it's sort of like acting a lie.

234
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Okay.

235
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,520
So for example, on Halloween, everyone dresses up as a monster or Spider-Man or something.

236
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,280
So everyone pretends to be that character.

237
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Yes.

238
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
But they are not.

239
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Yes.

240
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Okay.

241
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Pretending.

242
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Pretending.

243
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Okay.

244
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,280
So let's listen to her dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk some more.

245
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,280
All right.

246
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:15,160
Drag her over here and help me tie her up.

247
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,340
I can't believe she fell for it.

248
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,720
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

249
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, you got to admit my acting was brilliant.

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Whatever.

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,080
I was the one that convinced her to come.

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,040
Look, she's waking up.

253
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
What's going on, Ellen?

254
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
What are you doing?

255
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,520
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

256
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,960
You can stop pretending now.

257
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
Yeah, Lois.

258
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
We know who you are.

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,840
Now we want some answers.

260
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Why are you here?

261
00:09:50,840 --> 00:10:04,480
You don't know who you're dealing with.

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
You can't stop me.

263
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:24,920
Run!

264
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,480
Okay so what do you think will happen in part five?

265
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,040
I have no idea.

266
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,800
Well what do you guys think will happen in part five?

267
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Actually Armand isn't a vampire anymore.

268
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
But Lois is a witch.

269
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
But Lois is a witch.

270
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Who's Ellen?

271
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
What sort of twist are we going to see here?

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Is she an alien?

273
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,760
Oh my God.

274
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,160
We don't know what will happen but you can tell us what you think will happen.
