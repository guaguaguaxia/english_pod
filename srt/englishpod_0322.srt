00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,720
My name is Catherine and you've probably heard us talking a little bit about small talk the

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
past few weeks.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
We have another episode about small talk and we're going to teach you some things that

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,640
you can say to people when you haven't seen them or maybe even met them before.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
That's right.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,920
Today we're going to talk to a stranger.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,800
So we're going to talk very briefly about some casual topic.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,000
And so let's jump into the dialogue and see what happens.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,280
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,840
No, please feel free.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Thanks a lot.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,400
Do you work in Shanghai?

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Yes, I do.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
How about you?

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
No, I'm a tourist.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,760
This place is amazing.

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,600
It's much bigger than I imagined and much more exciting.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,160
There's so much to see here.

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
You can say that again.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,920
It's much more modern than people imagine.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Where are you from?

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,320
Well, let's see.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,480
I'm from Kansas originally, a much quieter and more peaceful place than here.

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,200
That's for sure.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,840
But I'm living in Paris right now.

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Oh, Paris.

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Wonderful.

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,160
I'd love to visit sometime.

31
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,300
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,720
So now we're going to take a look at a lot of phrases on this occasion.

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,080
So let's go for fluency builder part one.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Fluency builder.

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
All right.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,440
So the first phrase we have is a very common phrase if you're in a train or on a bus.

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,720
You hear the phrase, is this seat taken?

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Right.

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,640
So Michelle came up to the stranger and said, excuse me, is this seat taken?

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,800
That means, is anybody sitting here?

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,480
It basically means, can I sit here?

42
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Right.

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,280
This is a very polite way of asking if you can sit down in the seat.

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,320
You can also say it in a restaurant, at a movie theater, in a classroom.

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,480
So remember this one.

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,520
This was a really, really common phrase.

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,240
So it's a very polite way of saying, can I sit down?

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
That's right.

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
You're asking for permission basically.

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,320
Is the seat taken?

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,040
Because what if a person says, well, no, it's not.

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
Do you have to say, may I sit down?

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
May I take a seat?

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,600
Well, if they say, I'm sorry, someone is sitting here.

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,840
That means that maybe they're waiting for a friend and then no, you can't sit there.

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,560
But if they say, sure, like in the dialogue, feel free, then you're really basically able

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
to sit down.

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
No problem.

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Right.

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
So the stranger answers by saying, no, please feel free.

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
So he says, no, the seat is not taken.

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Please feel free.

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
What does he mean by this?

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Okay.

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,440
Feel free is a very unusual phrase in English, but one that you're going to hear a lot.

66
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,160
It basically means do what you want to do.

67
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay.

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Okay.

69
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
So if I want to sit down, I say, is this seat taken?

70
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,240
If you say, feel free, Marco, that means feel free to sit down.

71
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Okay.

72
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,600
So we can complete the sentence by saying, no, please feel free to sit down.

73
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,120
But it's kind of stating the obvious.

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,560
You're saying basically feel free to do what you want.

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
That's right.

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
But you could use it in other ways.

77
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,760
For example, Hey Marco, are you using this pen right here?

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,120
No, no, feel free.

79
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,520
That means feel free to use my pen.

80
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Okay.

81
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Very good.

82
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,920
And so then they started talking about what they do, where they work.

83
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,560
And Michelle said, yes, I work in Shanghai.

84
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,880
How about you?

85
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,160
Oh, how about you?

86
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,000
Now this is a really important construction.

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,680
This is a really important phrase in English.

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,320
And I think a lot of people make mistakes with this.

89
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,880
So how about you means, do you work in Shanghai?

90
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,960
I just said I work in Shanghai, but how about you?

91
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Do you?

92
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Right.

93
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Exactly.

94
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,880
So that's saying, and you, do you work here?

95
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Or and you, what do you do?

96
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
How about you?

97
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,400
Now, the common mistake with how about you or using the construction how about is that

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,240
for some reason, some people seem to think that it means how is it?

99
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,360
So for example, if someone says, how about your weekend?

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
That's wrong.

101
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
No, we don't say that.

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,640
How was your weekend?

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,440
But in this case, how about you always follows a statement.

104
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Okay.

105
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,900
So yes, I do live in Shanghai.

106
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,900
How about you?

107
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,360
That means, do you live in Shanghai?

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Right.

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,460
If I say, I would like to eat a hamburger and French fries.

110
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
How about you?

111
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
How about you?

112
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
What would you like to eat?

113
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Exactly.

114
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,000
So remember, that's the way that you use how about.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,560
Never say how about your weekend or how about your vacation when you want to ask, how was

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
it?

117
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Don't say that.

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
No, basically, this is a way to reply to someone when they're telling you about their experience.

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,880
You want to talk about yours.

120
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
That's right.

121
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,640
Okay, so let's take a break.

122
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:42,400
Let's review everything and we'll be back with Fluency Builder part two.

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,520
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,080
No, please feel free.

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Thanks a lot.

126
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,720
Do you work in Shanghai?

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Yes, I do.

128
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
How about you?

129
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
No, I'm a tourist.

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,060
This place is amazing.

131
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,880
It's much bigger than I imagined and much more exciting.

132
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
There's so much to see here.

133
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
You can say that again.

134
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,240
It's much more modern than people imagine.

135
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Where are you from?

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
Well, let's see.

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm from Kansas originally, a much quieter and more peaceful place than here.

138
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
That's for sure.

139
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Uh-huh.

140
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,240
But I'm living in Paris right now.

141
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh, Paris.

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
That's wonderful.

143
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,280
I'd love to visit sometime.

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,360
All right, we're back.

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,960
So now let's continue with some more phrases on Fluency Builder.

146
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,720
Okay, this first phrase is one that I really like to use.

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
The phrase is from Michelle.

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
She says, you can say that again.

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
But she's talking about how Shanghai is so big and so exciting.

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,200
And Michelle says, you can say that again.

151
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,680
Now, what does this mean, Marco?

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
That's right.

153
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,040
So she is basically agreeing with the person.

154
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
The stranger says, Shanghai is amazing.

155
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
It's great.

156
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,200
There's so much to see.

157
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Michelle says, you can say that again.

158
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,080
It's saying, I agree with you.

159
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
You are so right.

160
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
I really agree.

161
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,920
All right, so this is very emphatic.

162
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,200
That means that it's really, it's more than just I agree.

163
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,520
I really, really agree.

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,280
The person really feels something about this, feels passionately about it.

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
That's right.

166
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,840
So if you go to the movies and you say, oh, that movie was terrible, you can say.

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,200
You can say that again.

168
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Exactly.

169
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It means, oh, I agree.

170
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
It was really bad.

171
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's right.

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now, when Michelle asked the stranger where he was from, he says, I'm from Kansas originally.

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Okay, what's originally?

174
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm original?

175
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
No.

176
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm from Kansas originally means maybe I don't live in Kansas now, but that's where I come

177
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
from.

178
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,560
Origin, originally.

179
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,360
That means, you know, at the beginning.

180
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Right.

181
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,720
And remember, Kansas, by the way, is one of the states in the United States.

182
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,760
And so he's saying he's from Kansas, but now he lives in Paris.

183
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,200
So that's why you say, I'm originally from Kansas, but I live in Paris.

184
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,800
All right, so Marco, you live here in Shanghai, but where do you come from originally?

185
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Originally, I'm from Ecuador.

186
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
All right.

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,320
And I'm originally from Chicago, but I currently live in China.

188
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
That's right.

189
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Okay.

190
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,280
And as he was talking about Kansas, he also said that, well, it's obviously a lot quieter

191
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
and more peaceful.

192
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,360
And then he ends his statement by saying, that's for sure.

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
That's for sure.

194
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,540
And this is a phrase that we use to add emphasis on something.

195
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,240
It's almost like saying, this is a really quiet, much quieter and peaceful place.

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
That's for sure.

197
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,960
It really is.

198
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,400
It's not like you're adding anything to the statement, like no meaning, but you're actually

199
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
kind of making it more strong.

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Right.

201
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,880
You're saying it's a fact.

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
It's a fact.

203
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,320
It's really this way.

204
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,560
So obviously, Kansas compared to Shanghai is a lot more quieter.

205
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
That's for sure.

206
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Mm-hmm.

207
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Or I could say that in Chicago in the winter, it's a lot colder than Shanghai.

208
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
That's for sure.

209
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Right.

210
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,160
So again, you're emphasizing on your statement, telling everyone that it's very, very much

211
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
like this.

212
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
That's how it really is.

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Okay.

214
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,680
So that's all the phrases we have for you.

215
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:16,600
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time.

216
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Excuse me.

217
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Is this seat taken?

218
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
No, please feel free.

219
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,440
Thanks a lot.

220
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you work in Shanghai?

221
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Yes, I do.

222
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
How about you?

223
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,920
No, I'm a tourist.

224
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,280
This place is amazing.

225
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,120
It's much bigger than I imagined and much more exciting.

226
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,720
There's so much to see here.

227
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,520
You can say that again.

228
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,480
It's much more modern than people imagine.

229
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Where are you from?

230
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
Well, let's see.

231
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm from Kansas originally, a much quieter and more peaceful place than here.

232
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
That's for sure.

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Uh-huh.

234
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,400
But I'm living in Paris right now.

235
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Oh, Paris.

236
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Wonderful.

237
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,720
I'd love to visit sometime.

238
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,520
All right.

239
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
So small talk with a stranger.

240
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,160
This is actually a very common scenario.

241
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,240
If in a bus, in a train, you sit next to a stranger, this is more or less what you're

242
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
going to talk about.

243
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Where are you from?

244
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
What do you do?

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Where do you live?

246
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
That's right.

247
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
And you don't even have to talk about this with a total stranger.

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,960
You could actually use this with someone that you're working with or just an acquaintance.

249
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,780
So basically, these are key questions that you would ask someone that you don't really

250
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,920
know very well.

251
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
That's right.

252
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,840
And as you can see, you're not really going into any deep personal questions.

253
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,400
It's very light conversation, very brief as well.

254
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
That's right.

255
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,260
And I would like to add that in American culture, people often think it's very rude to ask someone

256
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,120
how much do you earn, how much is your apartment, how much is your car.

257
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,480
So in small talk in American culture, and I think a lot of Western cultures, we don't

258
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,680
talk about money or religion.

259
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
So what religion are you?

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,280
So I think it's important to talk about things that are very simple.

261
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,520
What do you do for a living?

262
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Where do you live?

263
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
How's the weather?

264
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
These things.

265
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes.

266
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,400
This is exactly, I think, one of the main points that when you're learning a language

267
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,580
such as English, not only to understand the language, but also the culture.

268
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,680
It's very, very different, especially, for example, in Asian cultures where it's no big

269
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,220
deal if you go to the hairdresser and the hairdresser asks you how much you earn.

270
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,520
But in the United States or many Western countries, it's not something that you talk about your

271
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,280
salary or that you really ask.

272
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,640
It's kind of personal information.

273
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
It is.

274
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
And if you talk about it, you might make people very uncomfortable.

275
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,160
And so I recommend talking about some of the things that we've discussed here and some

276
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,840
of the things that we've discussed in other lessons in this series about small talk.

277
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
That's right.

278
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,600
And if you have any questions or any comments about this lesson, you can come and visit

Until next time.

282
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Bye.

283
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Bye.
