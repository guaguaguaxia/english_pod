00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,380
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,240
And today we are going to have a lesson that is going to be very useful when you arrive

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
late.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,760
Yes, well, we all have arrived late to something and we need a good way of saying sorry and

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,640
saying why we were late.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,280
So today we're not only going to be looking at vocabulary used to explain why you are

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,160
late but also some typical excuses of why people are late.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,760
Right, so some normal reasons for saying why you're late.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,040
Well, why don't we get started with the dialogue.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,720
Now we're going to hear five people in the dialogue.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,560
So at the beginning we'll hear the boss and the assistant and then we'll hear three people

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:59,120
who are arriving late.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:19,360
Where is everyone?

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,440
Scotch has called and said that he's running late.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,360
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,560
Guys, this is not acceptable.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,720
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10.

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,880
Not 10.01.

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,440
And definitely not 10.20.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,400
All right, let's get started.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,960
So the first thing I want to talk about is our-

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm really sorry everyone.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,160
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,920
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,480
All right, so well, good excuses in general, except the last one.

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,960
I don't think that's such a good excuse of why you're late, right?

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeah, I don't really think if I was the boss, I would be very happy with this employee.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,760
Yeah, I don't think coffee is that important.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,560
But some of the excuses were good and some of the language they used to describe the

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
excuses was really great.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,320
So let's look at that now in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,120
All right, on Language Takeaway today we have four words that we're going to be looking

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,840
at and well, let's get started with the first one.

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,160
So Joe called the office assistant and explained that she will be late because she got tied

39
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,920
up with a client.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,960
To get tied up.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,400
So I got tied up with a client.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,600
All right, this is a really common reason for being late, but why don't we listen to

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,040
some examples to help us understand what it means.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Example one.

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,120
Sorry, I'm late, honey.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,560
I got tied up at the office.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,000
Example two.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,520
I was tied up on the phone all afternoon and didn't get any work done.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,920
Example three.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,800
I got tied up in traffic on the way here.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,560
All right, so if you get tied up, it means that you get busy with something that you

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
can't avoid.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,840
Right, you're busy with something that's so important, it's like you are tied by a rope

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
to that thing.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
Okay, I got tied up.

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm sorry, I got tied up.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Yep.

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,720
All right, now the first person that arrived to the office will explain that there was

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,560
a huge traffic jam on the highway.

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,440
A traffic jam.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,160
A traffic jam.

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,280
A huge traffic jam.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
Now we understand traffic, right?

64
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,400
Cars, a lot of cars.

65
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Yep.

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
So a jam, it means that it was like blocked.

67
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
It was stopped.

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
It was stopped.

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Yep.

70
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,720
There were a lot of cars on the highway and they weren't moving.

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,200
So a huge traffic jam is a very, very big stopping of cars.

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:25,360
Now our next word explains why sometimes there is a traffic jam.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
Well we found out that there was a huge pileup.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
A pileup.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
A huge pileup.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
A huge pileup.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
Okay, a huge pileup.

78
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,120
Now if a pileup is another way of saying an accident, right?

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Yeah, an accident with many cars and they all get piled on top of each other.

80
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,280
All right, so many cars got into an accident.

81
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Yep.

82
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,520
So this could be a reason of why there was a traffic jam.

83
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,720
And also a reason for why you were late.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
All right.

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,960
Now the other person, Scott, also called and he said that he's running late.

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,440
He's running late.

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,600
He's running late.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm running late.

89
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,960
Now if I'm running late, am I actually running somewhere?

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
What am I doing?

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
What's happening?

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,920
You are going to be late and you know you're going to be late.

93
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Okay, I know I'm going to be late.

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,680
So I'll call you and I'll say, hey, I'm running a little bit late.

95
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, actually this is the most common thing I say when I'm going to be late and I think

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,080
it's really important to know how to use this phrase.

97
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,680
So let's hear some more examples.

98
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,640
Example one, Jane is running late.

99
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,240
She'll be here in 10 minutes.

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
Example two, traffic is really bad.

101
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,060
So I'm running late.

102
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,240
Example three, I'm running a bit late.

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,040
So please start without me.

104
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
All right, perfect.

105
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,600
So running late, a very common way of explaining that you're going to be late and well, it

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,160
makes you sound very native.

107
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,440
Yeah, it's a great phrase.

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,640
Now our last phrase that we heard, the reason why Scott was running late was because his

109
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,000
last meeting ran over.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,120
Okay, to run over.

111
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,480
My meeting ran over.

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,240
Now ran over, my meeting ran over, it means it went too far?

113
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
Well, when something runs over, it goes longer.

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,920
Okay, longer than expected.

115
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah, so a meeting can run over or an appointment can run over.

116
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,920
So I can say, my meeting ran over 15 minutes, I'm going to be a little bit late.

117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,520
That's right, a great excuse.

118
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Very good.

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,720
Five great words and well, I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue and understand

120
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,840
these words as they were used in the dialogue and then we'll come back and take a look

121
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,880
at more phrases.

122
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Where is everyone?

123
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,920
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

124
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,000
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,960
She said she got tied up with a client.

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,380
Sorry, I'm late everyone.

127
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,080
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

128
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,400
Morning everyone.

129
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,020
Were you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

130
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,360
There was a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.

131
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,000
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,320
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,200
Guys, this is not acceptable.

134
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,120
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10.01 and definitely not

135
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
10.20.

136
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
All right, let's get started.

137
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
So the first thing I want to talk about is our-

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm really sorry everyone.

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,640
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

140
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,480
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way too long.

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,640
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:46,720
Okay, we got some more great phrases for describing being late.

143
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,080
Let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

144
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
Fluency Builder.

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,360
When Jo called, she said she'd be there in a sec.

146
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
I'll be here in a sec.

147
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,500
I'll be here in a sec.

148
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,680
So when someone will be here in a sec, it means they'll be here very soon, right?

149
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,160
Okay, I'll be here in a sec.

150
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,700
I'll be there in a sec.

151
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,600
But what about this word sec?

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,520
It's a short way of saying second.

153
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
So sec.

154
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
A sec.

155
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,240
Now, it's an exaggeration obviously because you won't be there in one second, but you

156
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
just explaining that you'll be there very, very soon.

157
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,440
What about the difference between I'll be here in a sec and I'll be here in a minute?

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,680
Well, if you say I'll be there in a sec, it means like I'll be there in one minute, right?

159
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,360
But if you say, oh, I'll be there in a minute, it could be a minute or more like three or

160
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
four or five minutes.

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,880
Yeah, I think that's true.

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,680
Now, again, going back to this traffic issue, we saw that somebody was stuck in traffic.

163
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,480
To be stuck in traffic.

164
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,640
I got stuck in traffic.

165
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,920
Now when you're stuck in traffic, you can't drive because there are too many cars stopped

166
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
on the highway.

167
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
So you are actually in the traffic jam.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Yeah, you're stopped there for like 20 minutes.

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
You can't move.

170
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Okay, I'm stuck in traffic.

171
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm going to be late.

172
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,840
Really great excuse.

173
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,360
And the reason they were stuck in traffic was because traffic was backed up for miles.

174
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay, traffic is backed up for miles.

175
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,440
To be backed up for miles.

176
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,640
Now, if I say the traffic is backed up for miles, it means that it's very long or how

177
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
does that work?

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,600
Well, okay, imagine there is an accident and that has caused the traffic jam and the cars

179
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
are lined up for many miles behind you.

180
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,520
Okay, so it's backed up.

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,200
From that point, there are many miles of cars waiting to pass.

182
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,560
Yep, so it's backed up for miles.

183
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Very good.

184
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,600
So great phrases.

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,920
And I think it's appropriate for us to listen to the dialogue for the very last time and

186
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:59,040
then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this being on time issue.

187
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Where's everyone?

188
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,440
We're supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

189
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,340
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

190
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,240
She said she got tied up with a client.

191
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,560
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

192
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

193
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,000
Morning, everyone.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
Are you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

195
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,160
There was a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.

196
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,240
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

197
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,840
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

198
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Guys, this is not acceptable.

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,480
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10.01 and definitely not

200
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
10.20.

201
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,200
All right, let's get started.

202
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,080
So the first thing I want to talk about is our...

203
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm really sorry, everyone.

204
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,240
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

205
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,960
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

206
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,040
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

207
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:57,560
Well, Marco, I know that ideas about time and ideas about being late are different in

208
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
different countries.

209
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,520
Yeah, in different countries, people treat time or being on time in different ways.

210
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,240
Yeah, like I'm from Canada and I look at being on time really different than you do, right?

211
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,920
Yes, because for example, if you call for a meeting at nine o'clock, usually people

212
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,600
will be there at nine o'clock because the meeting will start.

213
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
In America.

214
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Right, in America.

215
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,320
Now, for example, in Latin America, we do have this, what we call sometimes the Latino

216
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
time or Hispanic time, which is like nine o'clock is like the time that everyone should

217
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
be there.

218
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,560
But until people get there, get their coffee and whatever, then it'll be 9.15, maybe up

219
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
to 9.30.

220
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,160
And I think it's a little bit even more noticeable when we're talking about social events.

221
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,680
Like if you go to someone's house for dinner in Canada, if they say, come to my house at

222
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,760
six o'clock for dinner, you'll be there at 6.05, right?

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Okay, yeah.

224
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,040
Yeah, usually you'll be there only a couple of minutes after the time that was specified

225
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,640
just to, you know, give the house owner a little bit of time.

226
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,800
But if we have a dinner invitation for six, we know that it's not really going to begin

227
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,040
eating at six, so people will get there at 6.30 or seven.

228
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,360
And of course, food isn't ready until like maybe eight or nine.

229
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,680
But in German countries, from what I know, you've got to be there.

230
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,240
If they say be there at six, you're there at 6.00, right?

231
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
Not 6.01.

232
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,480
And also, I think it's about when people start work, right?

233
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,520
How on time you have to begin work.

234
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,320
Sometimes it's acceptable to be 10 or 15 minutes so-called late, but in other places, you know.

235
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, North America, if you're supposed to start work at nine, you have to be at your

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
desk working at nine.

237
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
At nine.

238
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Yeah.

239
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,520
Yeah, see that in other countries, people get there at nine, get their coffee, maybe

240
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,160
take a quick glance at their emails or the newspaper and then, you know, start working

241
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,720
at around 9.30 or 10.

242
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,040
So I guess the important thing is to know what the tradition is in the country where

243
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
you are.

244
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Exactly.

245
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,040
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com and let us know how it works in your countries.

246
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,360
I know that many different countries have a different way of treating time, so share

247
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
it with us.

248
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
Yes, and remember, if you have any questions, please ask them at the website as well.

249
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,880
We're out of time today, but until next time, thanks for listening and goodbye.

250
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Bye-bye.
