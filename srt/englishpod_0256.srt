00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,880
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,120
My name is Kathryn and today we have another episode of our interview series lessons.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
That's right.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,400
Today we're taking a look at a very important aspect of an interview.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,580
We're talking about salary and money.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,580
That's right.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,120
So this is the end of the interview and we're starting to talk about details of the job.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
Let's check this out.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,440
Listen to the dialogue one time and when we come back we'll be talking more about what's

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,520
going on.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,360
OK.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, Miss Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone but there were

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,600
some details I'd like to clarify.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, feel free to ask me anything and I'll try to fill in the details.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Could I first ask about the remuneration package?

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,840
Yes, of course.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,240
That's quite an important point, isn't it?

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,440
As a junior sub-editor, we offer a starting salary of HK$150,000 per annum.

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,360
This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,800
I understand.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,960
And are there other bonuses included?

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,520
Well, apart from full health insurance, we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,400
to readership numbers.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,480
But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,360
Well, Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,080
The opportunity to work in Hong Kong with your company is the most important thing for

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
me.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Excellent.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,880
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,680
All right, we're back so let's take a look at a couple of words and phrases on Language

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,280
Takeaway.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
OK.

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,040
So, this first phrase is a set phrase.

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,880
That means these words often go together.

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,720
The phrase is remuneration package.

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
That's right.

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,560
A remuneration package.

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,840
Rebecca said, could I first ask about the remuneration package?

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,720
So what's an easier way to say this, Marco?

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,640
I guess basically the salary.

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
That's right.

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,160
But a package means that it's not just money.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,600
It's also some of the benefits or the bonuses.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,980
So this is a way to describe how a person is paid in general.

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,980
That's right.

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,800
So in the remuneration package that Rebecca is being offered, Mr. Parsons said that she

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,880
would get a starting salary of $150,000 per annum.

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
OK.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,800
So this phrase, starting salary, is another fixed phrase.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,520
We have a lot of these today.

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,680
That means these two words go together.

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
Starting salary.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
So salary is easy.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,680
It's the amount of money you make either per month or per week or per year.

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,960
But what is a starting salary?

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
How is that different?

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,680
Well, basically that's the money that you would start earning in the company.

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,700
But obviously with time it could change and you can get more money.

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,960
So this means that you will start making this much money, but it's possible that in the

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,640
future you will make more.

66
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,000
This is the starting salary.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,040
That's right.

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,920
And well, of course, as we said, it's $150,000, Hong Kong dollars, per annum.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,920
So now we're specifying how often you're getting this money per annum.

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,640
So if it were per month, this might be a lot of money.

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
That's right.

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,160
But this is how much money she will earn per year, per annum.

73
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,040
This comes from Latin.

74
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
That's right.

75
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
So per year.

76
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,920
So this is the remuneration package she's getting.

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,760
Not only is she getting $150,000 per annum, she's also getting a housing allowance.

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
OK.

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,360
So many of us had allowances when we were children.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,880
This means the money that your parents gave you each week, $5 or $10.

81
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,400
Well a housing allowance is a little bit different.

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,400
It means the money that your company gives you per month or per year to pay for your

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
apartment or your house.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
That's right.

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,640
So obviously the company is saying that, look, we're going to give you a certain amount of

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,880
money for you to pay for your house.

87
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,440
You don't have to really pay for your house.

88
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,500
We'll pay for it.

89
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,600
So basically it's a benefit.

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
It's a part of this remuneration package.

91
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,480
You get a salary and you get money for your house.

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,740
It's a pretty nice deal.

93
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
That's right.

94
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:23,160
And well also she's getting health insurance and she is also being offered a company staff

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,560
bonus scheme.

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
OK.

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
Bonus scheme.

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
A bonus is something extra.

99
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,740
It's on top of what you normally get.

100
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,520
But a bonus scheme indicates that the bonus changes according to how well you do.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
That's right.

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,920
So obviously he's specifying that the bonus scheme is linked to readership numbers.

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,560
So let's say for example Marco sells newspapers.

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
Marco, you sell on a good week a hundred newspapers.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
If you sell a hundred fifty, you get a bonus of ten dollars.

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,880
But if you sell two hundred newspapers, you get a bonus of fifty dollars.

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
That's right.

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
This is a scheme.

109
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
The numbers change.

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Very good.

111
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,480
So all of this that we've just talked about, to be clear, is our remuneration package.

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
We're talking about a salary.

113
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,640
We're talking about housing allowance, health insurance and even a bonus scheme.

114
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,120
So a package can include these things and much, much more.

115
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
CEOs get bigger remuneration packages.

116
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
They do.

117
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,240
And if you have children, sometimes a part of your package is education costs for your

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,800
children or a car or computers, things like that.

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
That's right.

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,920
So a lot of great stuff there talking about salaries and a little bit of negotiating it.

121
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,240
OK.

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,600
Well, I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

124
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes.

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Well, Miss Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,280
were some details I'd like to clarify.

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,640
Well, feel free to ask me anything and I'll try to fill in the details.

128
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,200
Should I first ask about the remuneration package?

129
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Yes, of course.

130
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,880
That's quite an important point, isn't it?

131
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,760
As a junior sub editor, we offer a starting salary of one hundred and fifty thousand Hong

132
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,080
Kong dollars per annum.

133
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,000
This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
I understand.

135
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
And are there other bonuses included?

136
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,160
Well, apart from full health insurance, we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked

137
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,040
to readership numbers.

138
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,080
But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

139
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Well, Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary.

140
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,640
The opportunity to work in Hong Kong with your company is the most important thing for

141
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
me.

142
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Excellent.

143
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,880
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?

144
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,520
All right.

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,120
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Fluency Builder.

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,240
So at the beginning of the dialogue, Rebecca is talking to Mr. Parsons about the job and

148
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,680
she says, you know, I don't really have that many questions, but when I talked to Miss

149
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,200
Childs about the job over the phone, there were some things she wanted to clarify.

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
So how did she talk to her?

151
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
She talked to her over the phone.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,880
So this is a really good phrase to specify that you received information or you did business

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,840
talking on the phone, not in person.

155
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,000
OK, so this is a bit strange because we use the preposition over.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,600
You could also say I'm on the phone.

157
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
That means I'm talking on the phone.

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,400
But over the phone means by phone.

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
That's right.

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,840
Not by mail or email or in person.

161
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,020
But we communicate, we talk over the phone by phone.

162
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,880
So sometimes, for example, people will see a TV commercial with a nice item or device

163
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,680
that they want to buy and they will purchase this object, maybe a DVD player over the phone.

164
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,360
They will call up this number and order it.

165
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,080
Or you can say, you know, I'm really sorry, Marco, but I don't feel comfortable talking

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,000
about my banking details over the phone.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's right.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
OK, so that means on the phone.

169
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,000
So then Mr. Parsons said, feel free to ask me anything.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,760
OK, feel free to ask me anything about the job.

171
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,640
OK, this is a phrase that I use all the time, and I think it's really important when you're

172
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,880
in a business context or a work context to say, listen, if you have any questions, feel

173
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,280
free to ask.

174
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,980
It means don't hesitate.

175
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,120
Don't be nervous.

176
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,200
If you have a question, just ask it.

177
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
That's right.

178
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,720
So feel free to ask.

179
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Don't worry about it.

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,920
Just ask me.

181
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,640
It's a very good phrase to give someone or to make someone feel more comfortable.

182
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Exactly, exactly.

183
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
All right.

184
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,680
And he said that I'll try to fill in the details.

185
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,400
OK, so this is an interesting phrase because fill in, you know, on a form, for example,

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,800
means put your name in a box or fill in some numbers.

187
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,500
But here the details, we think maybe maybe I don't know what the details are.

188
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,360
So to fill them in means to fill in gaps or some blanks.

189
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
So like, I don't know all the details.

190
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,520
Please tell me the information so that I will know them.

191
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
That's right.

192
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,240
So what he's basically saying is I know that you have an idea or a general overview of

193
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
how things are.

194
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
But if you ask me, I can tell you more specific things that fill in the details.

195
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,080
Or, for example, we're going to a party on Saturday night, but I don't know where the

196
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
party is yet.

197
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
How about on Friday?

198
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
I call you to fill you in on the details.

199
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Very good.

200
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,680
OK, so those are the phrases that we've prepared for you today.

201
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,120
I think we've taken a look at a lot of great vocab.

202
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,520
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk to you a little

203
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,520
bit more.

204
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:43,280
OK, well I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

205
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,920
Yes, well, Miss Charles did give me an overview of the position over the phone.

206
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,480
But there were some details I'd like to clarify.

207
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,280
Well feel free to ask me anything and I'll try to fill in the details.

208
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Could I first ask about the remuneration package?

209
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
Yes, of course.

210
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,520
That's quite an important point, isn't it?

211
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,400
As a junior sub-editor, we offer a starting salary of one hundred and fifty thousand Hong

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,720
Kong dollars per annum.

213
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,640
This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

214
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
I understand.

215
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,800
And are there other bonuses included?

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Well apart from full health insurance, we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked

217
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,640
to readership numbers.

218
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,200
But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Well Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary.

220
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,280
The opportunity to work in Hong Kong with your company is the most important thing for

221
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
me.

222
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Excellent.

223
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:44,040
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?

224
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,800
Alright so talking about salaries and remuneration packages.

225
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,360
Now is this a common word to talk about remuneration?

226
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes it is.

227
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,280
It basically means the way that you are paid for the work that you do.

228
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,440
So remuneration, it sounds like a big long word.

229
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,000
But in America I think we also just talk about salary or compensation.

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Compensation packages.

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Ok, so now when we talk about remuneration, we don't necessarily always talk about money

232
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,800
like in this case, right?

233
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,600
We can receive other benefits.

234
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
That's right.

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,160
And so a lot of times people think of the important parts of remuneration not just to

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,000
be the salary but also to be the benefits.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,400
And so benefits are not the money, they are the other stuff.

238
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,420
They're health care.

239
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,800
We said earlier a housing allowance, even bonuses and things like that or education

240
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
for your children.

241
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
These are extras and these are a part of the package.

242
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,520
Now what would you prefer?

243
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:43,480
To have a good remuneration package like these other additional benefits with a low salary

244
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,480
or would you prefer to have a high salary with not many of these benefits?

245
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,280
Well I think that it's nice to get the benefits and a lower salary because often times at

246
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,960
a company, like a big company, the company can get really good rates on health care.

247
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,680
So if I have to pay for my health care with my big salary, maybe it will cost me more

248
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
money.

249
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,160
But if my company pays with the company rate, that means the amount that they pay, then

250
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,840
maybe they can help me pay for these things much cheaper.

251
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,520
And so in the end I make more money.

252
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Yeah.

253
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,960
Actually I've heard some companies that offer great remuneration packages like if you have

254
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,660
children as you said they will pay for their education.

255
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:25,160
But many times they would even pay for their child care, like maybe a nanny.

256
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Some of them, some of the managers would receive maybe a fuel bonus.

257
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,600
So they would get, I don't know, $200 extra a month for fuel for their car if they drive

258
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
to work.

259
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,680
So I think companies can get a little bit creative and it's not that much that they're

260
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,160
actually spending but you take it as to being a really good benefit.

261
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Well that's right and it makes you more I think happy to work for that company because

262
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
you feel like they're taking care of you.

263
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,040
Not just they're giving you money, they're actually taking care of you and your family.

264
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
That's right.

265
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,760
So we're actually a little bit curious to know how remuneration packages work in your

266
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,960
company or maybe in your country.

267
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
That's right.

268
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
So please let us know.

269
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,240
You obviously don't have to tell us how much money you earn but if you want to tell us

270
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,760
how these things work, where you come from, our website is EnglishPod.com.

271
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
We'll see you there.

272
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
All right.

273
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Bye.

274
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:30,060
All right so thank you very much.
