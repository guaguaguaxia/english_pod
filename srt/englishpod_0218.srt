00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,800
My name is Catherine and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,680
It's kind of bitter, it's a little bit sad, but it's also kind of sweet.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,680
That's right.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,760
We have a lesson today all about getting a divorce or divorcing someone.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,720
So this is what happens when two people's marriage ends.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
They decide they want to leave each other.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
They have a divorce.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,320
Joanne, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay?

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,560
Let's just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly so we can go

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
our separate ways, all right?

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Fine with me.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,880
I just want to get this over with.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,040
It's important we make a clean break.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,320
I should have signed a prenup.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
What was that?

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Nothing.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Anyway, you're right.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,240
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,520
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,480
as well as the custody agreement.

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I keep the cat and you get the dog.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
So that's done.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Finally.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,160
Well, let's not go there, Joanne.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,280
Okay, so let's start with the record collection.

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,800
I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,520
Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,280
He's my grandfather and he never really liked you anyway.

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Whatever.

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,320
All right, I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
set.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
How typical.

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,120
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Fine.

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,040
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,480
What's next?

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,600
What about these old photographs?

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Which ones?

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Let me have a look.

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,880
Oh, wow, look at that.

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,920
That brings back memories.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Remember that?

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Our trip to Italy.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
I remember that day.

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,080
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain and we got caught in the rain.

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,720
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,340
I did take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
in the rain.

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,640
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,320
Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake?

56
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,960
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile

57
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
and try again?

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,360
I still love you.

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Oh, Jeff, I love you too.

60
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
The motorcycle?

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
But that's mine!

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
All right, we're back.

64
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:48,600
So now, why don't we take a look at six key words on Language Takeaway.

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,400
Language Takeaway Okay, Marco, this first word is what we call

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
an SAT word.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,280
That means it's very difficult, it's so hard that many high school students in America

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,880
study it before they go to college.

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Acrimonious.

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,920
So, the sentence starts off by saying, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,200
than it already is.

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,000
This divorce is very acrimonious, but let's not make it worse.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,960
Okay, so acrimonious would be bitter, very complicated.

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Hard.

75
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,520
So people, emotional about it, you know, people, Joanne and Jeff are getting a divorce.

76
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,480
They're very angry at each other.

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
So they're not having a peaceful divorce.

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
This is the opposite.

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,160
It's very bitter, it's very angry.

80
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Can you say this test is very acrimonious?

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Usually, relationships are acrimonious.

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,280
For example, ever since they had that big fight, Jeff and Joanne's relationship has

84
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
been very acrimonious.

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Okay, awesome.

86
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,160
So, acrimonious, a very hard word there.

87
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,880
As you say, many people study it to pass exams in order to go into college.

88
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
So now you know.

89
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,760
Now, moving on, we have a very common legal term.

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,160
When people are getting married, they want to sign sometimes a prenup.

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,680
Yeah, you said it's common.

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
You hear this a lot in movies and TV.

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
Yeah, with celebrities.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,400
Yeah, you read about celebrities.

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,680
So basically, a prenup is a short way of saying a prenuptial agreement.

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
Nuptial means having to do with marriage.

97
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Right.

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,720
So basically, if you sign a prenup, you are agreeing to certain conditions before you

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
get married.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
That's right.

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,720
It's a contract between future husband and future wife about what happens if they divorce.

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,800
For example, I decided not to get a prenup with my fiancÃ© because I don't think we'll

103
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
get divorced.

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,800
But maybe he decided to get a prenup because in case they divorce, he wants to keep his

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
car.

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Right.

107
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,880
So it usually happens a lot with celebrities, as we say, because they have a lot of money.

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,400
And if they get divorced, then usually it can get complicated, how much money the spouse

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
gets, etc.

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,360
So maybe their prenuptial agreement or prenup will be that if they get divorced, the wife

111
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,800
may get maybe a million dollars instead of a hundred million dollars.

112
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Exactly.

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,240
It's a way many people protect themselves financially in case of divorce.

114
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Very good.

115
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,680
Now, moving on, another legal term and related to money is an alimony.

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay, so let's look at the context of this word.

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,600
Joanne is talking and she says, my lawyer tells me you've accepted our alimony proposal.

118
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Alimony.

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,640
So this is probably something to do with money, right?

120
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,640
So she said that her lawyer has proposed an alimony and that's usually a settlement, an

121
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,320
amount of money that you agree on when you get divorced.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Right.

123
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,400
So this is exactly it.

124
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,440
In a divorce, this is how much money one person will pay the other.

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
That's right.

126
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,080
So if two people are married and when they get a divorce, their alimony may be the husband.

127
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,480
If he's got a lot of money, he will pay an alimony of $500,000.

128
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Right.

129
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,880
And so this is different from property, which is the next thing.

130
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,600
Division of property means that you talk about who will receive the car, the house, things

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
like that.

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Lands.

133
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Okay, very good.

134
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,440
So very complicated situations when you're getting divorced, the prenups and alimony.

135
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,360
But moving on, they were talking about custody as well.

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,800
Custody of maybe children, maybe custody of their pets.

137
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
That's right.

138
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,480
So you talk about alimony, this is money, property, which is things.

139
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
But what about people and animals?

140
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
This is called custody.

141
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,720
I want custody.

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,400
Custody means caring for something or looking after something.

143
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,320
You could say the child is in the grandmother's custody.

144
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,960
Okay, so in the care of the grandmother.

145
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
That's right.

146
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,280
So usually as well, when people get divorced, somebody gets custody of the children.

147
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Right.

148
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,680
So he wants custody, but he doesn't have a job, so she will receive custody.

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
You could say that.

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
In this case, though, we're talking about custody of pets, animals.

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Right.

152
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
In this case, it's animals.

153
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
But it's actually true, right?

154
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,000
People when they get divorced, they may ask the court for custody of their pets.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,480
And sometimes custody is what makes a divorce extremely acrimonious.

157
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
Yes.

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Who gets to keep the children?

159
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,840
Who gets to keep the pets?

160
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,520
Now moving on and a little bit away from legal terms, they were dividing up their property

161
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,360
and saying, well, I get to keep this, you get to keep that.

162
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,600
And Joanne said, I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

163
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Ha, so who cares about pets and money?

164
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I want the gramophone.

165
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Right.

166
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
All right.

167
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,460
So this is actually a word you don't hear very often anymore.

168
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,800
It's an old thing.

169
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,440
And that's what antique means, right?

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Antique is old.

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Right.

172
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
So antique, this is an adjective here.

173
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,920
It can also be a noun.

174
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,640
An antique table, an antique gramophone is something that's very old, like 100 years

175
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,800
old or 150 years old.

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,320
And a gramophone is one of those machines that you see in movies that play the old vinyl

177
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,880
records and has like a big horn where the sound echoes.

178
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
That's right.

179
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,920
So in the 19th century, early 20th century, people didn't have CDs or MP3s or iPods.

180
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,900
This is how they listened to music.

181
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,840
So you usually have a hand crank.

182
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,280
You have to turn the machine and then the music will play and you can dance and do whatever.

183
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Right.

184
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
So that's a gramophone.

185
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Now, moving on to our last word, Jeff said, you know what?

186
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
OK, fine.

187
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Keep the gramophone.

188
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
All right.

189
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll concede the silly gramophone.

190
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,960
So to concede.

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,520
To concede means to give up an argument.

192
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,400
OK, so you give up, you give in, you say, all right, take it.

193
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
That's exactly right.

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,120
So in this case, the argument is who will receive the gramophone?

195
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,360
They fight, they argue.

196
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,640
And finally, Jeff says, I concede.

197
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,360
OK, I give up.

198
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,520
You take it.

199
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,960
And is it only for things or can you also concede someone, like you say somebody is

200
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
right?

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,720
You can say that or in election, for example, there are two people who want to be president.

202
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,120
And the vote is counted and it's not clear who the president is.

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,600
And one person says, fine, I concede.

204
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
That means I give up.

205
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
You win.

206
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
OK, very good.

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
So to concede.

208
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
All right.

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
Six key words there.

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,160
They're very interesting, especially the legal terms.

211
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Very common.

212
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,640
And it's very it's very common and it's very useful for you to know next time you're watching

213
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,080
maybe a movie or something related to this topic.

214
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,920
Hopefully not the next time you're getting divorced.

215
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,920
But move let's move on now to four key phrases that we have for everyone on Fluency Builder.

216
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Fluency Builder.

217
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
Margo, let's get this over with.

218
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I'm tired.

219
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
I want to go home.

220
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
Let's get it over with.

221
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Come on.

222
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Just do it and get it over with.

223
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
All right.

224
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,160
So this is our first phrase in Fluency Builder.

225
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
To get this over with or to get it over with.

226
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,560
OK, so let's take that as a phrase.

227
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,000
And to get something over with means this just finish it quickly.

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Let's stop delaying.

229
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
That's right.

230
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,360
This is a this is a way to ask to finish something quickly or to stop something.

231
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,080
So for example, I have to go to the dentist later.

232
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,760
Maybe I really don't want to go.

233
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,960
I'll say to myself, oh, let me just get this over with.

234
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,800
And once it's done, I don't have to worry about it.

235
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
Or maybe you have homework to do.

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,600
And instead of doing it later, you're like, OK, I'm going to do it now and just get it

237
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
over with.

238
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
All right.

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,480
To get over with to get something over with.

240
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
OK.

241
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,040
And when they were talking about breaking up or separating, Joanne mentioned it's important

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,400
we make a clean break.

243
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,080
What does she mean by making a clean break?

244
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
All right.

245
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
We hear this phrase all the time.

246
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,920
It's a very important phrase in the relationships.

247
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,640
It means when two people leave each other, you don't then call them or see each other

248
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,360
or hang out.

249
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,900
It means a clean break.

250
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,560
You stop all together.

251
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,440
You stop something completely.

252
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,480
So you don't talk anymore.

253
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,340
You don't see each other anymore.

254
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,160
You completely just stop contact with each other.

255
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Exactly.

256
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,100
You can also say this about breaking something.

257
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,940
You could say it was a clean break.

258
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,140
When I broke my arm, it was a clean break.

259
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,760
There were no little pieces of bone or any problems.

260
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
It was a clean break.

261
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
That means completely broke.

262
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
OK.

263
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,520
So when we talk about clean break in a relationship, it means we completely break up.

264
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,240
We stop talking to each other and it's over with.

265
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
It's in the past.

266
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Exactly.

267
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
All right.

268
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,520
So moving on, they were talking and completely, you know, arguing about I get the gramophone,

269
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,280
I get the tea set.

270
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,280
And Joanne said, OK, fine.

271
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,100
I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary.

272
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,380
So you can hear her, I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary.

273
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,880
So to drag something out means to extend, to make something longer, to make something

274
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,080
take more time than it should.

275
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
OK.

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,920
So, for example, if someone's giving a speech, they may be dragging it out.

277
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Right.

278
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
And you're like, wait.

279
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440
So someone's giving a very long speech.

280
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,800
You're like, oh, my God, he's dragging the speech out so long.

281
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Yeah.

282
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
When will he ever stop?

283
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Right.

284
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,880
Or you could say in an argument, I'm tired of arguing.

285
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,420
Let's not drag this out anymore.

286
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Let's just stop.

287
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
OK.

288
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,440
So to drag something out is usually time related to make things longer than necessary.

289
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Exactly.

290
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
All right.

291
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,440
And for our last phrase, when Jeff was talking about the relationship, he says, I know a

292
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,280
relationship has been on the rocks for some time.

293
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
OK.

294
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,880
So the relationship was on the rocks.

295
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
OK.

296
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,520
So this is an interesting phrase.

297
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Think about rocks.

298
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,920
You know, you see rocks on the ground in the ocean.

299
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,040
Something that's on the rocks, in this case, means something that is not going well.

300
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Something that has problems.

301
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Not going smooth.

302
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Yes, it's not smooth.

303
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,000
So, when Jeff says our relationship has been on the rocks, he's saying we fight a lot.

304
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We have problems.

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not working.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,600
So, if I say, my company has been on the rocks recently, it means it's not doing very well.

307
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,200
Business is not going well.

308
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
OK.

309
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,360
So, you can use this for different things.

310
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,720
Now, obviously, you may have heard it before for drinks.

311
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,040
You say, scotch on the rocks.

312
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Right.

313
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
That's different.

314
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Be careful.

315
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,160
In that sentence, Marco's talking about ice.

316
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Right.

317
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Yeah.

318
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
So, that's different if you ask for a drink on the rocks.

319
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
But if you describe yourself or your company or relationship as being on the rocks, it

320
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
means you're having a tough time.

321
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
It's a bad situation.

322
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Exactly.

323
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,240
So, it's a very useful phrase.

324
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,480
I think that's very native, very colloquial if you say something like this.

325
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Absolutely.

326
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
It's a great phrase to use.

327
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I encourage you.

328
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,960
I mean, I hope that your situation, your work and your relationships are not on the rocks.

329
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,520
But I do hope that when you're practicing speaking, use this phrase a lot because it's

330
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,720
really, really colloquial like you say, Marco.

331
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Yeah.

332
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
It's really good.

333
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,680
So, I think we've taken a look at a lot of phrases, a lot of vocab.

334
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:28,240
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for one last time.

335
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:46,840
What was that?

336
00:14:46,840 --> 00:15:00,120
Exactly.

337
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,240
Madam please.

338
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,320
disco albums back. Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather

339
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,040
gave it to me. I believe that was a wedding present to both of us Joanne and

340
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,280
you hardly ever use it. He's my grandfather and he never really liked

341
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,680
you anyway. Whatever! Alright I'll concede this silly gramophone if you agree that

342
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,440
I get the silver tea set. How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver

343
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,360
tea set? Fine, I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

344
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,360
What's next? What about these old photographs? Which ones? Let me have a

345
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:49,320
look. Oh wow look at that, that brings back memories. Remember that? Our trip to

346
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,000
Italy, I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain and we got

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,720
caught in the rain. And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I did

348
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,560
take a picture of you standing there in that little alley smiling and laughing

349
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,720
in the rain. Oh we really did have fun back then didn't we? Oh Joanne, are we

350
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,640
making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for

351
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,120
some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again? I still love

352
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,800
you. Oh Jeff, I love you too. I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the

353
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,680
motorcycle. The motorcycle? But that's mine!

354
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:37,400
Alright we're back. So a very interesting dialogue all about divorce. Now this is a

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,600
very common situation nowadays in many countries such as the United States or

356
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,560
Europe. Divorce rates are very high lately like in the past 10-20 years. Yeah

357
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,720
they do say that since maybe the 70s or 80s divorce rates have been on the rise.

358
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,160
I think the average now in America is about 50%. Yeah it's like 5 in 10

359
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,600
marriages and in divorce. That's right. And then from what I understand or I

360
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:08,400
read once, I think out of those 50% that get divorced, if they remarry again the

361
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
probabilities of those that get remarried are again half. So most likely

362
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,680
people will get divorced at least twice. That's true. Although sometimes you meet

363
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,440
people who got married when they were very very young and they realized that

364
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,080
they grew up a little bit and their personality changed or their goals

365
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,240
changed and they divorced that one time but then later in life when they marry

366
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,680
again they know who they are. They get married again and it's better. So I think

367
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,360
the situations are all quite different but it is true that there are a lot of a

368
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,040
lot of divorces in America. What about Ecuador though? I mean is the divorce

369
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,200
rate similar? No not really. I think people are still a little bit more

370
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,800
old-fashioned in that sense like it was before you know it was even a little bit

371
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,240
taboo to be divorced. Yeah. But I don't think people get divorced as often

372
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,840
especially if people have been together for quite a while. That's one of the

373
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,080
things that surprises me a lot is I've met people who have been married 20-30

374
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,640
years and then get divorced. It's like what if it's like you've been through

375
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,440
the toughest times you know you've pretty much beat the odds and why do you

376
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,400
get divorced at such a late age? Yeah it does seem counterintuitive but it's

377
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,680
possible that they were unhappy for that time and they didn't want to affect

378
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,000
their children's lives. Right. So when their children go to college or leave

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,440
they say okay now I can I can you know make a big decision. I know in countries

380
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,600
for example such as Chile divorce is still illegal. I think in the Philippines

381
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,160
as well. Really? Yeah it's still illegal to get divorced. Is that because they're

382
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,120
very religious countries? I know Chile is not really that religious. I don't

383
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,200
know what it is exactly by law but a lot of people I think it may be legal now I

384
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
can't really remember very well I think one of our Chilean listeners can help

385
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
us out here but I know a lot of people used to annul their marriages because of

386
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,640
this. I see. So they would be like oh I put the wrong address so no this marriage

387
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,280
is not it's not valid. Right or I spelled my name wrong. Yeah yeah. Interesting. Well I'd be

388
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,120
curious to know as you said whether any of our Chilean friends know more about

389
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,600
this or for the rest of you in your country is divorce common? Is it

390
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,080
uncommon? Are there laws that prohibit or that allow divorce? Let us know on our
