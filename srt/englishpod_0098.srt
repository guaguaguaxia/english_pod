00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,440
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,980
And today, we are going to be teaching you a very important technique, especially for

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,280
the guys if you want to have good luck with the ladies, right?

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,280
Oh, Marco.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,400
Well, today's lesson is called that's flattering.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
Right.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,600
So we are going to be teaching you how to flatter someone.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
Okay.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,800
So what does it mean to flatter someone?

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,360
Well, basically, you're going to be giving compliments and you're going to make that

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,560
person feel good about themselves.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
That's right.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Okay.

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,560
So flattering.

18
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,800
Now, before we get on with this flattering lesson, we need to look at some vocabulary

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,080
in Vocabulary Preview.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Vocabulary Preview.

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
All right.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,360
On Vocabulary Preview today, we have two small words.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
So the first one is bar exam.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,920
The bar exam.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
The bar exam.

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,200
So the bar exam is that formal test that lawyers must do to become official lawyers.

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,280
Right.

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
So it's that final exam in order to finally become a lawyer.

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,080
Okay.

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,440
And what about our next word?

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,280
Well, we're also going to hear in the dialogue obnoxious.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Obnoxious.

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Obnoxious.

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Okay.

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,320
So this is an adjective.

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Yes.

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,840
And it means something that is really, really annoying.

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Okay.

39
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,920
So something can be...

40
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,000
So something can be obnoxious.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Or someone.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Or someone.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Very good.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,640
So now we have these two words that we're going to listen to in the dialogue.

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,040
And now let's listen to two people as they flatter each other in our dialogue.

47
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,240
Valerie.

48
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,320
Hi.

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,440
Wow.

50
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
How have you been?

51
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,880
It's been such a long time.

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Oh, Marlene.

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Indeed, it's been a while.

54
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,320
How have you been?

55
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Wow, you look amazing.

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I love what you've done with your hair.

57
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Really?

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Thanks.

59
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,680
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Look at you.

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,320
God, you haven't aged a day.

62
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
What is your secret?

63
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Come on.

64
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,360
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,360
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Yes.

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
My little Paul is finally a doctor.

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,320
They grow up so fast, you know.

69
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,440
He is such a handsome guy.

70
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,840
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

71
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
Thank you.

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
What about your daughter, Pamela?

73
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,120
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
Oh, yes.

75
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,560
She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
Such a lovely girl.

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,880
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

78
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,080
But of course.

79
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,560
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Same here.

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,960
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

82
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
That would be great.

83
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,160
Give me a call.

84
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
See you soon.

85
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Bye.

86
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Ugh.

87
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,760
I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:21,400
All right, so this is your typical, normal, everyday behavior that women show to each

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
other, right?

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Yeah, I think it's very common.

91
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,800
It's very hard to argue against this because I think everyone does it, or at least you've

92
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,720
heard maybe your mother or your son talk to her friends like this, right?

93
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,400
So pretend you like a person who you actually hate.

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Right.

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
You have to be courteous.

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
I don't know what you're doing to me now.

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,560
All right, no, I'm not.

98
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,800
But we can take a look at some of this great language, very rich language that we found

99
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,520
in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

100
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Fluency Builder.

101
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,560
All right, we're doing things a little bit different in this lesson.

102
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,000
So we're going to do two Fluency Builders.

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,520
And in the first one, we're going to focus on language you can use to flatter someone.

104
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Right.

105
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
So let's get started.

106
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,000
In the very first part of the dialogue, we heard Valerie say, I love what you've done

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
with your hair.

108
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I love what you've done with your hair.

109
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,880
I love what you've done with.

110
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
I love what you've done with.

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay, so if somebody says this, basically they're saying, I like the change you made.

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Okay.

113
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,480
And change not only to your hair, right?

114
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
It could be anything.

115
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,520
So I love what you've done with your new house.

116
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Okay.

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
Or I can say, I love what you've done with your garden.

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
It looks so beautiful.

119
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,960
So something that you've changed, you can use this phrase for.

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Okay.

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
And in this case, it's her hair.

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,620
So she is complimenting her on her hair.

123
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,400
We also heard Darlene say, you haven't aged a day.

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,440
You haven't aged a day.

125
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,920
You haven't aged a day.

126
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Okay.

127
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,080
So now she is saying that she hasn't gotten any older.

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
That's right.

129
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,400
To age is to get older.

130
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Okay.

131
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
So this is a very common way of telling somebody you look great.

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
That's right.

133
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
You look young.

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You look young.

135
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
You look great.

136
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
You haven't aged a day.

137
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
All right.

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,480
So then they talk about their kids and they're talking about the sun and they, and Valerie

139
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,640
says he's such a handsome guy.

140
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,720
He is such a handsome guy.

141
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
He is such a handsome guy.

142
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Okay.

143
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,480
So this structure is important because now I can change the adjective and I am saying

144
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,760
he is very intelligent.

145
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,200
He is such an intelligent guy.

146
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
That's right.

147
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,760
And then this is such a good day.

148
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
All right.

149
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Very good.

150
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,120
So now why don't we combine the two phrases that we've just heard?

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,000
I love what you've done with and he is such a, and let's listen to some examples.

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Example one.

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,040
We love what you've done with this place.

154
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,480
Such a beautiful room.

155
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,360
Example two.

156
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,240
I love what you've done with your hair.

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,680
Such a nice color on you.

158
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Example three.

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,420
I love what you've done with this space.

160
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,120
Such a wonderful garden.

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
Okay.

162
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,080
I really like how those two phrases can fit together.

163
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah, they are very good and now you can use them together or separately like in the dialogue.

164
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
That's right.

165
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,920
Now let's move to our final flattering phrase.

166
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,320
Valerie says that Darlene's son gets his looks from his mother.

167
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Right.

168
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,600
She says he gets his looks from his mother, of course.

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,480
He gets his looks from.

170
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Okay.

171
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,680
So when she says he gets his looks from, she is saying his appearance.

172
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,600
His positive appearance, his good appearance.

173
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Right.

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
His good looks.

175
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Okay.

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,800
So now we can change the noun and I can say he gets his intelligence from his father.

177
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Right.

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,200
And then he gets his beautiful singing voice from his mother.

179
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay.

180
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,640
So now typically you would say his mother, his father or maybe one of the grandparents,

181
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
right?

182
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Maybe, yeah.

183
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,120
But you wouldn't say he gets his good looks from his brother.

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
No, no, no, no.

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
No.

186
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Mother, father, grandma, grandpa.

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
All right.

188
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,400
So now that we've covered four great ways of flattering someone, let's listen to this

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
dialogue again but we're going to slow it down a little bit so you can pick up on these

190
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,640
phrases.

191
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,400
Valerie.

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,640
Hi.

193
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,800
Wow how have you been?

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
It's been such a long time.

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Darlene.

196
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Indeed.

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
It's been a while.

198
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
How have you been?

199
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Wow.

200
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
You look amazing.

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
I love what you've done with your hair.

202
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Really?

203
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Thanks.

204
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,680
I went to that hair salon you told me about but enough about me.

205
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Look at you.

206
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
God, you haven't aged a day.

207
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,320
What is your secret?

208
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Come on.

209
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,960
Well, I've been watching what I eat and I work out three times a week.

210
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,920
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

211
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,240
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

212
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
They grow up so fast, you know.

213
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,040
He is such a handsome guy.

214
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,440
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,160
Thank you.

216
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,960
What about your daughter, Pamela?

217
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,760
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

218
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Oh, yes.

219
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,160
She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico and we all attended.

220
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,240
Such a lovely girl.

221
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,360
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

222
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
But of course.

223
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,160
Well, it's been great talking to you but I have to get going.

224
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Same here.

225
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,560
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

226
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
That would be great.

227
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,760
Give me a call.

228
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
See you soon.

229
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Bye.

230
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Ugh.

231
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

232
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:06,240
Okay, so we see a lot of great flattering language in this dialogue but we also have

233
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,560
some really good language and phrases you can use in small talk in any situation.

234
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Right.

235
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,280
So maybe if you talk to a friend that you haven't seen in a while, we have some really

236
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,240
great phrases for, as you say, small talk.

237
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,520
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder, part two.

238
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Fluency Builder.

239
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,220
Okay, so let's start with the first phrase.

240
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,320
She says, Valerie, hi, wow, how are you?

241
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,760
It's been such a long time.

242
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,720
It's been such a long time.

243
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
It's been such a long time.

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,680
So basically here she's saying we haven't seen each other in a long time.

245
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Right.

246
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,840
But it kind of gives you that idea that she regrets not talking to her for such a long

247
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
time.

248
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,560
Yeah, she wishes she could have talked to her.

249
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,800
It's been such a long time.

250
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
How are you?

251
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,320
So a wonderful way to start a conversation.

252
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,320
So when they start talking about their kids, Valerie says, by the way, I heard your son

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
recently graduated.

254
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Right.

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,600
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

256
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,160
So this phrase, by the way, I heard, blah, blah, blah, is really, really useful.

257
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Right.

258
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Let's take a look at the first part, by the way.

259
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,440
So this is a way to connect two different ideas or to start a new topic.

260
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Exactly.

261
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,080
And now when she says, I heard your son recently graduated.

262
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,840
So we use this phrase, I heard, when we've got information that we're not sure about.

263
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Right.

264
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,600
And also you are demonstrating interest about a certain topic or a news event that you would

265
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
like to know about.

266
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Right.

267
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,560
And so basically you're asking the other person, tell me about this.

268
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Right.

269
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,160
So I can say, hey, by the way, I heard you got married.

270
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,280
So then I'd tell you all about my wedding.

271
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Exactly.

272
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,480
OK, so this is a very common way of talking to someone or getting some more information

273
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,960
from a person.

274
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,680
So let's listen to some more examples of by the way.

275
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
Example one.

276
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,160
By the way, I heard you've recently been promoted.

277
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Example two.

278
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,720
I heard your daughter just had a baby.

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,520
Congratulations.

280
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,000
Example three.

281
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,320
Oh, I heard you just got back from holiday in France.

282
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,720
All right, now, since these two ladies don't like each other very much, they want to end

283
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,080
the conversation, right?

284
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Right.

285
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
They want to end the conversation.

286
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,200
And, well, you want to end it in a polite way.

287
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Right.

288
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,040
So they use a really great phrase here.

289
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,720
They said, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

290
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Right.

291
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,440
So it's like, well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

292
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
So it's been great talking to you.

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
I've enjoyed talking to you.

294
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Right.

295
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,880
So this is a very polite, very subtle way of saying, hey, I have to go or bye, I can't

296
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
talk anymore.

297
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,040
Yeah, when you say that, you know that the conversation is ending.

298
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Exactly.

299
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,920
Now, she says, I have to get going.

300
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
What does it mean?

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Get going.

302
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
That doesn't make much sense.

303
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,840
Basically, it just means leave.

304
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Okay.

305
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I have to leave.

306
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,400
I have to get going.

307
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You should get going.

308
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
You're going to be late.

309
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Exactly.

310
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Okay.

311
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,320
Some really good small talk phrases that are useful in any situation.

312
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,780
So why don't we hear them again?

313
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,360
One more time by listening to the dialogue.

314
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Valerie.

315
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,120
Hi.

316
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Wow.

317
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
How have you been?

318
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
It's been such a long time.

319
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Darlene.

320
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Indeed.

321
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
It's been a while.

322
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
How have you been?

323
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Wow.

324
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
You look amazing.

325
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,440
I love what you've done with your hair.

326
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Really?

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Thanks.

328
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,080
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

329
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Look at you.

330
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
God, you haven't aged a day.

331
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
What is your secret?

332
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Come on.

333
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,360
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

334
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,320
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

335
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Yes.

336
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,640
My little Paul is finally a doctor.

337
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,320
They grow up so fast, you know.

338
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,440
He is such a handsome guy.

339
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

340
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,560
Thank you.

341
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,360
What about your daughter, Pamela?

342
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,120
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

343
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh, yes.

344
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,560
She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

345
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,640
Such a lovely girl.

346
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,800
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

347
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
But of course.

348
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,560
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

349
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Same here.

350
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,960
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

351
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
That would be great.

352
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
Give me a call.

353
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
See you soon.

354
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Bye.

355
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Ugh.

356
00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:04,360
I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

357
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
All right.

358
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Very good.

359
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,080
So now you have a couple of phrases that you can use to flatter someone, be it your friend

360
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,240
or somebody that you know or anyone.

361
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,800
And well, they are very, very useful and if you use them correctly, of course.

362
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Right.

363
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,800
And these phrases sound really honest and really natural, very native-like.

364
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
