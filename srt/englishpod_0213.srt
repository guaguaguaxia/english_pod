00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,900
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,480
My name is Katrin and today we have a sad lesson for you.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,880
This is an intermediate level lesson about what happens when a friend or family member

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
dies.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Exactly.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,040
So, we have a lot of words that are related to all the preparations for when somebody

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,840
dies and also some phrases that you can say to someone that maybe had a family member

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
who recently passed away.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,320
So before we get into all of this, we have a key word that we want to take a look at

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,160
now in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,160
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
Alright, so in Vocabulary Preview, you have that one word and it's the title of our lesson

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,440
also, funeral.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Funeral.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,560
So, funeral is an event.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,640
It's something that we have.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,160
So basically, a funeral is the time when we mourn someone who has died.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,960
It's a celebration of their life.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Right.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,180
So it's kind of like a ceremony where you respect that person that passed away, right?

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,160
Some people will talk about the person that passed away or maybe, you know, it's time

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,960
to maybe honor that person, to as you say, mourn and remember that person.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Right.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,920
So it's very common for people in different religions to have different traditions.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,160
In some religions, like I think in Christianity, you have a priest who will say some things

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,960
that are very traditional and then say some things about the person who died.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,320
Other religions have different ceremonies.

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Right.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,600
So today we're going to take a look at what happens in preparing a funeral.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Hi, Daniel.

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
How are you holding up?

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Thank you.

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm much better.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
How's that going?

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,560
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,920
There are many things that you have to arrange.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,600
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
do.

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,960
Have you brought a burial plot and a casket?

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
No.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,320
Wendy is being cremated.

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,560
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,160
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,720
I see.

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,960
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
You're doing a great job.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Thanks.

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,940
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed

53
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,720
will that will sort out any other legal matters.

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,360
All right, we're back.

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,780
So a pretty interesting dialogue and I'm sure you have a lot of questions regarding some

56
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,880
of those words and phrases that you heard.

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:57,320
So why don't we take a look at five key words on Language Takeaway.

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Language Takeaway.

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,560
So basically we have two friends in this dialogue who are discussing arrangements for a funeral

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,920
and one friend is asking the other about his preparations and asks if he's bought a burial

61
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
plot.

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,260
Okay, burial plot.

63
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,360
Now what is a burial plot and why would you buy one?

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
Well, a plot, P-L-O-T, plot is a piece of land.

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,440
So you can think about this logically, a burial plot, burial to bury is a place, a space

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,760
in the ground where we bury a person.

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,240
Usually you buy one of these at a cemetery, right?

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
That's right.

69
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,160
So cemeteries have some, usually a lot of land and you can pay for a piece of land.

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
A small portion.

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
A small portion, yeah.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
And that's a burial plot.

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,600
Okay, good.

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,520
And well, our next word is related to what you put into this burial plot, right?

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Somebody dies and what goes into this piece of land is a casket.

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
That's right.

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,400
And I don't know if any of you are fans of the TV show Six Feet Under, but you'll know

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,000
from this TV show that there are many different kinds of caskets.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So a casket is a box.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,120
You can have fancy caskets or you can have wooden caskets that are very simple, like

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
pine.

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,520
And basically this is the box that the person's body will go into when they're buried.

83
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Right.

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Very good.

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,680
So that is called a casket.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,200
Well moving on, a new trend I would say in many countries and many people around the

87
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,560
world don't want to be buried.

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
So what happens?

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,200
You get cremated.

90
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,580
Cremated.

91
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,840
So this is the option for people who are not buried.

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,220
In some countries, China for example, I don't think you can be buried.

93
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,400
You have to be cremated because there's an issue of space.

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,520
And this is an option for most people where basically your friend or your loved one, their

95
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,000
body is burned and you can collect the remains afterwards.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They're very small.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They're ashes.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,280
So it's like a burning process.

99
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,320
Okay, interesting.

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,560
So the word is to be cremated, to get cremated.

101
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,600
Yeah, his body was cremated.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,520
And well as you said, you take the ashes and you can put them in a cremation urn or just

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
an urn.

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,380
Okay, urn.

105
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,980
This might sound like a strange word to you.

106
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,760
But an urn is a special kind of pot, okay, or a vessel to hold things in.

107
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,960
So for example, in this case we have a cremation urn that is a special pot, usually very beautiful.

108
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,680
Sometimes there's a name on it with the deceased person's ashes, his or her remains.

109
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,080
Okay, very good.

110
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,320
So as you said, it's kind of like a vase or a pot, something very nice and small where

111
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
you have the person's ashes.

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,800
All right, so now we know what happened during the funeral.

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,400
We know what happens, how you maybe cremate the person or you put them in a casket.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
And well, what happens afterwards?

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,200
Well, afterwards you have a memorial service.

116
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,440
Okay, so many people want to know what's the difference between a funeral and a memorial

117
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,920
service.

118
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,120
In my mind, a funeral is very quiet and sad and you have some respectful words and you

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,400
usually put the casket into the ground or have some kind of ceremony.

120
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,280
But a memorial service is an opportunity to talk to friends and family, to eat some food,

121
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
to have some drinks, to talk about the person who died.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
It's almost like the party, if that makes sense.

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,960
Yeah, exactly.

124
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,040
It's a get together of people who obviously are trying to give support to their friends

125
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:49,160
or their family members who lost that person, but also to talk about that person in a good

126
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,120
way and all the great memories they had.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I guess that's why it's called a memorial service because you remember and you give

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,200
out your memories about that person.

129
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Exactly.

130
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Okay, great.

131
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,560
So a lot of interesting words there, very specific to this topic, but obviously really

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
important.

133
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,040
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again.

134
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,280
Hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

135
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Thank you.

137
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm doing much better.

138
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,320
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
How's that going?

140
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,320
There are many things that you have to arrange.

142
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,040
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
do.

144
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
Have you brought a burial plot and a casket?

145
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,760
No, Wendy is being cremated.

146
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,960
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

147
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,600
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

148
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,160
I see.

149
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,320
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

151
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
You're doing a great job.

152
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Thanks.

153
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,400
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,480
will that will sort out any other legal matters.

155
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,680
All right, we're back.

156
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,840
So we have a couple of phrases, four to be exact, that we want to take a look at now

157
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,560
in Fluency Builder.

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Fluency Builder.

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,480
Okay, this first phrase is a very useful one if you're trying to ask someone about maybe

160
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,440
how they're feeling or someone who's had some problems recently.

161
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,000
You can ask them how things are going.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,280
One person says to the other, hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

163
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Right.

164
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,640
How are you holding up?

165
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,980
Now you know that to hold up something means to have it in your hands, but in this case

166
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,280
you're talking about how are things going?

167
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,800
Right, but I wouldn't say, hey, how are you holding up?

168
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Right.

169
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You wouldn't say that to somebody, right?

170
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
If normal circumstances.

171
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,960
If Marco looks really happy, I won't ask him.

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,600
But if someone has passed through a very difficult period, for example, if someone dies in their

173
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,040
family or perhaps if they've been very sick or there's some negative or difficult things

174
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,400
that happened, you can say, how are you holding up?

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,620
So basically means how are you dealing with this difficult situation or how are you dealing

176
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,200
with your illness?

177
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
How are you holding up?

178
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Or how are you holding up with your in-laws?

179
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Right, exactly.

180
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,540
How are you dealing with that difficult situation?

181
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,800
And then the person complimented this by saying, and this is a very good phrase, this whole

182
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,520
sentence is very useful if you want to say something nice to a person that has recently

183
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,920
lost someone.

184
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,040
You say, I am greatly sorry for your loss.

185
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,240
Okay, so you might have heard the word loss before, lose, loss.

186
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,840
Loss is a noun, it's a thing.

187
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,160
We normally say this about people who have died because you don't want to say, I'm really

188
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,720
sorry for your dead brother.

189
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,920
It's sad, it's very rude, too direct.

190
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,640
So in English we say, I'm greatly sorry for your loss, for this part of your life that

191
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,520
has gone away.

192
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,800
You can also say, I'm very sorry for your loss.

193
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:16,400
This is a standard phrase for funerals and memorial services.

194
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,740
So if somebody's brother died, you go up to that person and you can say, I am greatly

195
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
sorry for your loss.

196
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,960
I am very sorry for your loss.

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
That's what you say.

198
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,080
And it's very respectful and it's very nice to say.

199
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,280
Yes, it's very nice.

200
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:35,760
All right, so now moving on, we've said that the person is sorry and everything, but then

201
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,840
they were talking about the girl Wendy and that she had life insurance and that she also

202
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,920
left behind a detailed will.

203
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,320
Does that mean she forgot it?

204
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,080
She forgot it, but that can mean that, right?

205
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Right.

206
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,560
This is a phrase that has a couple different meanings.

207
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,360
And so it's important to look at this one when we're talking about someone who has died,

208
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
who left behind something.

209
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,000
It means that they have completed it in this case or it survives them.

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,540
So they left that for you.

211
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,400
Because as you said, it has a couple of different meanings like to leave behind can be to lose

212
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
or to forget.

213
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,600
But in this case, specifically, it's to leave for you.

214
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Yeah.

215
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,400
For example, you could say he died and he left behind three children.

216
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,000
That means that he had three children when he died and they're still alive.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Right.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,720
Very interesting phrase, to leave something behind.

220
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,360
And so she left behind a detailed will and that's going to sort out any other legal matters.

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
To sort out.

222
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,480
This is a great verb.

223
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,840
This is a verbal phrase that we hear a lot with documents and wills and things like this.

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:03,080
Basically, to sort out means to solve problems or to fix or to amend.

225
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,800
For example, have you sorted out that problem you had with your plane tickets?

226
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Okay.

227
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
To sort out.

228
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,480
So have you fixed those problems or have you solved those problems that you had with your

229
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
plane tickets?

230
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,560
To sort out, to fix, to make arrangements for.

231
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,800
Very, very useful phrase.

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Very useful phrase.

233
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Okay.

234
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,840
So four key phrases there, really good ones.

235
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:30,160
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

236
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,680
Hi Daniel.

237
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
How are you holding up?

238
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,040
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

239
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Thank you.

240
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
I'm doing much better.

241
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,960
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

242
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
How's that going?

243
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,640
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

244
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,960
There are many things that you have to arrange.

245
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,680
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to

246
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
do.

247
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
Have you brought a burial plot and a casket?

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
No.

249
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,400
Wendy is being cremated.

250
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,600
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

251
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,200
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

252
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,840
I see.

253
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,080
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

254
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

255
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
You're doing a great job.

256
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Thanks.

257
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,040
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed

258
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:33,440
will that will sort out any other legal matters.

259
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
All right, we're back.

260
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,360
So now, talking about funerals, there's an interesting word.

261
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,560
What is it called when a person speaks at a funeral?

262
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,040
Well, normally at a funeral, a loved one or friend will give a eulogy.

263
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Eulogy.

264
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Eulogy.

265
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Okay, that's E-U, right?

266
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
E-U.

267
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,680
It looks like a funny word, but it's very important and it's something that you hear

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
a lot.

269
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080
Who will give the eulogy?

270
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,320
Or his son will give the eulogy.

271
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,800
So this is maybe the keynote address in a funeral.

272
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,080
This is the important speech where someone will discuss the person who has died and his

273
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,040
or her contributions and life.

274
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Right.

275
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,160
Okay, so that's called a eulogy.

276
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,040
It's really interesting because it's kind of a word that you don't really use much and

277
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,240
you wouldn't really know it.

278
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,600
For example, I didn't really know about it until I saw it in a movie when he made a mistake.

279
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
He said googology or something like that.

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Oh, really?

281
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah, it was in a comedy.

282
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,360
But very interesting words.

283
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,440
It's a sad topic, but it happens sometimes.

284
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,680
You have to deal with these things and so if you have to do it in English, well, what

285
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,880
better way than to learn all of these things which could come in handy sometimes.

286
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
That's right.

287
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,240
And you never know, you're watching a movie or something and this comes up.

288
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,800
There are a lot of comedies, like you said, we call them black comedies.

289
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
It means they're very dark and strange.

290
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,000
And they, like Four Weddings and a Funeral is a very famous English movie about this

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
kind of thing.

292
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,880
And so this is useful vocabulary and some useful phrases for those situations as well.

293
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Exactly.

294
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,800
And I remember I met somebody who, I remember I knew somebody who met a casket salesman.

295
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Really?

296
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Sold caskets.

297
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
That's an interesting job.

298
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,480
Yeah, so you never know.

299
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
You never know.

300
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,880
Well, I hope you've enjoyed this lesson.

301
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,380
Not too dark for you, but please do remember to ask us any questions or practice some of

302
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,680

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680

Bye.

305
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:42,560
Have a good week.
