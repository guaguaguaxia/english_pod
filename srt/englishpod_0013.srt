00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,700
My name's Erica.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,700
And I'm Marco.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,520
So, Marco, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,520
I'm great.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm really happy to be back, ready to deliver another great podcast for all our listeners.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,660
That's right.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,740
And we've got an intermediate lesson today about spending money.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, specifically spending money in a company.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,420
We're going to be listening to a business meeting as a company describes how they're

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,420
spending money.

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,420
Right.

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,240
And they're actually looking at their profit and loss statement.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,920
So that's kind of interesting.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,800
Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a profit and loss statement?

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Yeah, sure.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,240
Well, all companies come out with a profit and loss statement every year or every three

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
months.

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,680
And it's basically a document that shows all the money that the company is spending and

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,780
all the money that the company is earning.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,560
So it's a document that outlines how much money the company makes and how much it spends.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Right.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,240
So in the end, basically, it'll tell you we're making money or we're losing money.

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Okay.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,200
So we're going to be listening to some people discuss a profit and loss statement in just

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,660
a moment.

28
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,560
But before we do that, it's time for vocabulary preview.

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Vocabulary preview.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
Okay, great.

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
So today on our vocabulary preview, we have two words for you.

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,960
So let's take a look at the first one.

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Expenses.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Expenses.

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Expenses.

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Expenses.

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,960
So expenses are things that you have to spend money on regularly.

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Right.

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,280
So for example, in a company, regular company expenses are salaries or office supplies or

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,160
the phone bills, internet bills.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Okay.

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,120
Maybe in a household or a family, your expenses might be your food, perhaps your transportation

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,240
or your rent or your heating bill.

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,440
So these are all things you spend money on regularly.

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
They're expenses.

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Expenses.

47
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Great.

48
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,960
Let's take a look at our second word.

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Through the roof.

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,680
Through the roof.

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
Through the roof.

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,860
Through the roof.

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,800
So when something is through the roof, it's...

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Really really really really high.

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Really high.

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
So for example, we can talk about gas prices are through the roof lately.

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
Yeah, that's totally true.

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,880
Gas prices have gone really high in the past couple of months.

59
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,800
So when we talk about through the roof, it means that the number is really high.

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
That's right.

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,060
We typically use this word with numbers.

62
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,240
It also gives you the idea that the number has risen really quickly.

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Yeah, exactly.

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Okay.

65
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
So through the roof.

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Through the roof.

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,000
All right, Marco, do you think it's time for the dialogue?

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
Yep, let's listen to the dialogue.

69
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,840
As always, the first dialogue is going to be a little bit fast, so it might be a little

70
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
bit difficult, but...

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,520
Don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we will explain all of the key language

72
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,520
in a minute.

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,680
Okay, so now the last point on our agenda.

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,520
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Great.

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,880
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

77
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,240
Let's see.

78
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,920
These numbers are off the charts.

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,240
What's going on here?

80
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Look at these bills, for example.

82
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,920
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

83
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Thank you.

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
I'll look into it.

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,280
The list goes on and on.

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatment.

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Thank you.

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
That will be all.

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll take care of it.

91
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Look at this one, sir.

92
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,080
$5,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Things?

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay, I get it.

94
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:01,600
Okay, so this accountant, she's pretty thorough, hey?

96
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,720
She's really persistent about her job, and the manager apparently is a little bit embarrassed.

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
I wonder why that could be.

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Well, we'll talk about that in a little while.

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Why don't we take a look at our language takeaway for today?

100
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,840
Language takeaway.

101
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,720
In today's language takeaway, we're going to look at three words, and the first word

102
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
is expenditures.

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,280
Expenditures.

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
Expenditures.

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,640
Expenditures.

106
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,800
So expenditures sounds pretty close to expenses, right?

107
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,720
It's pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference.

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,720
So why don't we listen to some examples and see if we can understand?

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Example one.

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:57,360
If elected president, I will increase expenditures on health and education by 12%.

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,200
Example two.

112
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,480
We really need to control our travel expenditures.

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,680
From now on, all managers will fly economy class.

114
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,040
Example three.

115
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:20,880
Because of the rise in oil prices, expenditures on food are higher than they have ever been.

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
So expenditures is the total amount of money that you're spending on something.

117
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Right.

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,520
That's the total amount of money versus expenses is the things that you spend money on.

119
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
Okay, that's really clear.

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,640
Our next word is out of control.

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,960
Out of control.

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,000
So when something is out of control, it's crazy.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can't control it.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Exactly.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't stop it.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can't stop it.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Out of control.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, great.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,720
Now, let's take a look at our last word for today.

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Go over.

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,480
Go over.

132
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Go over.

133
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,720
Go over.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,360
So go over is a pretty simple word.

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,640
Why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand go over?

136
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,760
Example one.

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,960
I need to go over this report one last time to make sure there are no mistakes.

138
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Example two.

139
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,440
Can you help me go over my presentation?

140
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,920
I want to make sure it's perfect.

141
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Example three.

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,840
Let's go over these numbers one more time and make sure there are no mistakes.

143
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,960
Yeah, this is a really common word and it basically means look at carefully.

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Yeah, or review.

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,280
In English, we often find simple little words, they fit together really well.

146
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,080
And you think, oh, they're so easy, like the word go over, so easy.

147
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Yeah.

148
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,120
But it's the way that they interact with each other that makes them...

149
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Or it makes you sound much better.

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Exactly.

151
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,400
So go over, in this case, we might say, let's go over the lesson.

152
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Let's go over the lesson.

153
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,960
Yeah, that sounds great.

154
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah, and that's a more natural way of saying something like that.

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, so we've taken a look at our language takeaways for today.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,280
I think it's time to listen to the dialogue one more time.

157
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,940
And this time, the dialogue will be slower so we can understand and listen to all the

158
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,760
words we just talked about.

159
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Okay, so now the last point on our agenda.

160
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,320
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

161
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Great.

162
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:57,400
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

163
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,260
Let's see.

164
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,160
These numbers are off the charts.

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
What's going on here?

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,220
Well, um, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

167
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,840
Look at these bills, for example.

168
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,200
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

169
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Okay, thank you.

170
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,120
I'll look into it.

171
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,960
The list goes on and on.

172
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,480
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatments.

173
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Thank you.

174
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
That will be all.

175
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,920
I'll take care of it.

176
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
Look at this one, sir.

177
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,520
$5,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Things?

178
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,560
Okay, I get it.

179
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,240
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

180
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,960
Okay, so I got it.

181
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,120
Yeah, it's clear now.

182
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,600
Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue that I'd like

183
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,200
to look at now in Fluency Builder.

184
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Fluency Builder.

185
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Great.

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,640
So today on Fluency Builder, we have three words for you.

187
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's start by looking at the first one, off the charts.

188
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
Off the charts.

189
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
Off the charts.

190
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,200
Off the charts.

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,440
So this word is very similar to through the roof.

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Exactly.

193
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,080
It also means really high.

194
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Right.

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,360
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use off the charts in a different situation.

196
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,720
Example one.

197
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:50,320
Oil prices have gone up and our costs are off the charts.

198
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,720
Example two.

199
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Excellent job, Susan.

200
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,920
Your sales are off the charts this year.

201
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,400
Example three.

202
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,320
Our losses are off the charts.

203
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
That's it.

204
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,280
No losses for anyone.

205
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,280
So Marco, do you think I can change off the charts for through the roof in these examples?

206
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,800
Yeah, you can.

207
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Definitely.

208
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,680
You can use off the charts or through the roof.

209
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
Both of them mean the same thing.

210
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Okay.

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,540
So two ways of saying really, really, really high.

212
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
Really high.

213
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,400
But they're very commonly used in a business setting.

214
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah, that's true.

215
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay.

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,680
So this next word is a phrase that you can use if you want to tell somebody that you'll

217
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,040
check something or you'll investigate something.

218
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Right.

219
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,200
And we heard it in our dialogue.

220
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,800
So let's listen to the clip.

221
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,320
I'll look into it.

222
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll look into it.

223
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
So look into that.

224
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,160
That means I'll check something.

225
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,960
Yeah, I'll see what's happening.

226
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah.

227
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Does it mean you're going to take action?

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
No, it doesn't.

229
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Okay.

230
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,080
So I think we've got another word that does mean you're going to take action.

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,280
I'll take care of it.

232
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,520
I'll take care of it.

233
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,000
So this word means that you're going to do something about it.

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,080
I'll take care of it.

235
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
I will take responsibility.

236
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Exactly.

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,120
So I will do something about it.

238
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
I will investigate and I'll do it.

239
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah.

240
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
Again, two great phrases.

241
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I'll look into it.

242
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,840
I'll take care of it.

243
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Okay.

244
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,340
So now let's listen to the dialogue a third time.

245
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,040
It's going to be at its normal speed, but now you have all the tools you need to understand

246
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
it a lot better.

247
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,840
Okay.

248
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
So now the last point on our agenda.

249
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,600
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

250
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Great.

251
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,120
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

252
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Let's see.

253
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,040
These numbers are off the charts.

254
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,360
What's going on here?

255
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,880
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,680
Look at these bills, for example.

257
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,080
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Okay.

259
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Thank you.

260
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I'll look into it.

261
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
The list goes on and on.

262
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,240
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatment.

263
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Thank you.

264
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
That will be all.

265
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,320
I'll take care of it.

266
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,880
Look at this one, sir.

267
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,160
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Things.

268
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Okay.

269
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
I get it.

270
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll do a very thorough analysis.

271
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,480
Marco, I guess one of the benefits of being an executive in a company, especially a large

272
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,200
company, is you get a lot of amazing benefits.

273
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,360
Yes.

274
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,280
When you are a manager or a CEO of one of these big companies, you get a lot of great

275
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,520
things like, I don't know, a private jet maybe.

276
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,920
Well, that's nice.

277
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,880
Or the company often pays for your house.

278
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Yeah.

279
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
Or for your car, they'll give you a company car.

280
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,080
They'll pay for your kids' or your children's tuition for high school.

281
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,600
So there are school fees.

282
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah.

283
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Yeah.

284
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay.

285
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,160
Also, I've heard about entertainment bonuses.

286
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Yeah.

287
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,280
So you can go out to a restaurant, get the receipt, and claim the expenses at work.

288
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,960
Those are some great benefits, right?

289
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,280
So Marco, I'm curious to know what our listeners' expenses are.

290
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Yes.

291
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,080
We definitely want to know what crazy expenses you have.

292
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
For example?

293
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
Well, let's see.

294
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,720
My spending on Coke Zero has gone through the roof since we started this podcast.

295
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Yes.

296
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,840
You spend a lot of money on Coke Zeros every week, right?

297
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Yeah.

298
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,320
I probably have about, I don't know, 10 a week.

299
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,120
Well, for example, I spend a lot on DVDs each week.

300
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,240
I usually buy two or three movies.

301
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
That is off the charts.

302
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,440
That is off the charts for DVD spending.

303
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,520
So we want to know what you spend your money on.

304
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,080

305
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080

308
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Great.

309
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
So we'll see you there.

310
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
And until then, it's goodbye.

311
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Goodbye.
