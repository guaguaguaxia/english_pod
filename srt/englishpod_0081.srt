00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,320
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,280
And today we're going to be going to one of those places that is really common, right?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
That's right.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,920
We're going to the hair salon.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,680
The hair salon or maybe also called a barber shop.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,640
I guess in this case it's a barber shop because it's a man who's getting his hair cut.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,480
Okay, so before we see what happens in this barber shop, let's take a look at some of

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,080
the vocabulary we might encounter in Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,600
Okay, we're going to look at two words that you'll hear in this dialogue.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
And the first one is trim.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Trim.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
A trim.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,020
All right, so when you trim something.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,160
You cut just a little bit of it.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,940
All right, so if I go to the hair salon to get a trim.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,640
You are going to cut only a little bit of your hair.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Okay.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,880
You're not going to change the style and make it look different.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, so a trim.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,240
And I think here we've seen that it can be a verb and a noun, right?

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,560
Okay, so I'm going to get a trim.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Yes.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,800
Or I want you to trim my hair.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
That's right.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
All right.

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,280
And what about our next word?

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Fancy.

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Fancy.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Fancy.

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
So fancy.

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,220
Now, we know that this word maybe is related to something like luxury.

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,320
Or formal or something like that.

36
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Right.

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,160
So in this case or in this context, we're going to be using it a little bit different.

38
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
That's right.

39
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,080
Here in this dialogue, we'll hear nothing too fancy.

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,320
Or nothing too complicated.

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
Nothing too different.

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,640
Okay.

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,760
So we don't want anything too fancy.

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
All right.

45
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:52,720
With these two words in mind, I think we're ready to listen to the dialogue.

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,800
Hello there.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Come on in.

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Don't just stand there.

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Come and take a seat.

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Okay.

51
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
Well, I just want a trim.

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Nothing too fancy.

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,880
Oh my gosh.

54
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,280
Your hair is amazing.

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,720
So silky.

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
So shiny.

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,200
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,520
You hear me?

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,000
You are going to look like a million bucks.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,080
Okay.

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,640
Can you make sure my sideburns are even?

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,760
And you just take a little at the top.

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Don't you worry.

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,840
I'll take care of everything.

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Oh my God.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
I just love your curly hair.

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,700
It's so fluffy and cute.

68
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,920
You should totally let it grow out.

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,520
An afro would look great on you.

70
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Um, no.

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Okay.

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,920
But you are going to be my masterpiece.

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay, so I think maybe his haircut is not quite what he expected.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120
I think he trusted the stylist a little bit too much.

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,600
I think the stylist had too many Red Bulls or something.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
He was very hyper.

77
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
Maybe that was his problem.

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
All right.

79
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,880
So why don't we take a look now at some of the language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Language Takeaway.

81
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,640
So I guess the stylist really thought this guy had nice hair, right?

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,480
Yeah, we heard how he described his hair.

83
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
He said it was so silky.

84
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Silky.

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Silky.

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
All right.

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,880
So we know the word silk, a material, very soft and smooth material.

88
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,800
And when something is silky, it's very soft and smooth.

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
All right.

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
So silky hair.

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Or silky skin.

92
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
All right.

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
So silky.

94
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,320
So he said he had silky and shiny hair.

95
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Shiny.

96
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Shiny.

97
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Shiny.

98
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
All right.

99
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
So we know what shiny is.

100
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Do we?

101
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Yes, we do.

102
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Okay, what?

103
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
So something that is shiny is you can see yourself in it.

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,960
Like gold is shiny.

105
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,480
Or silver is shiny.

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
All right.

107
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,840
Or if you look in the back of a CD, it's shiny.

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Yeah.

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,880
So the light bounces off things that are shiny.

110
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
All right.

111
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Now, getting into more hairstyle vocabulary, he wanted to make sure that his sideburns

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
were even.

113
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Sideburns.

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
All right.

115
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
So sideburns.

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
All right.

117
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,240
Well, sideburns are things that men have, right?

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
All right.

119
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Women don't have sideburns.

120
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
No.

121
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Okay.

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,640
So sideburns are the hair that grows on your cheeks near your ears.

123
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Okay.

124
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Those are your sideburns.

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes.

126
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,200
And now also, the hair stylist suggested that he should let his hair grow out.

127
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
Grow out.

128
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Grow out.

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Let your hair grow out.

130
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
All right.

131
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,560
So what does that mean exactly?

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,200
Let your hair get longer.

133
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,600
So you can say, let your hair grow.

134
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,840
But I guess it's more common to hear, let your hair grow out.

136
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,200
Well, maybe it just means something a little bit different.

137
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,880
If I let my hair grow, I might let it grow a little bit.

138
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,240
It might get a little bit longer.

139
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,080
But if I let my hair grow out, maybe it's short now and I'll let it get really long.

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Okay.

141
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,880
So to let your hair grow out is to really change the length.

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,960
All right.

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Very good.

144
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,480
So let your hair grow out.

145
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,400
And our last word on language takeaway today, afro.

146
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Afro.

147
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,440
Afro.

148
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,120
So if this guy let his curly hair grow out, he would have an afro.

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,400
An afro, right?

150
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,960
So now this hairstyle was very popular in the seventies.

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
That's right.

152
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,960
It's like a big, round, curly, fluffy ball of hair.

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Exactly.

154
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,280
So that's an afro.

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
We'll post some pictures on the website for you to get a clear idea of what this looks

156
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
like.

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
All right.

158
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,120
So I think now we are ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time, and then we'll

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:23,800
come back and look at some phrases.

160
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
Hello there.

161
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
Come on in.

162
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Don't just stand there.

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,840
Come and take a seat.

164
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Um, okay.

165
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, I just want to trim.

166
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Nothing too fancy.

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Oh my gosh.

168
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,200
Your hair is amazing.

169
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,360
So silky.

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,520
So shiny.

171
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,360
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

172
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
You hear me?

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,160
You are going to look like a million bucks.

174
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Okay.

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,440
Um, can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top?

176
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Don't you worry.

177
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,960
I'll take care of everything.

178
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Oh my God.

179
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,400
I just love your curly hair.

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,380
It's so fluffy and cute.

181
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,400
You should totally let it grow out.

182
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
An afro would look great on you.

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Um, no.

184
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Okay.

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
You're going to be my masterpiece.

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,760
Okay.

187
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:24,640
So we have some phrases here that you might hear in a hair salon or in a barber shop.

188
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,760
So why don't we look at those now in Fluency Builder.

189
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,000
Fluency Builder.

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,560
The hairstylist said, don't just stand there.

191
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Don't just stand there.

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
All right.

193
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,360
Don't just stand there.

194
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
So this is an interesting phrase, Marco.

195
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,880
I mean, it's made up of really simple words, right?

196
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Right.

197
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,440
But actually those words make it in order that's a little bit different.

198
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,560
So why don't we hear a few examples to help us understand how to use this phrase.

199
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,740
Example one.

200
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't just stand there.

201
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,440
Help me take these boxes into the house.

202
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Example two.

203
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
The house is on fire.

204
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Don't just stand there.

205
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Call the fire department.

206
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:16,240
Example three.

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Don't just stand there in the rain.

208
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Come inside.

209
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay.

210
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,920
So basically we can understand that if somebody tells you don't just stand there, they are

211
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,280
expecting you to do something.

212
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,440
We might use this phrase when somebody is not doing what we think they should do.

213
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Okay.

214
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
When action is required.

215
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Exactly.

216
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Okay.

217
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,080
So why don't we move on to our next phrase now?

218
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
Look like a million bucks.

219
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
You look like a million bucks.

220
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,440
So when someone looks like a million bucks, they look really, really good.

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Yeah.

222
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,720
So that is a very common way of just saying you look very good.

223
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,460
Or something looks like a million bucks.

224
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,280
So it can be for a person or a thing, right?

225
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Exactly.

226
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Okay.

227
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
And our final phrase.

228
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,440
And this one is really common in barber shops.

229
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,920
Take a little off the top.

230
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,440
Take a little off the top.

231
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,760
Take a little off the top.

232
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,160
So that basically means cut a little bit on top.

233
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Exactly.

234
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,480
And now can I say take a little off the sides?

235
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Yeah.

236
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
You can say that as well.

237
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Alright.

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
So take a little off the top.

239
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,040
Take a little off the sides.

240
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Okay.

241
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,640
So with all this great hair cutting language, why don't we listen to our dialogue one last

242
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,040
time?

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,120
Hello there.

244
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Come on in.

245
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Don't just stand there.

246
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Come and take a seat.

247
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Okay.

248
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
Well, I just want to trim.

249
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Nothing too fancy.

250
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,200
Oh my gosh.

251
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,560
Your hair is amazing.

252
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
So silky, so shiny.

253
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

254
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,800
You hear me?

255
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,120
You are going to look like a million bucks.

256
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,400
Okay.

257
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,080
Can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top?

258
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Don't you worry.

259
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,120
I'll take care of everything.

260
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,760
Oh my God.

261
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,480
I just love your curly hair.

262
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,980
It's so fluffy and cute.

263
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,240
You should totally let it grow out.

264
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,840
An afro would look great on you.

265
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,440
Um, no.

266
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay.

267
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:44,600
But you are going to be my masterpiece.

268
00:10:44,600 --> 00:11:02,040
All right, so now talking about hairstyles and different types of hair, there are some

269
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,520
interesting ones that maybe aren't so fashionable anymore, right?

270
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Yeah.

271
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,840
Actually, English has a lot of really cool words to describe haircuts.

272
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,240
So let's start with a couple of them.

273
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
For example, a mullet.

274
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
A mullet.

275
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,960
So this is when your hair is really short on top and really long in the back.

276
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Right.

277
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
So the sides and the top are really short, but the back, you have long hair.

278
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah.

279
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,720
In Canada, we call that a shorty shorty long back.

280
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,160
Shorty shorty long back.

281
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Yeah.

282
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,800
We also call it hockey hair.

283
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Hockey hair.

284
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Or even all business up front, all party behind.

285
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,880
Well, Canadians are obviously very into this hairstyle.

286
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,280
It's unfortunately true.

287
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
All right.

288
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,200
We also have, for example, a mohawk.

289
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Hmm.

290
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
Popular amongst the punk rock kids.

291
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Exactly.

292
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,720
So you shave your head on the sides, but you leave a little like stripe of long hair on

293
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
top.

294
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Of sticking up long hair.

295
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Okay.

296
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
And that's a mohawk.

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
What about a flat top?

298
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Oh, popular with law enforcement agents and serial killers.

299
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,400
So basically it's short hair on the sides.

300
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,480
And short and flat hair on the top.

301
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Right.

302
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
So your hair...

303
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Kind of looks like a box.

304
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Right.

305
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Like a box haircut.

306
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,000
I do not have a flat top for all of you out there.

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,960
But I did used to have a crew cut.

308
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Oh, crew cut.

309
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
A crew cut.

310
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Yeah.

311
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Like an army haircut.

312
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Right.

313
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,320
So very short on the sides and a little bit long on top.

314
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Yeah.

315
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Okay.

316
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,640
And our last one, my actual personal least favorite haircut.

317
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Dreadlocks.

318
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Dreadlocks.

319
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
All right.

320
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,120
So dreadlocks are like knots of hair, right?

321
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Yeah.

322
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
Like you haven't washed your hair in about seven years.

323
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,640
Right.

324
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Those are dreadlocks.

325
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,080
Very popular among Rastafarian.

326
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,680
Sure.

327
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,080
Or like young hippie kids.

328
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Yeah.

329
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Hippies, right?

330
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Yeah.

331
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Very good.

332
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
So what about in your countries?

333
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
What different hairstyles are popular there?

334
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,920
I know that Japanese hairstyles are really cool.

335
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Yeah.

336
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
That's right.

337
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Japanese haircuts can be pretty awesome.

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Right.

339
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
So tell us all about it.

340
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Come to our website.

341
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920

343
