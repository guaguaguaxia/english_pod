00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,840
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,960
So Marco, today we're talking about rent and housing.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Right.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,520
We're actually going to be moving.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,800
We're going to be going to a new apartment or a new house.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,600
And so we're going to look at all the words related to this because sometimes it can be

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,880
a real hassle, right?

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,280
It can be really difficult.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
Absolutely.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Well, you love moving, right?

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,400
You were telling me how much you love moving your stuff and negotiating a new lease.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,880
Well, I like the negotiation of the lease, but not the moving aspect.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,600
No, I don't think anyone likes moving.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
Actually, I do like it at times because then you can just throw away so many things that

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
you have no need for and you wouldn't throw away unless you moved.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,280
So let's go check out today's dialogue to find out what happens to the characters.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, that's fine.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
Bye.

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
What happened?

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
That's it.

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
My lease is up.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
I have to move.

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
What?

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Why?

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Can't you renew it?

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,280
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
lot.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
Well, I can help you pack.

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,760
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,520
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,760
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

34
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,320
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

36
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:39,000
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sure.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,240
All right, we're back.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,400
So well, it's not much of a big deal.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,440
I guess if you have your parents nearby, you can just move back in with your parents.

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,000
Easier said than done.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
True.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
True.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,400
We'll get to that in a little bit, but let's take a look at the words that are used today

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,600
All right, so this first one is an important one because generally when you're looking

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,760
for a house or an apartment, there are two things you can do.

49
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,760
You can buy a house or you can lease a house or apartment.

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,080
So lease here, Marco.

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,140
It's basically to rent, right?

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,080
It's a contract where you agree to pay a monthly or a quarterly fee for using that house or

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
apartment.

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,240
So do you own your apartment or do you lease it?

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,720
No, mine, I lease.

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
I am not a homeowner yet.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Right.

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,560
So owning a home is a lot more expensive at one kind of period where you have to just

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,760
pay in and you have maybe a mortgage.

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,260
But leasing is just a monthly fee, like you said.

61
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,080
So in this case, they had to leave because their lease was expired.

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Exactly.

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,160
So you can, at the end of a lease, do one of two things.

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
You can stop and you can find a new apartment or you can renew your lease.

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
All right.

66
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
And that's our next word.

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,200
To renew your lease basically means to?

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
To continue.

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
To continue.

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,540
And this is actually a good word because it can be used with any contract because really

71
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,720
a lease is a kind of contract.

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
And so I can say, I renewed my job contract.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
Or maybe a magazine subscription.

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,300
You renewed your magazine subscription.

75
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,120
It's a way of saying that you've committed to paying for the next six months or one year.

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Okay.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, and after that, as we said, the person decided to move in with the parents.

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
So move in.

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Move in.

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,720
Well, we can say he moved his car.

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,280
He put it in a different place.

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,880
But to move in is actually to change houses or to change apartments.

83
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,360
And you're literally moving your things and you're moving your clothes and you're moving

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
into a new home.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,080
So you're living in a new place.

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,320
So in this case, this person is going to live with the parents.

87
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Move in.

88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
All right.

89
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,480
And our next word is when you have to move, you have to pack.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Okay.

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,760
So you can pack a lot of things.

92
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,960
In this case, you're packing a box with all of your belongings, your books and your pillows

93
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
and all that.

94
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,960
But you can also pack a suitcase or you can pack luggage.

95
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,840
So packing is putting things into something so that you can move them.

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
So you can carry them or take them somewhere.

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Exactly.

98
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,120
So in this case, you have to pack your things, put them in boxes to take them to your new

99
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,520
home.

100
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,240
And our last word is an acronym when you said ASAP.

101
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
All right.

102
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Snap, snap.

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Come on.

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
ASAP, Marco.

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
ASAP.

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Describe this for us quickly.

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
All right.

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,960
So ASAP is an acronym for as soon as possible.

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Okay.

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,520
So you often see this in the office on envelopes or emails.

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,200
So please respond ASAP.

112
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,920
This means please respond right away.

113
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
As soon as you can.

114
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
As soon as possible.

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
All right.

116
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,240
So five great words that we've just taken a look at.

117
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be right back.

118
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,360
Okay.

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
That's fine.

120
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Bye.

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
What happened?

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
That's it.

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
My lease is up.

124
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I have to move.

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
What?

126
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Why?

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Can't you renew it?

128
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,240
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
lot.

130
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,140
Well, I can help you pack.

131
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,960
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

132
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,440
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,640
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

134
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,960
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

135
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,320
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,520
Sure.

138
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
All right, we're back and we have a couple of different phrases for you.

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,520
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

140
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Fluency Builder.

141
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
Our first one's a little bit unusual.

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,560
We heard the phrase, my lease is up.

143
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,320
So Marco, let's talk about this phrase, to be up.

144
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
All right.

145
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,280
So if something is up, as in this case, the lease, it means it's expired.

146
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
It's finished.

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Right?

148
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
So it's over.

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
It's over.

150
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,640
So it's like, our time is up.

151
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Right.

152
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
If we have a meeting.

153
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,320
So that's all the time I have, time to go away.

154
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Time is up.

155
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Very good.

156
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,680
So it's always related to time or maybe a contract, as in this case, or your lease is

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
up.

158
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
So it means over or finished.

159
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
All right.

160
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,400
So moving on to our second phrase.

161
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
To make way for.

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
All right.

163
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
So this is a great one.

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,040
This often makes me think of kings and queens in the old days.

165
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,640
They say, make way for the king.

166
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,160
So you have to get out of the way.

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Yeah.

168
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,040
So they try to clear some space for them to move because there's too much stuff in the

169
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
way.

170
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,320
And so in this case, the owner of the apartment with the guy was living in is trying to make

171
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,920
some space or make way for a parking lot.

172
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Right.

173
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,720
So he's basically going to sell the building or house and build a parking lot instead.

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
So they are making way for the new parking lot.

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
They're clearing space.

176
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,540
And this is actually really sad because my childhood home, they destroyed to make way

177
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,760
for a larger, ugly, big house.

178
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Really?

179
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Yeah.

180
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
It happens all the time.

181
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,640
Now they're making way for malls and big buildings and all of our little houses are destroyed.

182
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,820
And well, moving on to our last phrase, the person asked the friend if he would mind looking

183
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,880
after the pet snake and tarantula.

184
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,280
I would mind.

185
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
You don't like snakes or tarantulas?

186
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,800
Well, I don't mind them as long as I don't live with them.

187
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,320
So would you mind?

188
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,000
This is a nice way to start a sentence if you want to ask for a favor, right?

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Exactly.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So here's an alternative.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
Hey, Marco, can you do this for me?

192
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I could, maybe.

193
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,000
I could say, Marco, would you mind doing this for me?

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's more polite.

195
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,280
It is more polite and it's a little bit gentler.

196
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,200
So it's a nice way of asking someone for a favor.

197
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Exactly.

198
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,720
And that's why this is funny because the favor is not like, would you mind watching my kitty?

199
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,400
The favor is, would you mind watching my poisonous pets?

200
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Right.

201
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
All right.

202
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,040
So would you mind it?

203
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,820
But in the end, the person agreed.

204
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,480
So it works, right?

205
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
It does work.

206
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,760
So would you mind, so listeners, would you mind listening to today's dialogue one more

207
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:19,400
time at its normal speed before we come back to you and talk more about renting an apartment?

208
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay, that's fine.

209
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Bye.

210
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
What happened?

211
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
That's it.

212
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
My lease is up.

213
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I have to move.

214
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
What?

215
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Why?

216
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Can't you renew it?

217
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,920
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking

218
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
lot.

219
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,840
Well, I can help you pack.

220
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,280
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

221
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,160
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

222
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,400
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

223
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

224
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,960
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

225
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

226
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Sure.

227
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,960
All right, so moving in.

228
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,920
Now, you have different stages in your life, right?

229
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,760
When you move out, for example, you move out of your parents' home and you live on your

230
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,520
own and then maybe, like in this case, you would move back in with your parents.

231
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
How do you see that happening?

232
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
I see it very often.

233
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,040
My brother just moved back in with my parents.

234
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Really?

235
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,480
Yeah, I think that it depends on the person, honestly.

236
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,640
I mean, especially because the economy has really been suffering for the last year.

237
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,000
A lot of people are doing this because, you know, in a lot of cities in America, you can

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,560
spend a thousand to two thousand dollars a month for an apartment to rent.

239
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
And that's a small apartment or a shared apartment.

240
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,440
And so I understand this is a really well, it's a better option now than it was before

241
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,400
because everyone wants independence.

242
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,440
But sometimes you just can't afford it.

243
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Exactly.

244
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,560
And it's a cultural thing because some people move out of their parents' home, maybe for

245
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
college.

246
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,280
It's very common in the US for students to study in another city or another state.

247
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Right.

248
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,680
And but then maybe coming back home and moving in with your parents or in other cultures,

249
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,000
maybe they don't move out at all.

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,440
Maybe they only move out once they're married.

251
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Exactly.

252
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,280
And a lot of people in China, I think in Shanghai specifically, don't move out until don't move

253
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,440
out of their parents' home until they're going to get married.

254
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Right.

255
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,880
And it does make sense in many big metropolises, because, as you say, rent is expensive.

256
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,320
Living on your own is expensive.

257
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,120
And, well, you don't have anyone to share those costs with like gas, water, electricity,

258
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
even food.

259
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Right.

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
It's cheaper.

261
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
More people.

262
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,240
And not to mention a little bit scary living on your own for the first time.

263
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,660
It is a little bit scary.

264
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,520
What about having somebody move in with you, maybe a roommate or a girlfriend or boyfriend?

265
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
That's always the big step.

266
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
The big commitment.

267
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
The big commitment.

268
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,400
You're in a relationship and you ask your partner to move in with you.

269
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,520
Yeah.

270
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,560
The step before marriage, I guess.

271
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Wow.

272
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
There's nothing before that?

273
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Nothing before marriage?

274
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
No.

275
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
That's pretty much it.

276
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
You tell me.

277
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
I don't know.

278
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
All right.

279
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,720
That's all the time we have for today.

280
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,200
