00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,920
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,760
My name is Catherine and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson about something

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
very technical.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,360
We're talking about marketing strategies here today.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
That's right.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,640
Today we have an upper intermediate lesson at the office.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,280
That is the category of this lesson and we're basically talking about marketing, a marketing

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,400
plan and a lot of technical words around this part of business.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,280
All right, so let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in just a moment

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,400
to talk about what's going on.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,200
Okay, everyone, let's begin.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,320
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,320
I wanted to reemphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,200
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees and they are drawing

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
in more customers.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,640
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,720
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
level of our competitors.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,080
We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,120
sales.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,240
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,200
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,680
They only care about price.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
I disagree.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,760
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,240
at the other places.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,280
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
coffees.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,520
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,520
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks and we will

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,320
not do so now.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
That's true.

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,400
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews and

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,360
it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,640
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,480
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,600
Money is tight for everyone these days.

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,160
So even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Since the security of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,460
sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,260
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the

44
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,360
essence of the company that way?

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,040
The customer always comes first and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
All right, we're back.

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,000
So a very interesting dialogue.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,360
I think this is something very common that would go on in a meeting room when the marketing

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
department is talking about prices and how do we increase sales, etc.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,320
So I think we had a lot of difficult words or maybe words that we didn't really understand

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
well.

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,320
So let's take a look at some of those in Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,240
Language Takeaway.

56
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,760
So the first word on the top of our list today is recession.

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,840
Anyone looking at the news this year or last year probably knows what this word means,

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
but let's talk about it anyway.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is a recession?

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,480
So someone was talking about the recession and basically it is a noun.

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,440
And it means that people don't have enough money like before and so consequently services

63
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,400
are decreased, people aren't buying as much, so there is a lack of commerce going on in

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,240
a country, a region, or a city, etc.

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,600
So basically in economics you have these different cycles.

66
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
It's not like the economy is always the same.

67
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,840
And so sometimes when there's not enough money we call it a recession and we can say, hey,

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,800
I don't have much money to spend right now, we are in a recession.

69
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
So that's a very common way to use the term.

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
That's right.

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,360
So as you said, it's an economic term and many consequences because of this lack of

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
jobs.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
It's just, as you said, a cycle.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,840
And so apart from a recession, that's why they are brainstorming to see how they can

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
increase sales despite the recession.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,560
They also talked about their customers and that their customers are highly discerning.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,840
Alright so this word discerning comes from the verb to discern.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,360
And it's a really important one because it means to be able to tell the difference, to

79
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,280
understand the difference between two different things.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,400
Okay so let's say we have two cups of soda.

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,120
I'm very good at tasting things so I can discern the difference.

82
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
I can discern the difference between these two.

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,040
I can say one is Coca-Cola and one is Pepsi.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,160
Okay so to discern is to be able to tell the difference or to notice the difference between

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,680
many things.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,440
And so obviously you are a discerning person.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Or you have discerning taste.

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,680
This means that you're very good at telling when something is high quality and when it's

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,080
not high quality.

90
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,920
And well talking about discerning customers who know what they want.

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,080
And so they talked about their coffee beans and it's one of their core competencies.

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,760
Okay so this is something you might actually hear in education as well as in business.

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,880
Something is your competency if you are able to do it.

94
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,400
Alright so I am able to write Chinese characters.

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,360
It's one of my core competencies.

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,400
Okay so that's something that I'm able to do so I consider it one of these central or

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,200
important abilities.

98
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,720
But you always talk about competencies within the context of some area.

99
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,160
So my language skills or in this case at a company we're talking about making a coffee.

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,880
One of the company's core competencies is making their coffee beans.

101
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
That's something they're good at.

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,920
That's right and core when we talk about core we talk about the center.

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,760
We talk about one of the most important things.

104
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
That's right.

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,800
Okay and well for the last word that we've prepared to you on Language Takeaway we talked

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,760
about them worrying that you know selling the coffee beans might undermine the essence

107
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,960
of the company.

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
To undermine.

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,680
Okay this is a really important verb and you'll hear this a lot actually in TV shows and especially

110
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
in dramas.

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,320
Say he's undermining my authority or he's undermining my power.

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,200
This means that someone is challenging it or someone is kind of taking it away from

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
you.

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,040
So to undermine is to as you said challenge or try to take something from you very sneaky

115
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,720
in a sneaky way sometimes.

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
That's right.

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,360
So for example if I'm the president of a country and someone is trying to take that away from

118
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,600
me someone is trying to be the president and trying to take down my government.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,440
He is trying to undermine my power.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay very good.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,080
So four key words there on Language Takeaway.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,760
Now we're going to move on to Fluency Builder where we prepared a lot of nice and very good

123
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,400
phrases.

124
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,840
Fluency Builder.

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,600
All right so on Fluency Builder why don't we start up from the beginning of the dialogue

126
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,120
when they were talking about the prices of the coffee and that other shops have reduced

127
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
their prices and so they're drawing in more customers.

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,360
All right so the key here is to draw in.

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
This is a phrase.

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Most people will know the word to draw you know to make a design on a page.

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,120
But to draw in has a very special meaning.

132
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,700
It means to attract.

133
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,240
Okay so you want to attract more customers.

134
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
You want to bring them into the shop.

135
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
So you're trying to draw them in.

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,200
So Marco what's a good example of something that a company will do to try and draw in

137
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
customers.

138
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,280
For example many of you maybe have seen in fast food restaurants when they have a promotion

139
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,640
like you buy one hamburger and you get another one for free.

140
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,720
So that's maybe one of the strategies that they're trying to do to draw in customers

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
and maybe not make money but give people the opportunity to taste their good food.

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
That's right.

143
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,240
All right so the next phrase we've got here is a little bit different.

144
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,880
It's talking about the kind of product that they have.

145
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,240
They're talking about their coffee beans and they say that they're roasted and that they

146
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,440
use state of the art equipment to brew the coffee.

147
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,920
So this phrase state of the art.

148
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
What does this mean?

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,840
Okay if something is state of the art, okay, we're usually talking about a machine and

150
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,280
we're saying that it's the latest in technology.

151
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
It's very very new.

152
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,560
It's highly advanced.

153
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,760
It's a very technologically advanced machine.

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,200
So for example the new iPhone 4 is a state of the art cell phone.

155
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,440
That means it's the very highest that technology has to offer.

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,840
And obviously something that is state of the art is not state of the art forever because

157
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,080
technology changes and so maybe next year there will be a new state of the art telephone.

158
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
That's right.

159
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,960
So if you notice the spelling as well we have little hyphens between each word.

160
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,680
State of the art because we take it as a chunk all together, right?

161
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
That's right.

162
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,960
And following that we have another phrase that is used to talk about products.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,840
They say when you compare the coffees we have side by side, our coffee wins against our

164
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
competitors.

165
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,320
So side by side.

166
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,000
In this case the phrase there is side by side and they're talking about comparing coffees

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,120
side by side.

168
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,320
So I think this is pretty literal.

169
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,480
It's basically saying you put two coffee mugs or coffee cups together side by side and you

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,800
have people taste and then you see which one they prefer.

171
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
That's right.

172
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,680
So you can say this when you're making comparisons.

173
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,220
When I look at them side by side I think I like the pink one more than the red one.

174
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,080
So you are comparing, you are literally putting them next to each other to make a choice of

175
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,800
which one is your preference.

176
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
That's right.

177
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,360
Okay now moving on we have a very interesting phrase when they were talking about the company

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,360
and they've achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to best tasting brews.

179
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,900
So this phrase top of mind awareness very closely related to marketing.

180
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,120
What are we talking about here?

181
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,640
Well let's look at the individual words.

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,800
We have top which is on top not on bottom, mind which is your head or your thinking and

183
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
awareness which is the way that you see things.

184
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,400
And so let's take a guess here and say that when I think of a category of product like

185
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,680
coffee for example, what is the first thing that comes into my mind?

186
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
That's right.

187
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,720
So it's actually a very cool game that you can sometimes play with friends.

188
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,880
Basically just say okay when you think of coffee what is the first brand that comes

189
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
into your mind?

190
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Starbucks.

191
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Starbucks.

192
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,480
So that for example shows that Starbucks has put in you a certain top of mind awareness.

193
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,880
You associate coffee with Starbucks immediately.

194
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,760
You don't say Costa Coffee, you don't say Coffee Bean or any other brand.

195
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Right?

196
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,880
Yeah, no definitely this is a way for you to really test what companies, what corporations

197
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,840
have the most effective marketing because obviously they're the ones who make you think

198
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
of this thing.

199
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
That's right.

200
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,200
They have lots of marketing campaigns.

201
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
That's right.

202
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
So it's actually very interesting.

203
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,280
So you can say top of mind or you can say top of mind awareness.

204
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,920
You can say Honda has great top of mind among their clients.

205
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
Or Ferrari has great top of mind among luxury vehicles.

206
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
That's right.

207
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Okay.

208
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,440
And now for the last phrase when we talked about money again, this is a very nice colloquial

209
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,800
way of saying that you don't have a lot of money or money is very scarce right now.

210
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
Alright, so the phrase is money is tight.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Alright?

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,160
So you know the word tight, you can hold something tightly or this belt is tight, I'm gaining

213
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
weight.

214
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,600
But in this case, money is tight, that's a phrase we take as a chunk and it means like

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,280
you say Marco, I just don't have much money right now.

216
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,360
So money is tight right now.

217
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,160
Now it's interesting because you can say it money is tight and then the subject.

218
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Money is tight for Bill right now.

219
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,180
Or you can say Bill is tight for money at the moment.

220
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,560
So you can switch it up depending on where you put the subject, towards the end or in

221
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
the beginning.

222
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,080
Alright, so usually you hear the phrase money is tight right now or money is really tight,

223
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,560
just kind of on its own and it's a way to say I don't have much cash.

224
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
That's right.

225
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Okay.

226
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,760
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and phrases here.

227
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:29,840
Let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

228
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,200
Okay everyone, let's begin.

229
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,360
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

230
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I wanted to reemphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee

231
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,560
and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

232
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,240
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees and they are drawing

233
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
in more customers.

234
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,680
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

235
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,760
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the

236
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,440
level of our competitors.

237
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,240
We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term

238
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
sales.

239
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,280
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

240
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

241
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,720
They only care about price.

242
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,320
I disagree.

243
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,800
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy

244
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
at the other places.

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,320
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our

246
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
coffees.

247
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,520
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

248
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,520
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks and we will

249
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,320
not do so now.

250
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
That's true.

251
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,400
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews and

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,360
it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

253
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,640
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

254
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,480
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

255
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,120
Money is tight for everyone these days, so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering

256
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,680
the money they pay for their morning coffee.

257
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,760
Since the security of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we

258
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,480
sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

259
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,280
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the

260
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,360
essence of the company that way?

261
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,960
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

262
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,960
The customer always comes first and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

263
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,880
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:32,320
All right, so going back to top-of-mind awareness, let's test what brands are in your head.

265
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,320
For example, when you think of a luxury sports car, what do you think?

266
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Ferrari.

267
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,600
Ferrari, you mentioned it before.

268
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Or Lamborghini.

269
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,960
Or Lamborghini, but you said Ferrari first.

270
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,640
When you think of a brand of cigarettes, what do you think?

271
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Camel.

272
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Camel, okay.

273
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
This is an American brand.

274
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,880
I don't think it's found very commonly in other places.

275
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
They have it in Europe.

276
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
It's very popular.

277
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Oh, really?

278
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Yep.

279
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Okay.

280
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
What about when you think of computers, what do you think?

281
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
For some reason, IBM.

282
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,720
IBM, even though you don't own an IBM.

283
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
I don't, but I grew up around the IBM revolution.

284
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
Okay, see, this is interesting.

285
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,840
So actually, it doesn't always work that way, that because you have a brand in your mind,

286
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,160
it doesn't necessarily mean that you will purchase it in the future if you have the

287
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,280
power to, but at least you are aware of the brand and you recognize it, and the chances

288
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,200
are that you will buy it.

289
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,680
That's right, and you're going to be familiar with it when you read about it or when people

290
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
talk about it.

291
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,840
So for example, I own a Mac computer, Apple, but when I think of computers, I just think

292
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,200
of IBM because we used to say, remember, IBM compatible.

293
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Nah, that's right, IBM compatible, because before it was usually just Mac.

294
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Everything was for Mac.

295
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,040
Mac or IBM.

296
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
And then all of a sudden, it's PC or Mac.

297
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Right.

298
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,440
Actually, that's interesting, though, because if probably, if I say, what do you think of

299
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,040
when you think of, what brand comes to mind when you think of MP3 players?

300
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,640
Apple, the iPod.

301
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,280
You probably think iPod.

302
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,800
That's probably one of the most famous ones, but maybe if you ask somebody about 10 years

303
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,000
ago, when you think about a music player, what do you think about?

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,240
Sony, the Sony Walkman.

305
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,760
The Sony Walkman, right, or the Sony Discman.

306
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
That's right, had both.

307
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,280
It was like I had a Walkman, it was bright yellow.

308
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
So this is really interesting.

309
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,040
This is the way that you see more or less, you can start to realize what brands are in

310
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,840
your mind and maybe unconsciously, you may not even be a smoker, but maybe some sort

311
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
of cigarette brand will be in your mind.

312
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,860
Or maybe you don't even really like sports cars, but you will have a sports car brand

313
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
in your mind.

314
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,040
I'm very curious to hear what you guys have to say, because obviously, the brands that

315
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,400
we're aware of are dependent on where we come from and the marketing campaigns in our home

316
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
countries and also our age.

317
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,000
I was a teenager when I had the Sony Discman, so that made an impact on me.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,040
But let's throw that out to you guys.

319
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,000
Let us know what you think of when we say luxury cars or MP3 players or computers.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,880
Or maybe even basic things like detergents.

321
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,580
For example, if you ask somebody in the United States, they might say Tide.

322
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,640
But if you ask somebody in South America, they might say, I don't know, Omo.

323
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
It's some type of brand.

324
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,080
So, this is also very interesting to see what your local brands have been doing.

325
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
That's right.

326
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
So, let us know what you're thinking.

327
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,200
We're on EnglishPod.com.

328
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
We hope to see you there.

329
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
All right.

330
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:48,520
Take care.
