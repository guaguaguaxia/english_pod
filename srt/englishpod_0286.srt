00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,280
My name is Catherine and today we have the continuation of our series about giving a

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
presentation.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
That's right.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,400
Today it's part six and on this occasion we're going to address the audience.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,040
So we're going to talk to the audience and explain a couple of things.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,040
All right.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,560
So let's take a listen to today's speech and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,960
going on.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,560
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative and revolutionary.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,760
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,320
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you,

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
we really could not have devised this campaign.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,560
so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
to alpha computers.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,720
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here and together we can really

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,680
push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,920
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,360
How do we define the perfect laptop?

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,160
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,080
What do you look for in a consumer?

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,800
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,880
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,340
for all of your computing needs.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,160
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,880
We have a great ad campaign planned, focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,760
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,080
completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,800
I'm excited to say that today for the first time we will unveil to all of you here the

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
first of these advertisements.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:14,960
All right, we're back and now let's take a look at five key words on Language Takeaway.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,680
All right, so first up, Marco, we have a verb.

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,200
The verb is to devise.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,080
That's right, so we devised a campaign.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,240
Okay, so to devise in this case means to create or to come up with.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
That's right.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,960
I think in many movies you will hear that someone will devise a plan to destroy the

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,160
world for example.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,240
Right, or to devise a scheme.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,800
So that's to create or to come up with a plan or come up with something.

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,080
And talking about the computers, he mentioned a couple of words that describe it, especially

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,840
the affordability of the laptop computer.

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Okay, so yeah, there's this string of nouns that Mr. Ford thinks are very important relating

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,160
to the perfect laptop.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,640
And in this case, affordability is the first one.

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,000
So something that is affordable is something that you can have the money to buy.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,640
It's not too expensive.

51
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,080
That's the adjective affordable.

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,960
Affordability means whether or not something is expensive.

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
That's right.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,760
So if you think of the adjective affordable, the noun would be affordability.

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,360
So this is just the way that you can transform an adjective into a noun.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,560
Right, so this is something that comes up a lot when we're talking about buying things.

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,000
For example, Marco, I could say, what do you look for when you're buying a car?

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,160
Right, so I can say affordability.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,160
And you could also say our next one, which is reliability.

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
That's right.

61
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,660
So if you look for a car, you are also looking for reliability.

62
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,600
And this comes from the adjective reliable.

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,800
All right, so something is reliable if you can depend on it.

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,480
It means, you know, in the case of a laptop or a car, it won't break easily.

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
That's right.

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Or a person can also be reliable.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,960
You can trust that person to help you, for example.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Or I can trust that he'll never be late or never forget that we have an appointment.

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,240
That's exactly right.

70
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,720
Well, moving on to the next part of Mr. Ford's speech, he talked about the television campaign

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,640
and how he really hopes to reach out to a huge audience with this television advert.

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,480
All right, so the reason we've chosen this is because it's important to remember this

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,000
as a phrase to reach out to.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,320
That means to connect with.

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,180
And I think your example of television is a really great one because television allows

76
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,480
people to reach out to many, many, many people.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
That's right.

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,200
Also, for example, with Internet, you are able to reach out to many people all over

79
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
the world.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,440
So, to reach out to is to connect with.

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Okay.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,600
And for our last word, when he was about to show everyone the TV advert, he said that

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,760
tonight for the first time we will unveil the first of these advertisements.

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
All right.

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,840
So, to unveil something is actually very exciting because to unveil something is to show it

86
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,880
for the very first time.

87
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
That's right.

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,400
So, maybe you've seen in car shows where they have a car under a big white sheet.

89
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,440
And on that night, they're going to unveil the new model of the, I don't know, the Ford

90
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
car.

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,040
So, that's what it means, to unveil, to take away this veil and show everyone.

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
To unveil.

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
All right.

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,160
So, a lot of good key words there.

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,680
Why don't we go back and listen to Mr. Ford again?

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,600
And when we return, we'll talk about Fluency Builder.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,180
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

98
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,400
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,920
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you,

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,840
we really could not have devised this campaign.

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,040
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,200
so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,960
to Alpha Computers.

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,340
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here and together we can really

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:28,280
push Alpha Computers to a whole new level of success.

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,520
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

107
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,980
How do we define the perfect laptop?

108
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,760
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

109
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
What do you look for in a consumer?

110
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,420
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

111
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,520
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop

112
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,960
for all of your computing needs.

113
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,780
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

114
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,520
We have a great ad campaign planned, focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

115
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,400
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already

116
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,720
completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm excited to say that today for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the

118
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:28,640
first of these advertisements.

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,920
Alright we're back, so now let's take a look at these four key phrases we've picked out

120
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,240
for you today.

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Fluency Builder

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,480
So in the beginning, Mr. Ford is talking about this exciting X420 and he says that, you know,

123
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,320
he would like to say that without the help of each and every one of you, the campaign

124
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,720
could not have been created.

125
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,520
So each and every one of you.

126
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
That's right.

127
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,120
This is just a phrase where you emphasize that everyone helped you or that you are thanking

128
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
everyone.

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,480
So in a speech, you can say, I want to thank each and every one of you.

130
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,800
So I want to thank everyone is basically what you're saying.

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,940
And it's, it's interesting because it's kind of like you're saying every single person

132
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
was important.

133
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
Right.

134
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,800
So it's not just like, Hey guys, thank you.

135
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,320
It's like, no, thank you.

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,640
And you and you and you.

137
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,440
So each and every one of you, it really emphasizes that each person has helped.

138
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
That's right.

139
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,280
And it's a really nice way of, for example, thanking someone saying, I want to thank each

140
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
and every one of you.

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
It sounds a lot more personal.

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Definitely.

143
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Okay.

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,080
And he also used another very interesting phrase when he said, I'd like to take my hat

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,060
off and really thank you all for your wonderful work.

146
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:47,040
So this makes me think of a person actually back when people used to wear hats every day,

147
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,140
taking his hat off and maybe bowing.

148
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,520
This is something that used to be very polite because you know, when you meet someone or

149
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,560
you want to thank someone, you take your hat off as a sign of respect.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,320
Well we don't wear hats anymore, so it seems a little funny, but we still say this.

151
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,200
I want to take my hat off to Marco.

152
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
That means I want to thank you.

153
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
That's right.

154
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,600
So you're showing respect and you're also showing admiration maybe for someone.

155
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,200
So maybe if you meet somebody who saved someone's life, you would say, I really want to take

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,320
my hat off and thank you for the work that you've done.

157
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Yes.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
You're impressed.

159
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,600
You respect that person who saved that life and you want to thank them for their good

160
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
deed.

161
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
That's right.

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Well, moving on, when he continued to talk about Alpha Computers and the marketing efforts,

163
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,440
he said, there's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce.

164
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
All right.

165
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,720
So another way to say this is, I definitely think we have a great workforce.

166
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
That's right.

167
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,200
You know, maybe not.

168
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
It's not as interesting, right?

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,840
So we're making this more interesting by using a very colorful phrase and to say, there's

170
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,480
no doubt that you're a great workforce is good, but there's no doubt in my mind means

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
there's absolutely no way that I could doubt this.

172
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,760
I absolutely believe that you are the best workforce.

173
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Right.

174
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
So, and you can use it with anything.

175
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,000
You can say, there's no doubt in my mind, IBM computers are the best computers out there,

176
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
for example.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,440
Or there's no doubt in my mind that the Yankees will win the World Series next year.

178
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
That's right.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Okay.

180
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
So that's the way that you can use it.

181
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,080
You're basically telling people that you are very, very sure.

182
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,920
And what about our last phrase?

183
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,600
The very interesting one when he says, our campaign will really hammer home the point.

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
Okay, well, you can make a point.

185
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,480
You can say, listen, our computers are state of the art and they're the best for your needs.

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,880
But to hammer home the point means to really emphasize this one important point and to

187
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
say, listen, you will never forget this.

188
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Okay.

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,400
You will not forget what I'm going to say to you.

190
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,380
So you really emphasize it and restate it.

191
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,660
This is something that can be frustrating when you're a consumer, when you're watching

192
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,480
an advertisement because you hear them say, this is the best product.

193
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
You shouldn't buy other products.

194
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
This is the best product.

195
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,400
And they're hammering home the point.

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
They're repeating this message.

197
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
That's right.

198
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,800
So it's a colloquial phrase that you can use to really, again, put your point across.

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Okay.

200
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,560
So a lot of interesting phrases there.

201
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,360
Why don't we take a break and let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in

202
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
a bit.

203
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:32,160
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

204
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,400
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

205
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,920
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you,

206
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,840
we really could not have devised this campaign.

207
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,020
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done

208
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,180
so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment

209
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,960
to alpha computers.

210
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,320
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here and together we can really

211
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,280
push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

212
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,520
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

213
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,980
How do we define the perfect laptop?

214
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,780
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

215
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,680
What do you look for in a consumer?

216
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,400
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

217
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,480
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop

218
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,940
for all of your computing needs.

219
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,760
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

220
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,480
We have a great ad campaign planned, focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

221
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,360
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already

222
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,680
completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

223
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm excited to say that today for the first time we will unveil to all of you here the

224
00:12:52,280 --> 00:13:05,480
first of these advertisements.

225
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,960
All right, so this was part six of our presentation series.

226
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,840
We still have four more lessons to go all about this, and they're going to get a little

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,000
bit more complicated, and we're going to continue talking.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,240
The next couple of lessons are actually answering questions from the public and many things

229
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
like this.

230
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,320
Yeah, I think they're really useful because sometimes you prepare your presentation, you

231
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,120
feel really good about it, but those questions at the end can be scary because you don't

232
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,120
really know how to answer a question properly in English, or you don't know how to anticipate

233
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,280
a question that you might get from the crowd.

234
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,520
So those are things that we would like to talk about in the next couple of episodes.

235
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,920
That's right, and remember that these phrases and how you see him presenting this laptop

236
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,840
computer, you can still take a lot of the words, a lot of the vocab, a lot of the phrases

237
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,600
and kind of put it into your speech or your presentation.

238
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
You're going to sound great.

239
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Absolutely.

240
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,440
State of the art, save that one.

241
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,480
But that's about it for us here today at EnglishPod.

242
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
We hope you've enjoyed this lesson, and we will see you next time.

243
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
All right, bye.

244
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Bye.
