00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,080
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,480
And my name is Katrin.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,560
And today we've got a very, very useful lesson for all of you out there.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
That's right.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,800
We're bringing you part two of the What If series, which is a small series.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Small.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,240
And it is kind of grammar focused, but it's very, very important because you often want

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,480
to talk about things that don't happen.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,400
We're calling these hypotheticals or conditional statements.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Right.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,320
And there are different types of hypotheticals or conditional statements.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,120
So today we're going to be looking at the third conditional, which is probably the hardest

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,060
one because it uses a little bit of a complex grammar structure.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,640
It's complex and we're actually talking about things that did not happen and that will not

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
happen, right?

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,080
It's impossible to change.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,000
It's impossible to change these because there are things that would have happened in the

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
past but didn't.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,720
Wow, that sounds confusing.

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,760
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll be back to look

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:09,040
at some phrases first.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,840
This is the good life.

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,600
We have it good, don't you think?

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, of course.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,520
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
What do you mean?

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,320
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,400
differently.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
For example?

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,880
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
to.

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
I see.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Yeah, now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,200
town and met Sally.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,280
You see, everything happens for a reason.

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,520
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
Well, I have no regrets.

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,400
I'll drink to that.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,600
All right, so two guys, you know, talking about life.

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I imagine these guys as being, you know, middle age or a little bit older, sitting on a porch,

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
drinking a beer, talking about what could have been.

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
Yeah, exactly.

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,880
They're kind of thinking about the past and the decisions they have made.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Yeah, exactly.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,400
All right, so before we start in the grammar, why don't we take a look at a couple of different

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,920
phrases on Fluency Builder.

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Fluency Builder.

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,120
Well, Marco, this first phrase is a phrase you'll hear very often in English.

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,880
It's a phrase that even has philosophical roots, something we talked a lot about when

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,120
we were studying Socrates back in school.

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,000
But this is the good life.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
The good life.

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,600
We have the good life or I have a good life.

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,380
I have a good life is a very common phrase, but here the good life is an idiom.

57
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,640
So I'm living the good life.

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
It means, you know, I have no complaints about my life.

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
Right, so pretty much you have all your necessities covered.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,740
And maybe you have a good, a nice family and you have a good job and you're just happy.

61
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,920
So this is the good life.

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Very good.

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,560
So you have the good life.

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,520
Now moving on to another phrase that's kind of also philosophical, you know, it says everything

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,920
happens for a reason.

66
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,020
All right.

67
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,640
So this phrase is, well, it's also pretty common.

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,840
People say this when bad things happen, but they also say this when good things happen.

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Yeah.

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,280
So basically you're just saying that it's destiny.

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,120
If this bad thing happened to you, there is a reason for it.

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,720
Maybe you don't see it now, maybe not tomorrow, but maybe later you'll see why.

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,040
This often happens when people lose their jobs.

74
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,120
You say, well, you know, everything happens for a reason.

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,320
Maybe losing this job will allow you to find a better job.

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,500
Or maybe go back to school and study.

77
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,360
Or maybe meet the man or woman of your dreams.

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Right.

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,120
So everything happens for a reason.

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Very good.

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,840
And then the guy agrees and says, well, I'll drink to that.

82
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Okay.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,400
So this is a way for people speaking English to say, listen, I agree with you.

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,720
I like that idea and I will, cheers.

85
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Cheers.

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Right.

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Right.

88
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
So this means we're going to touch our glasses or touch our beer bottles and we're going

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,700
to, you know, think about how this is a, it's a nice thought, you know, everything happens

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,560
for a reason is positive.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,360
It's a way to say, listen, good things can happen from this.

92
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,400
So he's saying, yes, I agree.

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Cheers.

94
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I'll drink to that.

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'll drink to that.

96
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
All right.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Well, pretty interesting phrases.

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,440
You know, they're very common, I guess, like colloquial, right?

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,620
So you can use them in everyday conversation with a friend.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,620
You can.

101
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,840
And, you know, oftentimes we say, for example, something really positive, like, I'm really

102
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,500
glad I have such great friends.

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,240
And then everyone says, oh, I'll drink to that.

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Right.

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
So this is something you'll hear when you're out with friends or with family.

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,880
And they may sound funny at first, but you will recognize them when you're speaking to

107
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
people who speak English.

108
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
All right.

109
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
So, all right.

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,220
So let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and explain the grammar.

111
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,240
This is the good life.

112
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,680
We have it good, don't you think?

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
Yeah, of course.

114
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,840
Although don't you ever wonder what could have been?

115
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,560
What do you mean?

116
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,760
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little

117
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,220
differently.

118
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,520
For example?

119
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,440
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted

120
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
to.

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I see.

122
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Yeah.

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,720
Now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and

124
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
met Sally.

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,200
You see, everything happens for a reason.

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,480
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

127
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Well, I have no regrets.

128
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
I'll drink to that.

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,280
Beep, beep, beep.

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,640
All right.

131
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,960
So now it's time for grammar breakdown.

132
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Grammar breakdown.

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,680
So in grammar breakdown, we're going to look at the two main parts of these phrases that

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,600
allow us to talk about things that didn't happen.

135
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,400
So we're talking about looking back at our life and seeing what decisions and what actions

136
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,320
we made.

137
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,960
And in this case, we have a great sentence here.

138
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,040
If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist.

139
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,080
All right.

140
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,800
So let's look at the first part before the comma.

141
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,440
If I hadn't studied architecture, so now we have the conditional if.

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,960
So Marco, big question.

143
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,280
Did he study architecture?

144
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
He did.

145
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
He did.

146
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,160
So if I hadn't studied architecture, it means I did study architecture.

147
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:50,680
But if I had not studied it, okay, so this is if I could change the past, then what would

148
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I have done?

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,960
I would have become an artist.

150
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Okay.

151
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,280
So he wanted to be an artist, but he didn't become an artist.

152
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
He studied architecture instead.

153
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Right.

154
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Okay.

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Very good.

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
You can see the two parts here.

157
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,040
We have one, the condition, if I hadn't done this thing.

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,200
And then afterwards, we have the result, then I would have become an artist.

159
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
So this is the hypothetical.

160
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Very good.

161
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,700
And when we see the condition, you see the structure of the sentence is had plus verb

162
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,920
in past participle.

163
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,560
So if I hadn't studied architecture, and this is called the past perfect, right?

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,000
And then the result, as you said, would have become, this is the present perfect, have

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,160
or has plus verb in past participle.

166
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's look at another example.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Okay.

169
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,600
So we've got the same idea here, but we've got it flipped.

170
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,920
We've got these two parts in different places.

171
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,280
And so he's pretty much saying, if I hadn't moved to this town, then I wouldn't have gotten

172
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,480
married.

173
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
But what did happen?

174
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,040
He did move to this town and he did get married.

175
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Exactly.

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,820
So then, yeah, like you say, he changed the condition and you can do this.

177
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,320
You can put the condition in the beginning or at the end.

178
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,040
And again, the structure is the same.

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,880
I would have gotten married, right?

180
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,280
Have gotten, this is present perfect, have or has, depending on the subject, plus the

181
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,320
verb in past participle.

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,580
And then the past perfect or the condition, had plus verb in past participle, hadn't moved

183
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
to this town.

184
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
All right.

185
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,640
That's a lot of grammar.

186
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,040
It's a lot of grammar, but it's very easy once you just start using it.

187
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,800
Don't think too much about, okay, what do I do here?

188
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,880
Just, you know, if you get the rhythm and you start using it in the same way, then it

189
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
kind of comes out naturally.

190
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,760
And if you make a little mistake, there's not a big deal because even we do it, you

191
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
know?

192
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Exactly.

193
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
Well, let's try a couple of examples off the top of our heads.

194
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,840
First of all, if I hadn't moved to China, I wouldn't have learned Chinese.

195
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Very good.

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,440
So you did move to China and you did learn Chinese.

197
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Exactly.

198
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
So your turn.

199
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
All right.

200
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,080
If my parents hadn't spoken Spanish to me when I was a kid, I wouldn't have become fluent

201
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
in Spanish.

202
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Okay.

203
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,920
So your parents did speak Spanish to you and you did become fluent in Spanish.

204
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
So not bad.

205
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Right.

206
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,200
So maybe you can use it not only to think about things in the past that you can't change

207
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,120
anymore, but just also, you know, kind of remember or say, you know, oh, if this hadn't

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,040
happened, the result.

209
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,640
Or if I hadn't opened my big mouth, my best friend wouldn't have gotten so angry at me.

210
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Exactly.

211
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,760
So I said something stupid and my friend did get angry and now I feel bad about it.

212
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
It happens.

213
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
All right.

214
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Very good.

215
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
So I hope it's clear.

216
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
It does sound a little bit complicated, but this is what our website is for, right?

217
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,360
So if you have questions or doubts or you want to try and plant your own ideas, you

218
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,080
can come to the website and do it.

219
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,320
Want to make some of your own sentences and practice some of these new things, then come

220
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,160
to our website, post some comments and we are happy to correct and add our own commentary

221
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
on those.

222
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Exactly.

223
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:13,360
So before we go, let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

224
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,160
This is the good life.

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,880
You have it good, don't you think?

226
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah, of course.

227
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,840
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

228
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
What do you mean?

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,600
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little

230
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
differently.

231
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
For example?

232
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,200
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted

233
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
to.

234
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I see.

235
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Yeah.

236
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,360
Now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and

237
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
met Sally.

238
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,560
You see, everything happens for a reason.

239
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,840
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident 10 years ago.

240
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Well, I have no regrets.

241
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,360
I'll drink to that.

242
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,400
All right, we're back.

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,760
So, Catherine, any other regrets maybe in your life apart from opening your mouth?

244
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,800
Any other regrets?

245
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,800
If my parents had spoken Spanish to me as a kid, I would have learned.

246
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,400
But instead, I just learned English and that's all.

247
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Well, your mom is half Swedish, right?

248
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,200
Half Swedish, half Czech.

249
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,680
And she never spoke any of these languages to you?

250
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
No, she didn't speak Swedish or Czech.

251
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,560
Her parents spoke English as their common language, but she grew up speaking Italian

252
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,840
and German.

253
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,520
But she didn't speak to me in those languages.

254
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,960
And then as an adult, she forgot some of them.

255
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,520
And so, because my dad was, well, they're both Americans now, but my dad's American.

256
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,640
They just spoke English to me.

257
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Wow.

258
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
But now you speak Italian.

259
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,280
So, do you ever try and talk to your mom in Italian?

260
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Sometimes.

261
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
My grandmother's Italian is much better.

262
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
So, my grandmother is completely fluent.

263
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,440
So I speak to her in Italian and German as well.

264
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
She's fluent in German too.

265
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,680
And I studied German at school.

266
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,520
See, this is the interesting thing now.

267
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,520
So many people are speaking so many languages.

268
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,080
Even before, if you spoke another foreign language, it was a big deal.

269
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Oh yeah.

270
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
But now it's like a requirement.

271
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,280
You have to at least dominate your own native language and a foreign language, right?

272
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,440
So, if your native language is English, you at least have to speak Spanish or Chinese

273
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,680
or some other language.

274
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Definitely true.

275
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,760
And I think there are a lot of people, a lot of our users that speak maybe two or three

276
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,960
languages and English is just one more.

277
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,840
So, you know, more power to them.

278
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,520
This is a really great skill to have and I think it's really important to keep on going

279
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,560
with it even though it's frustrating sometimes.

280
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,600
And actually, once you've been able, and actually once you mastered two or three different languages,

281
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
then the fourth and fifth just becomes easier.

282
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Actually it's true.

283
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,760
It sounds funny when you hear it because you're like, how could it be easier to learn more?

284
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,560
But your brain starts to understand patterns better, right?

285
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
And so it just becomes more natural for you.

286
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
It just picks up patterns from the two or three other different languages that you dominate.

287
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,240
So it's a weird, it's strange how the brain works.

288
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
You make connections.

289
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Yeah.

290
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
All right, guys.

291
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
